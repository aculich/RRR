# The Reproducibility Lexicon Project

We're hoping to disambiguate various terms used to describe reproducibility. For example, in some fields, Repeatability is used in place of computational reproducibility. In field sciences this is often switched around.

__Rough methodology__

* Search wos for these three major terms
* Grab 10k (or max if less) records
* Parse into manageable csv file with Publication type, authors, title, abstract, keywords, DOI.
* Then visualize these data and go on to step 2.
    * Some viz ideas include looking at distribution across fields, years, and possibly doing some topic modeling on the abstract keywords.
