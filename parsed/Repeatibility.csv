The method is theoptimization of the reaction of MA with 2,3-diaminonaphthalene to afforda naphtodiazepinium ion that present a UV absorption at 311 nm, usefulfor MA determination by HPLC with UV detection. The reaction proceeds inthe presence of 25% acetonitrile at 37 degrees C in 20 min at pH 2 using2,4-pentanedione as internal standard. The method has been applied tohomogenized samples of canned mackerel fillets that were treated with2,3-diaminonaphthalene in an acidic aqueous:acetonitrile mixture. Theproduced naphtodiazepinium ion was extracted in acetonitrile by asalting-out homogeneous liquid-liquid extraction. A standard calibrationwas carried out in the range 0.625-10 nmol/g. The reliability of theprocedure is demonstrated by linearity (r(2) = 0.998), limit ofdetection (0.16 nmol/g), limit of quantification (0.22 nmol/g),repeatibility (RSD 5.57%), and intermediate precision (RSD 8.92%).

The p-type anatase TiO2 thin film was deposited bysol-gel technique on a thermally oxidized [100] p-Si (resistivity 5Omega cm) substrate. Anatase TiO2 phase with [101] nanocrystallinity wasconfirmed with an average particle size of similar to 11 nm from X-raydiffraction and field emission scanning electron microscopic study.Ethanol sensor study, in the resistive mode, was carried out at arelatively low operating temperature range (75 degrees C-175 degrees C)for sensing low concentrations of ethanol in air (5-100 ppm). Responsemagnitude of similar to 146% was observed at 150 degrees C toward100-ppm ethanol (in air) with corresponding response time and recoverytime of 39 and 15 s, respectively. The sensor showed appreciablyhigh-response magnitude (129%) even at low ethanol concentration (5 ppm)with acceptable response and recovery time (54 and 22 s, respectively)at the same operating temperature (150 degrees C). At a particulartemperature, for all the ethanol concentrations, sensor showed minimalbase line resistance drift, thereby offering highly repeatable andstable sensing performance. Ethanol selectivity study against othervolatile organic compounds, such as methanol, acetone, and 2-butanone,was also investigated and was found to be quite promising. Ethanolsensing mechanism for such p-type TiO2 has also been discussed in thelight of corresponding oxygen vacancy model."," 10.1109/JSEN.2014.2345575"," 2015"

The ability to detect differences is essential when selectinga panelist, as well as the repeatability in assessments and theagreement among panelists (or reproducibility), which is our definitionof panel consistency. Our goal in this paper is to identify an efficientmethod to compare evaluation profiles from panelists measuring a givensensory attribute on different samples, assessing the panel'sconsistency. For that we investigate two methods available in theliterature - consonance analysis (Dijksterhuis, 1995), and repeatibilityand reproducibility analysis (Rossi, 2001) - and propose a new method,based on the internal consistency test and the calculation of theCronbach's alpha coefficient (Cronbach, 1951). We tested our propositionusing a dataset from a case study in which beef cubes in stew, used ascombat ration by the American Army, are characterized by a sensory panelusing the Spectrum protocol. Different product formulations based onmilitary specifications yielded eight samples evaluated by ninepanelists in quadruplicate. Twenty-four sensory attributes were assessedby the panelists. Results pointed to the Cronbach's alpha coefficient asbest among the methods tested, which is justified threefold: (i) itallows identifying attributes better understood by panelists, (ii) itgives a ranking of panelists according to their consensus with the restof the panel, and (iii) it is analytically simpler in comparison withother methods.

In addition toother physiological properties, it has clear antiproliferative activityin several types of cancer cell. The concentration of melatoninnecessary to inhibit cell growth is much higher than its bloodphysiological concentrations in some tumor types. For years its indolicnature has impeded proper monitoring, by molecular or immunologicaltechniques, of its uptake by cancer cells. In this work we developed asimple, rapid, and validated analytical method for detection andquantification of MEL inside normal and cancer cells. For this purposewe performed high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis afterliquid-liquid extraction of the indole from biological samples. Themethod was validated, and the correlation coefficient for amounts from0.125 to 1.25 mu g was higher than 0.999, with a range of recovery near100%. Precision was evaluated as repeatibility, and for intermediateprecision, the relative standard deviation was less than 5%. The methodwas used to study the stability of the indole in solution and todetermine intracellular melatonin concentrations in normal (PNT1A) andseveral cancer (LNCaP, DU-145, PC-3) prostate cell lines. IntracellularLOQ/LOD were 7.23/2.83, 23.17/9.07, 4.03/1.83, and 6.51/2.53 nmol L(-1),or 1.82/4.66, 0.56/1.45, 3.26/8.34, and 2.02/5.17 attogram in each cellin PNT1A, LNCaP, DU145, and PC-3 cells, respectively. Because there wasno information about intracellular levels of melatonin inside normal ortumor prostate cells after treatment with the indole, nor a relationshipbetween its antiproliferative activity and its intracellularconcentration, this is the first time that, by using an analyticalmethod combined with measurement of cellular volume by flow cytometry,the intracellular concentration of MEL has been estimated. Also, dataobtained here explain why the antiproliferative properties of MEL varyin different cell types. This is, moreover, the first time that byincreasing the intracellular concentration of melatonin, its antitumorproperties have been promoted in prostate cancer cells. This process canbe monitored by the method developed here."," 10.1007/s00216-010-3653-4"," 2010"

Little isknown of predictive factors of fibrosis. It was suggested that PAI-1,uPA, TGF-beta1, VEGF, IL-8, TNF-alpha influence this process.AIMS: To assess airway inflammatory and fibrosis markers in EBC insarcoidosis and the effect of fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB),bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB)and bronchial mucosa membrane biopsy on their production in the airways.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 11 patients (5 women,6 men; mean age 40 +/- 9 yrs, mean +/- SD) with sarcoidosis stage I-III.PAI-1 (ng/ml), uPA (ng/ml), TGF-beta1 (pg/ml), VEGF (pg/ml), IL-8(pg/ml), TNF-alpha (pg/ml) levels were measured in BALF and EBCcollected before and 48 hours after FOB.RESULTS: No significant changes in EBC levels of VEGF, PAI-1, TGF-beta1,TNF-alpha (respectively: 8.02 +/- 4.97 pg/ml; 1.1 +/- 1.2 ng/ml; 2909.7+/- 206.6 pg/ml; 10.7 +/- 19.9 pg/ml) after FOB were observed whencompared to baseline. In contrast, IL-8 concentration in EBC (pg/ml)decreased after FOB (0.073 +/- 0.13 v. 0.061 +/- 0.1, p = 0.006) and wassignificantly lower than in BALF (BALF 0.95 +/- 0.62, p < 0.05). Also,mean level of VEGF was higher in BALF than in EBC both pre- and post-FOB (BALF 66.38 +/- 36.95, EBC pre-FOB 6.75 +/- 3.67 and EBC post-FOB8.02 +/- 4.97). Significant relationship between TNF-alpha in post-FOBEBC and BALF was also shown (b = 0.63, p = 0.04).CONCLUSIONS: FOB does not significantly affect levels of airwayinflammation and fibrosis markers present in EBC before and after FOB;they were also comparable to the concentrations marked by BALF. The lackof correlation between markers levels in EBC and BALF indicates thatthese methods are not equivalent.

Sampling was performed by forcingatmospheres through silica-gel cartridges coated with2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH), where aldehydes were derivatized toform the corresponding hydrazones, which were then injected and elutedinto the electrophoresis system. Factors affecting both separation anddetection processes were optimized, with best performance achieved byapplying a voltage of 2500V both in the separation and in theelectrokinetic injection (5 s) and using a 15 mM borate buffer (pH 9.2)added with 25 mM of SDS and 20%v/v ACN plus 10%v/v 1-propanol. Underthese optimal conditions, well satisfactory resolution could beachieved, so that the analytes could be separated and detected withinabout 400 s, by applying a detection potential of -1.0 V versus Ag/Ag/Clto the glassy carbon-working electrode. The recorded peaks werecharacterized by both a good repeatibility (RSD < 3%) and a lineardependence over a wide concentration range (2-100 mu g/mL).

A low-capacity (7 mu m) SPME fibre was employed, enabling ashort equilibration time (15 min). The absorbed volatile compounds werethen separated in 12.5 min on a 10 m x 0.1 mm I.D. capillary. The fastGC method was characterized by relatively moderate GC parameters (headpressure: 173 kPa; temperature program rate: 12 degrees C/min). Theemployment of the low-capacity fibre also suited the reduced samplecapacity of the capillary employed, hence column overloading wasavoided. Analytical repeatibility was determined in terms of retentiontimes (maximum RSD: 0.32%) and peak areas (maximum RSD: 9.80%). Theresults obtained were compared to those derived from a conventionalHS-SPME-GC (a 30 mu m SPME fibre and 0.25 mm I.D. capillary were used)application on the same sample.

" J"," Drew, DA"," Probability and repeatibility: One particle diffusion"," NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN"," Many multiphase flow systems involve complex geometry and/or chaoticflows. For this reason, exact solutions to initial value problems(giving, for example, the exact initial positions of all bubbles flowingin a system) contain both too much information and too littleinformation, in a sense that will be made clear. For many purposes, flowdetails (such as ripples on bubbles) can be neglected, or their overalleffect need be considered. Information about such details is extraneous.For some systems, the boundary conditions and initial conditions cannotbe controlled sufficiently to allow repeatable experiments. A correctdetailed prediction for such a system cannot be made because the initialand boundary conditions cannot be specified. Moreover, predictions forsuch a system cannot be compared in detail to the experiment.Consequently, predictions for averages have become the standard forcomplex flow systems. In this paper, the averaging process is elucidatedfor situations where the flow is simple. The central concept is theevolution of an appropriate probability density function. The evolution(rate of change) of the probability density function is studied forlinear, logistic, and Lorenz dynamics. We build the concepts andsolutions toward the problem of turbulent dispersion of particles. Theeffect of uncertainty in the initial conditions, and the dispersion byrandom flow is described for the evolution of a swarm of particles. (c)2005 Elsevier B.V.

In the study, 56 logswere categorized into five different curvature types and four differentdegrees of curvature severity. The logs were run through a Rema 3D logscanner four times, and the external geometry was recorded. From thegeometry data, variables describing log shapes were calculated and usedto develop models using linear discriminant analysis, which was used toclassify the logs according to curvature type. The accuracy andrepeatability were evaluated for the classifications with Cohen's simpleKappa coefficient. The results of this study showed that it is possibleto sort logs by curve type using a 3D log scanner, although sorting bycurve type was largely dependent on curve severity.

Widths were measured manually, by semi-automated methodsusing grey level (densitometric) profiles taken from digital images, andby automated techniques set at different operating levels. Goodintra-session repeatibility was obtained using the automated method withan operating sigma value of 3 pixels (16 mum) (mean difference 0.5 mum,95% CI -8.5 to 9.4 mum) and manual calliper measurements from digitallycreated photographic slides (mean difference 0.4 mum, -9.3 to 10.1 mum).For comparison with other measures of width, the latter was used as thegold standard. Widths measured from film were slightly larger than thosemeasured directly from digital images, although this effect was small (5mum) for most vessels. Overall widths measured using the automatedmethod, with a sigma value of 3 pixels, agreed best with the goldstandard (inter-method repeatibility; mean difference 1.4 mum, -32.5 to35.2 mum) although the automated method overestimated small widths (<40mum) and underestimated larger vessel widths (>40 mum). Automateddetection of vessels of the conjunctiva from digital images avoidsmanual and operator involved measures which are time consuming, andwhich preclude large patient studies. The resulting data may help inmonitoring the vascular response of the conjunctiva to surgical orpharmacological intervention, and in describing vascular changes inresponse to ocular or systemic disease.

When the dynamics and final materialproperties are dominated by atomic scale phenomena, it is difficult toapply existing optimization and control tools to improve processrepeatibility and to optimize the resulting material properties.Currently, feedback loops are used to control sensed quantities, andoptimization has been applied to macroscopic reactor conditions likefluid flow. Ultimately, one would like to directly control the materialproperties that determine the performance of an integrated circuit orMEMS device, even when the property of interest is not directlymeasured. In this paper an integrated control strategy is applied to anatomic scale kinetic Monte Carlo simulation of thin film deposition. Amodel reduction approach developed previously for Monte Carlosimulations is used in the design of the control strategy. An inputtemperature profile that minimizes interface roughness is computed witha gradient optimization, and estimators are designed to infer surfaceroughness from a measurement of the density of steps.

Following the anatomy and literaturedata, we chose six central and peripheral arteries-a. axillaris, a.carotis communis, a. brachialis, a. saphena, a. caudalis mediana, and a.auricularis caudalis. The blood samples were collected from 152 calves(2 weeks-6 months old) and 51 dairy cows. The efficiency of collectionwas evaluated with emphasis on minimizing the restraining and stressingof the animals, because of the possible effects of the animals'responses on blood gases values. In both categories, the results showedthat the most convenient and reliable sampling sites were a. axillarisand a. auricularis caudalis. Both in calves and cows, punctures of a.carotis communis and a. caudalis mediana were less successful because ofmore demanding restraint, the stronger responses of the animals, and theless repeatibility of the sampling, resp. The least efficiency wasrecorded for the punctures of a. brachialis and a. saphena. Moreover, inthese punctures, the difficult restraint of calves in the lateralposition may lead to significant changes in the examined indices."," 10.2754/avb200271030289"," 2002"

Repeated in vivo Doppler imaging of vibrations measurements atthe first tarsometatarsal joint in healthy persons.Background. Clinical hypermobility of the first tarsometatarsal joint isan important factor in a hallux valgus deformity. No objective andnon-invasive test is available to quantify first tarsometatarsal jointmobility. Doppler imaging of vibrations, a technique recently developedto measure joint stiffness, might be an effective tool to quantifystiffness of this joint.Methods.

In the group with congenital single kidney, length, volumeand RBF were all greater In the mononephrectomized patients, length andvolume were greater but RBF was the same as in a normal single kidney.Conclusions: The ultrasonogaphic and Doppler variables studied did notshow any differences from normal distribution but they were influenceddifferently by some demographic parameters; however, the integrated useof these measurements offers precision and repeatibility, and could helpevaluating diffuse or localized abnormalities.",NA," 2000"

Mean B, P, and Asconcentrations were determined for several bulk-doped silicon referencewafers. Absolute concentration calibration scales are determined by NISTStandard Reference Materials (B, As) or accepted Consensus ReferenceMaterials (P), At any single EAG measurement site, the averagerepeatibility of an individual dopant concentration measurement wasabout 0.7% for B, 2.1% for P, and 2.3% for As, Across the four sites,the best reproducibility for concentration measurements was found whenbulk-doped standards were used for calibration.

" B"," De Chiffre, LBelluco, W"," Comparison of methods for cutting fluid performance testing"," CIRP ANNALS 2000: MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY"," A comparison is made of those methods for cutting fluid performanceevaluation that involve metal cutting operations under controlledlaboratory conditions. An analysis in terms of repeatability, resolutionand cost is carried out, based on results from comprehensiveexperimental investigations in turning, drilling, milling, reaming, andtapping. Different workpiece materials, such as carbon steels, stainlesssteels, and aluminium alloys, as well as different kinds of cuttingfluids, including water based products, straight mineral oils, andvegetable oil based formulations, are considered. The analysis iscarried out grouping the tests according to the main measurand: toollife, cutting forces, and workpiece surface finish. The ratio sigma/rho,where sigma is the standard deviation of measurements and rho the rangeof variability of test results, was introduced to express the relativeresolution of a test, and a cost model was developed. It was concludedfrom the analysis that tool life tests are connected with limitedrepeatibility (sigma=10-50%) and resolution (sigma/rho ranging from0.25-0.75), with costs ranging from 1000 Euro to 2000 Euro. Tests basedon cutting forces are connected with a much better repeatibility andresolution, featuring values for sigma in the range 0.5-6% and asigma/rho ratio of approximately 0.2, with test costs of about 500 Euro.Surface finish tests feature repeatabilities of approximately 50% andresolutions of 0.3-0.4, with costs of approximately 1000 Euro.",NA," 2000"

" J"," Castellini, PScalise, LRevel, GM"," Vibration measurements for diagnosis of structural defects on humanteeth"," MEASUREMENT"," In this paper, the authors propose and analyse a non-invasivemeasurement procedure for the diagnosis of structural defects on humanteeth based on non-contact excitation and measurement of vibration bylaser techniques. The tooth is excited in vibration by Nd:YAG laserpulses, below the ablation threshold, which induces local thermalexpansion with consequent propagation of bending waves. Vibrations arethen measured by Laser Doppler Vibrometry (LDV), which permitsnon-invasive and accurate measurements. The presence of structuraldefects, caused, for example, by caries, can be detected by variation inthe dynamic behaviour of the tooth. The technique and the results ofin-vitro tests on artificially defected human teeth are presented. Themetrological problems connected with measurement repeatibility indifferent operating conditions are addressed. The effect of pulse energylevel has also been measured, with the aim of determining the minimumenergy level sufficient to achieve satisfactory signal-to-noise ratio invibration measurement. In fact, if high-energy pulses are utilised,overheating or ablation on the tooth structure may be caused withserious consequences for the patient. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.
