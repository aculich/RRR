A presumed one-to-one combinationof atoms A and B to form a simple compound AB allowed Dalton toconstruct his first table of relative atomic weights from literatureanalyses of appropriate binary compounds. For such simple binarycompounds, the atomic theory had little advantages over affinity theoryas an explanation of fixed proportions by weight. For ternary compoundsof the form AB(2), however, atomic theory made quantitative predictionsthat were not deducible from affinity theory. Atomic theory requiredthat the weight of B in the compound AB(2) be exactly twice that in thecompound AB. Dalton, Thomas Thomson and William Hyde Wollaston allpublished within a few years of each other experimental data thatclaimed to give the predicted results with the required accuracy. Thereare nonetheless several experimental barriers to obtaining the desiredintegral multiple proportions. In this paper I will discuss replicationexperiments which demonstrate that only Wollaston's results areexperimentally reliable. It is likely that such replicability explainswhy Wollaston's experiments were so influential."," 0"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 0003-3790"," WOS:000352295800002",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the amount ofexplained variance was not very high and the internal consistenciesranged from unsatisfactory to only moderate. The data showed a highpercentage of respondents agreeing with more than three items of theInfrequency scale, which may be attributable to the collectivisticculture in Saudi Arabia.Conclusion: We did not succeed in replicating the ZKPQ structure in theArabic context.

Examination of thecurrent research dependability literature and earlier literaturesdealing with the problem of false findings is used to arrive at a set ofthree core research dependability recommendations: (a) conduct andpromote direct replication studies; (b) ensure data sharing whenrequested by fellow scientists; and (c) adopt and promote a truthseeking mindset during the research endeavor."," 0"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 1089-2680"," WOS:000351586700005",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In contrast, SIVpbj1.9 replicates in initiallyresting T lymphocytes by activating infected cells. Previous reportshave shown that a difference in Nef-mediated T cell activation betweenHIV-1 and SIVpbj1.9 plays a critical role in the differing abilities ofthese viruses to replicate in resting lymphocytes. However, themolecular details of these differences are still unclear. Here, we showthat infection with a chimeric virus, HSIVnef, which harbors the 5' 308nucleotides of SIVpbj1.9 nef in place of the 5' 221 nucleotides of HIV-1nef in the HIV-1 proviral backbone, resulted in integration of theprovirus into host chromosomes without mitogenic activation and therebyreplication in resting human PBMCs (hPBMCs). These results indicate thatNef is an essential viral determinant for the integration of provirusinto host chromosomes in resting T cells. Using the yeast two-hybridsystem, we identified integrase interactor-1 (INI1/SMARCB1) as acellular factor that is involved in the integration process viainteraction with Nef. Although INI1 interacted with both SIVpbj1.9 andHIV-1 Nefs, SIVpbj1.9 Nef, but not HIV-1 Nef, enhanced proviralintegration into host DNA. Furthermore, mutational analysis revealedthat the basic-amino-acid-rich amino-terminal domain in SIVpbj1.9 Nef iscrucial for interaction with INI1 and virus replication in restinghPBMCs. Taken together, these data indicate that Nef is a critical viralprotein for incorporating nascent proviral DNA into host chromosomes inresting PBMCs and that this occurs through interaction with INI1. Thiselucidates the basis for replication of the integrated provirus when thehost cell is in a resting state."," 0"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 0304-8608"," WOS:000350295300011",NA,NA," 25559666",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Committed to the One World, OneHealth (OWOH) movement, their research aims to create a safe andeffective global solution to the conjoined problems of climate changeand an increasing worldwide demand for protein. Their preliminary workis promising, as it suggests that when compared to other sources ofmeat, insects can be an efficient, safe, and low-impact source ofnutrients. Additionally, in many sites with endemic malnutrition, peoplefind insects tasty. The problem these scientists are grappling with,however, is that insects that are easily mass-produced are not theinsects people typically want to eat. This paper shows how thecontingency of edibility complicates existing scientific models oftravel that posit that singular objects spread peripherally outwardsfrom a center into a globally connected, singular world. The scientistsare finding that the production of successful food products necessitatesthat insects be constantly tinkered with: there is no ""insect"" that canbe globally edible since ""the global"" itself is not a singular entity.This in turn complicates the vision of replicability and ""scaling up""inherent in an OWOH vision of science. The researchers' process ofmoving their goods from the laboratory boxes they work with into themealtime practices they seek to impact is compelling them to cultivateand articulate new ideals for research, methods of translation, andpathways by which goods can travel.

Asperger Syndrome (AS) is one subgroup of ASC and differsfrom classic autism in that in AS there is no language or generalcognitive delay. Genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors areimplicated in ASC and genes involved in neural connectivity andneurodevelopment are good candidates for studying the susceptibility toASC. The aryl-hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator 2 (ARNT2) geneencodes a transcription factor involved in neurodevelopmental processes,neuronal connectivity and cellular responses to hypoxia. A mutation inthis gene has been identified in individuals with ASC and singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been nominally associated with ASand autistic traits in previous studies.Methods: In this study, we tested 34 SNPs in ARNT2 for association withAS in 118 cases and 412 controls of Caucasian origin. P values wereadjusted for multiple comparisons, and linkage disequilibrium (LD) amongthe SNPs analysed was calculated in our sample. Finally, SNP annotationallowed functional and structural analyses of the genetic variants inARNT2.

The objective of this study is tobuild a model for predicting the EGFR mutation status of brainmetastasis in patients with NSCLC.Observation and model set-up.This study was conducted between January 2003 and December 2011 in 6medical centers in Southwest China.The study included 31 NSCLC patients with brain metastases.Eligibility requirements were histological proof of NSCLC, as well assufficient quantity of paraffin-embedded lung and brain metastasesspecimens for EGFR mutation detection. The linear discriminant analysis(LDA) method was used for analyzing the dimensional reduction ofclinical features, and a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm wasemployed to generate an EGFR mutation model for NSCLC brain metastases.Training-testing-validation (3 : 1 : 1) processes were applied to findthe best fit in 12 patients (validation test set) with NSCLC and brainmetastases treated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and whole-brainradiotherapy.Primary and secondary outcome measures: EGFR mutation analysis inpatients with NSCLC and brain metastases and the development of aLDA-SVM-based EGFR mutation model for NSCLC brain metastases patients.EGFR mutation discordance between the primary lung tumor and brainmetastases was found in 5 patients. Using LDA, 13 clinical features weretransformed into 9 characteristics, and 3 were selected as primaryvectors. The EGFR mutation model constructed with SVM algorithms had anaccuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for determining the mutationstatus of brain metastases of 0.879, 0.886, and 0.875, respectively.Furthermore, the replicability of our model was confirmed by testing 100random combinations of input values.The LDA-SVM-based model developed in this study could predict the EGFRstatus of brain metastases in this small cohort of patients with NSCLC.Further studies with larger cohorts should be carried out to validateour findings in the clinical setting."," 0"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 0025-7974"," WOS:000349000400002",NA,NA," 25654374",NA," e375",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Reproducibility is a necessary condition for replicability,because an inability to reproduce results implies that the methods havenot been specified sufficiently, thus precluding replication. This paperdescribes how two independent teams of researchers attempted toreproduce the empirical findings of an important paper, ""Shrinkageestimators of time series seasonal factors and their effect onforecasting accuracy"" (Miller & Williams, 2003). The two teams proceededsystematically, reporting results both before and after receivingclarifications from the authors of the original study. The teams wereable to approximately reproduce each other's results, but not those ofMiller and Williams. These discrepancies led to differences in theconclusions as to the conditions under which seasonal dampingoutperforms classical decomposition. The paper specifies the forecastingmethods employed using a flowchart. It is argued that this approach tomethod documentation is complementary to the provision of computer code,as it is accessible to a broader audience of forecasting practitionersand researchers.

Much research work has studied the application ofgamification in software engineering for increasing the engagement andresults of developers.Objective: The objective of this paper is to carry out a systematicmapping of the field of gamification in software engineering in anattempt to characterize the state of the art of this field identifyinggaps and opportunities for further research.Method: We carried out a systematic mapping with a view to finding theprimary studies in the existing literature, which were later classifiedand analyzed according to four criteria: the software process areaaddressed, the gamification elements used, the type of research methodfollowed, and the type of forum in which they were published. Asubjective evaluation of the studies was also carried out to evaluatethem in terms of methodology, empirical evidence, integration with theorganization, and replicability.Results: As a result of the systematic mapping we found 29 primarystudies, published between January 2011 and June 2014. Most of themfocus on software development, and to a lesser extent, requirements,project management, and other support areas. In the main, they considervery simple gamification mechanics such as points and badges, and fewprovide empirical evidence of the impact of gamification.Conclusions: Existing research in the field is quite preliminary, andmore research effort analyzing the impact of gamification in SE would beneeded. Future research work should look at other game mechanics inaddition to the basic ones and should tackle software process areas thathave not been fully studied, such as requirements, project management,maintenance, or testing. Most studies share a lack of methodologicalsupport that would make their proposals replicable in other settings.The integration of gamification with an organization's existing tools isalso an important challenge that needs to be taken up in this field.

Neither short-termhumanitarian aid nor traditional development financing are well adaptedfor such environments. Multi-donor trust funds, in their current form,can be unwieldy and subject to long delays in initiation and work bestwhen national governments are already strong. We reviewed the aidmodalities used in Zimbabwe through the period of crisis, 2008-2012 andtheir results and implications. Literature review and case experiencewas utilised.Discussion: By focusing on working with line ministries in non-contestedsectors to determine local priorities rather than following globalprescriptions, pooling funds to achieve scale rather than deliveringthrough fragmented projects, and building on national systems andcapacities rather than setting up parallel mechanisms, the TransitionFund Model employed in Zimbabwe by UNICEF and partners in partnershipwith the Inclusive Government was able to achieve important results inhealth, education, social support and water services in a challengingsetting. In addition, forums for collaboration were developed thatprovided a platform for further action.

The objectives of thisstudy were to develop, improve and validate a scale independent biomassmodel. Field studies were conducted in Huimin County, Shandong Provinceof China, during the 2006-2007 growing season of winter wheat (Triticumaestivum L). The field design had a multiscale set-up with four levelswhich differed in their management, such as nitrogen fertilizer inputsand cultivars, to create different biomass conditions: smallexperimental fields (L1), large experimental fields (L2), small farmfields (L3), and large farm fields (L4). L4, planted with differentwinter wheat varieties, was managed according to farmers' practice whileLi through L3 represented controlled field experiments. Multitemporalspectral measurements were taken in the fields, and biomass was sampledfor each spectral campaign. In addition, multitemporal Hyperion datawere obtained in 2006 and 2007. Li field data were used to developbiomass models based on the relation between the winter wheat spectraand biomass: several published vegetation indices, including NRI, REP,OSAVI, TCI, and NDVI, were investigated. A new hyperspectral vegetationindex, which uses a four-band combination in the NIR and SWIR domains,named GnyLi, was developed. Following the multiscale concept, the dataof higher levels (L2 through L4) were used stepwise to validate andimprove the models of the lower levels, and to transfer the improvedmodels to the next level. Lastly, the models were transferred andvalidated at the regional scale using Hyperion images of 2006 and 2007.The results showed that the GnyLi and NRI models, which were based onthe NIR and SWIR domains, performed best with R-2 > 0.74. All the otherindices explained less than 60% model variability. Using the Hyperiondata for regionalization, GnyLi and NRI explained 81-89% of the biomassvariability. These results highlighted that GnyLi and NRI can be usedtogether with hyperspectral images for both plot and regional levelbiomass estimation. Nevertheless, additional studies and analyses areneeded to test its replicability in other environmental conditions. (C)2014 Elsevier B.V.

RNA isknown to feature two of the three essential functions of living entities(metabolism, heredity and membrane): it is capable of unlimited heredityand it has a proven capacity for catalysing very different chemicalreactions which may form simple metabolic networks. The MetabolicallyCoupled Replicator System is a class of simulation models built on thesetwo functions to show that an RNA World scenario for the origin of lifeis ecologically feasible, provided that it is played on mineralsurfaces. The fact that RNA templates and their copies are ofcomplementary base sequences has an obvious dynamical relevance:complementary strains may have very different structures and,consequently, functions - one may specialize for increasing enzymaticactivity while the other takes the role of the gene of the enzyme.Results: Incorporating the functional divergence of template and copyinto the Metabolically Coupled Replicator System model framework we showthat sequence complementarity 1) does not ruin the coexistence of a setof metabolically cooperating replicators; 2) the replicator systemremains resistant to, but also tolerant with its parasites; 3) opens theway to the evolutionary differentiation of phenotype and genotypethrough a primitive version of phenotype amplification.Conclusions: The functional asymmetry of complementary RNA strainsresults in a shift of phenotype/genotype (enzyme/gene) proportions inMCRS, favouring a slight genotype dominance. This asymmetry is expectedto reverse due to the evolved trade-off of high ""gene"" replicability andhigh catalytic activity of the corresponding ""enzyme"" in expense of itsreplicability.

Here we propose atask-optimized spatial filtering strategy for uncovering individualmagnetoencephalographic (MEG) responses to audiobook stories. Tensubjects listened to 1-h-long recording once, as well as to 48repetitions of a 1-min-long speech passage. Employing responsereplicability as statistical validity and utilizing unsupervisedlearning methods, we trained spatial filters that were able togeneralize over datasets of an individual. For thisblind-signal-separation (BSS) task, we derived a version of multi-setsimilarity-constrained canonical correlation analysis (SimCCA) thattheoretically provides maximal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in thissetting. Irrespective of significant noise in unaveraged MEG traces, themethod successfully uncovered feasible time courses up to similar to 120Hz, with the most prominent signals below 20 Hz. Individualtrial-to-trial correlations of such time courses reached the level of0.55 (median 0.33 in the group) at similar to 0.5 Hz, with considerablevariation between subjects. By this filtering, the SNR increased up to20 times. In comparison, independent component analysis (ICA) orprincipal component analysis (PCA) did not improve SNR notably. Thevalidity of the extracted brain signals was further assessed byinspecting their associations with the stimulus, as well as by mappingthe contributing cortical signal sources. The results indicate that theproposed methodology effectively reduces noise in MEG recordings to thatextent that brain responses can be seen to nonrecurring audiobookstories. The study paves the way for applications aiming at accuratelymodeling the stimulus-response-relationship by tackling the responsevariability, as well as for real-time monitoring of brain signals ofindividuals in naturalistic experimental conditions.

Potential trade-offs between remedial costs,environmental effects, human health risks, and societal benefits, aswell as fundamental differences in stakeholder priorities, complicatedecision making. Formal decision-analytic tools such as multicriteriadecision analysis (MCDA) move beyond ad hoc decision support toquantitatively and holistically rank management alternatives and addtransparency and replicability to the evaluation process. However, eventhe best decisions made under uncertainty may be found suboptimal inhindsight, once additional scientific, social, economic, or otherdetails become known. Value of information (VoI) analysis extends MCDAby systematically evaluating the impact of uncertainty on a decision.VoI prioritizes future research in terms of expected decision relevanceby helping decision makers estimate the likelihood that additionalinformation will improve decision confidence or change their selectionof a management plan. In this study, VoI analysis evaluates uncertainty,estimates decision confidence, and prioritizes research to informselection of a sediment capping strategy for the dibenzo-p-dioxin and-furan contaminated Grenland fiord system in southern Norway.

However, it is often unclear to what extent a replication attemptresults in success or failure. To quantify replication outcomes wepropose a novel Bayesian replication test that compares the adequacy of2 competing hypotheses. The 1st hypothesis is that of the skeptic andholds that the effect is spurious; this is the null hypothesis thatpostulates a zero effect size, H-0 : delta=0. The 2nd hypothesis is thatof the proponent and holds that the effect is consistent with the onefound in the original study, an effect that can be quantified by aposterior distribution. Hence, the 2nd hypothesis-the replicationhypothesis-is given by H-r : delta similar to ""posterior distributionfrom original study."" The weighted-likelihood ratio between H-0 and H-rquantifies the evidence that the data provide for replication successand failure. In addition to the new test, we present several otherBayesian tests that address different but related questions concerning areplication study. These tests pertain to the independent conclusions ofthe separate experiments, the difference in effect size between theoriginal experiment and the replication attempt, and the overallconclusion based on the pooled results. Together, this suite of Bayesiantests allows a relatively complete formalization of the way in which theresult of a replication attempt alters our knowledge of the phenomenonat hand. The use of all Bayesian replication tests is illustrated with 3examples from the literature.

We examined 29patients with mild to moderate AD and 29 age- and gender-matched healthycontrol subjects with quantitative sensory testing, ie, assessments ofdetection threshold (warmth detection threshold [WDT1) and painthreshold (heat pain threshold [HPT], pressure algometry, cold pressortest), and assessments of tolerance (pressure algometry, cold pressortest). All procedures were done twice on day 1, 1 hour apart, andrepeated on day 2. We found no difference between groups for WDT(patient vs control subjects: mean [95% confidence interval]: 35.5degrees C [33.4 degrees C to 37.6 degrees C] vs 35.4 degrees C [34.3degrees C to 36.5 degrees C], P=.8) or HPT (41.2 degrees C [40.0 degreesC to 42.4 degrees C] vs 423 degrees C [41.1 degrees C to 43.5 degreesC], P=.24). We observed comparable thresholds for pressure algometry(median [25% to 75% interquartile range]: 120 kPa [100 to 142 kPa] vs131 kPa [113 to 192 kPa], P=.10), but significantly lower tolerance inAD patients (213 kPa [188 to 306 kPa] vs 289 kPa [262 to 360 kPa],P=.008). No differences were found for the cold pressor test. The studydemonstrated good replicability of the sensory testing data withcomparable data variability, for both groups, which supports the use ofthese methods in studies of patients with mild to moderate AD. Contraryto previous studies, we observed a reduced pain tolerance in patientswith mild to moderate AD, which suggests that the reduced report of paincannot be explained by reduced processing of painful stimuli.

In this study, we investigated whether the removal ofoutliers in psychology papers is related to weaker evidence (against thenull hypothesis of no effect), a higher prevalence of reporting errors,and smaller sample sizes in these papers compared to papers in the samejournals that did not report the exclusion of outliers from theanalyses.Methods and Findings: We retrieved a total of 2667 statistical resultsof null hypothesis significance tests from 153 articles in mainpsychology journals, and compared results from articles in whichoutliers were removed (N = 92) with results from articles that reportedno exclusion of outliers (N = 61).

A single top-electrode can be used to form upto 15-25 junctions. This method generates SAM-based junctions withhighly reproducible electrical characteristics in terms of precision(widths of distributions) and replicability (closeness to a referencevalue). The reason is that this method, unlike other approaches thatrely on cross-bar or nano/micropore configurations, does not requirepatterning of the bottom-electrodes and is compatible with ultra-flattemplate-stripped (TS) surfaces. This compatibly with non-patternedelectrodes is important for three reasons. i) No edges of the electrodesare present at which SAMs cannot pack well. ii) Patterning requiresphotoresist that may contaminate the electrode and complicate SAMformation. iii) TS-surfaces contain large grains, have low rms values,and can be obtained and used (in ordinary laboratory conditions) withina few seconds to minimize contamination.

This is shown by some studies, the authors of which havefound high percentages of researchers who falsify their CV or manipulatedata. We analyze the system used to evaluate science and researchers,which is almost exclusively based on the impact factor. We review themain critiques on the inappropriate use of the impact factor to assessresearchers and argue that this has generated a new style of thinking inwhich the only goal is to obtain publications with an impact factor.Over the last few years, the pressure to publish has led to an obsessionamong researchers to disseminate the multiple indicators of theirscientific publications over the Internet, to the extent that suchinitiatives look like marketing campaigns where researchers advertisethemselves. For all these reasons, we propose that this may be a newpsychological disorder, given that several criteria indicatingmaladaptation are clearly met: falsification and/or manipulation ofdata, falsification of publication indicators, distortion of reality,belief in manipulated data, and an obsession to conduct marketingcampaigns of oneself. We address the important ethical and legalimplications of such falsifications. Finally, we discuss the need tochange the system used to evaluate science and researchers, whichundoubtedly promotes these dishonest behaviors or this psychologicaldysfunction.

With the present study we aimto investigate whether these differences represent idiosyncraticvariations or whether they can be clustered into distinct facialactivity patterns.MethodsFacial actions during heat pain were assessed in two samples ofpain-free individuals (n=128; n=112) and were later analysed using theFacial Action Coding System. Hierarchical cluster analyses were used tolook for combinations of single facial actions in episodes of pain. Thestability/replicability of facial activity patterns was determinedacross samples as well as across different basic social situations.ResultsCluster analyses revealed four distinct activity patterns duringpain, which stably occurred across samples and situations: (I) narrowedeyes with furrowed brows and wrinkled nose; (II) opened mouth withnarrowed eyes; (III) raised eyebrows; and (IV) furrowed brows withnarrowed eyes. In addition, a considerable number of participants werefacially completely unresponsive during pain induction (stoic cluster).These activity patterns seem to be reaction stereotypies in the majorityof individuals (in nearly two-thirds), whereas a minority displayedvarying clusters across situations.ConclusionThese findings suggest that there is no uniform set of facialactions but instead there are at least four different facial activitypatterns occurring during pain that are composed of differentconfigurations of facial actions.

It is thus crucial to carefully considerstakeholder engagement strategies in adaptation interventions.PolicyrelevanceWhile adaptation is now firmly on the policy and researchagenda, actual interventions to reduce vulnerability and enhanceresilience remain in their infancy, and there is limited information onthe factors that influence the successful implementation of adaptationin developing areas. Engaging stakeholders in assessing vulnerabilityand implementing adaptation interventions is widely regarded to be animportant factor for adaptation implementation and success. However, nostudy has evaluated the effects of stakeholder engagement in the actualimplementation of adaptation initiatives. Effective stakeholderengagement is challenging, especially in a developing nation setting,due to high levels of poverty, inadequate knowledge on adaptationoptions, weak institutions, and competing interests to address moreimmediate problems related to poverty and underdevelopment.

(2009) investigated the ability ofpigs (Sus scrofa) to use a mirror to locate a hidden food source. Themirror-experienced pigs appeared to be able to bypass a solid barrierthat blocked direct view of a food bowl when the food bowl could be seenvia a mirror. We tried to replicate these findings using 2 groups of 11piglets each. The procedure used for testing the first group of 11 pigsfollowed Broom's description as closely as possible. Only two of thepigs of the first group were able to locate the hidden food bowl duringthe mirror test. Therefore, measures were taken to increase the numberof pigs noticing the mirror in the second group of 11 pigs. Now,although pigs notice the mirror significantly earlier, only 1 of themirror-experienced pigs and none of the mirror-naive pigs used thedetour around the partition wall to reach the hidden food.

Several reasons for thesefailures have been proposed, the most notable being questionableresearch practices and data fraud. We examine replication from adifferent perspective and illustrate that current intuitive expectationsfor replication are unreasonable. We used computer simulations to createthousands of ideal replications, with the same participants, wherein theonly difference across replications was random measurement error. In thefirst set of simulations, study results differed substantially acrossreplications as a result of measurement error alone. This raisesquestions about how researchers should interpret failed replicationattempts, given the large impact that even modest amounts of measurementerror can have on observed associations. In the second set ofsimulations, we illustrated the difficulties that researchers face whentrying to interpret and replicate a published finding. We also assessedthe relative importance of both sampling error and measurement error inproducing variability in replications. Conventionally, replicationattempts are viewed through the lens of verifying or falsifyingpublished findings. We suggest that this is a flawed perspective andthat researchers should adjust their expectations concerningreplications and shift to a meta-analytic mind-set."," 12"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 12"," 1745-6916"," WOS:000335827700006",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

As a potential remedy, we introduce safeguardpower analysis, which uses the uncertainty in the estimate of the effectsize to achieve a better likelihood of correctly identifying thepopulation effect size. Using a lower-bound estimate of the effect size,in turn, allows researchers to calculate a sample size for a replicationstudy that helps protect it from being underpowered.

The methodology builds overthe return of experience from past events and tries to clearly identifyall the stages of an evacuation and the thinking process that can leadto a robust evacuation plan. It relies on a conceptual framework -SADT-which helps to understand how data should be processed from itscollection to its use in the plan.

The methodology is supported bythe OSIRIS software, prototyped during the FP5 eponymous project andlater distributed by CETMEF and the French basin authorities of Loireand Meuse.The methodology for the preparation of evacuation plans was applied on apilot city of Theseus, Bordeaux on the estuary of Gironde (France), andthe software used to calculate evacuation times was tried out onCesenatico near the Adriatic coast (Italy). This comparison verified thereplicability of methodological guidelines in two different Europeancontexts. The cultural and organizational differences and the differentnumber of people involved underlined strong questions to be addressedwhen applying them. In order to assess the efficiency of an evacuationstrategy and to compute the number of people successfully evacuated overtime, a macroscopic model (not representing each individual vehicle butonly flows of vehicles in congestion points) for the simulation oftraffic congestion was used, based on the work of the University ofTwente, Rijkswaterstaat and INFRAM.

We performed 10 trials of 2-fold cross-validation ofexhaustive bivariate analysis on seven Wellcome-Trust Case-ControlConsortium GWAS datasets, comparing the traditional chi(2) test forassociation, the high-performance GBOOST method and the recentlyproposed GSS statistic (Available athttp://bioinformatics.research.nicta.com.au/software/gwis/). We useSpearman's correlation to measure the similarity between the folds ofcross validation. To compare incomplete lists of ranks we propose anextension to Spearman's correlation. The extension allows us to considera natural threshold for feature selection where the correlation is zero.This is the first reported cross-validation study of exhaustivebivariate GWAS feature selection. We found that stability between rankedlists from different cross-validation folds was higher for GSS in themajority of diseases. A thorough analysis of the correlation betweenSNP-frequency and univariate chi(2) score demonstrated that the chi(2)test for association is highly confounded by main effects: SNPs withhigh univariate significance replicably dominate the ranked results. Weshow that removal of the univariately significant SNPs improves chi(2)replicability but risks filtering pairs involving SNPs with univariateeffects. We empirically confirm that the stability of GSS and GBOOSTwere not affected by removal of univariately significant SNPs.

The present study sought to (1) inform currentdebates regarding the role of boldness in the definition of psychopathyand (2) clarify boundaries between psychopathy and antisocialpersonality disorder (ASPD).Method This study evaluated the degree to which facets of the triarchicmodel are represented in the most widely used clinical inventory forpsychopathy, the Psychopathy Checklist - Revised (PCL-R), in comparisonwith ASPD as defined by DSM-IV criteria. Adult male offenders from twodistinct correctional settings (n=157 and 169) were investigated toensure replicability of findings across samples exhibiting high baserates of psychopathy and antisocial behavior.Results We found evidence for convergent and discriminant validity ofthe three triarchic facets in predicting symptomatic components ofpsychopathy as assessed by the PCL-R.

In recent years they have invested in IPTV platforms andlaunched their own IPTV services. This has brought a new question on theregulatory agenda: shall network operators be obliged to offer wholesaleaccess to their IPTV platform? And if yes, should the new wholesale IPTVproduct be regulated in the same way as traditional wholesale access? Orshould traditional regulation be modified? While the majority ofcountries have so far no regulatory rules in place, some nationalregulators have started to become active in this market segment.In order for alternative network operators to realise multiple playoffers including IPTV they must be able to match the offers of theincumbent operators. Such replicability with respect to telecomsinfrastructure is in principle no problem as long as regulatory rules onlocal loop unbundling and related facilities are in place. But what ifincumbent operators are neither required to offer unbundled access totheir FTTH local loops nor do alternative network operators have accessto sub-loop unbundling? It is for this reason that many argue some formof direct access to the incumbent multicast equipment needs to beprovided. Otherwise the provision of IPTV services will be restricted tolarge network operators.The paper demonstrates that the regulation of wholesale access to IPTVdepends above all on country specific conditions. Ex-ante regulation ofaccess to wholesale broadband services over any DSL technology and anytransport technology (ATM and Ethernet) in the sense that the SMPoperator is obliged to offer a multicast functionality that allowscompetitors to offer TV services should be bound to a number ofrequirements: (1) the demand characteristics such as demand for bundledproducts. A precondition for determining regulatory obligations withrespect to the provision of wholesale access to IPTV platforms should bethat multiple play offers are the dominant form of providing telecomservices. (2) The lack of cable TV operators exerting competitivepressure at the retail level for triple play products. (3) A lack of LLUin the country, so that alternative operators need a multicast WBAaccess to offer multiple play services.The paper is organised as follows. The first section of the paperbriefly describes the technical and market characteristics of wholesaleIPTV access. The second section considers the impact of IPTV wholesaleaccess regulation on competition, investment and broadband diffusion.The third section examines regulatory issues concerning access towholesale IPTV in more detail. The final section gives keyrecommendations for a regulatory strategy on wholesale broadband accessto IPTV. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this randomized controlled trial, we are assessingthe efficacy of a complex, preventive intervention in reducing theincidence of, and costs associated with, the development of medicallyserious pressure ulcers in people with spinal cord injury.MethodsIndividuals with spinal cord injury recruited from RLANRC were assignedto either a 12-month preventive intervention group or a standard carecontrol group. The primary outcome is the incidence of serious pressureulcers with secondary endpoints including ulcer-related surgeries,medical treatment costs, and quality of life. These outcomes areassessed at 12 and 24 months after randomization. Additionally, we arestudying the mediating mechanisms that account for interventionoutcomes.ResultsPUPS has been successfully implemented, including recruitment of thetarget sample size of 170 participants, assurance of the integrity ofintervention protocol delivery with an average 90% treatment adherencerate, and enactment of the assessment plan. However, implementation hasbeen replete with challenges. To meet recruitment goals, we instituted afive-pronged approach customized for an underserved, ethnically diversepopulation. In intervention delivery, we increased staff time toovercome economic and cultural barriers to retention and adherence. Toensure treatment fidelity and replicability, we monitored interventionprotocol delivery in accordance with a rigorous plan. Finally, we haveovercome unanticipated assessment and design concerns related to (1)determining pressure ulcer incidence/severity, (2) randomizationimbalance, and (3) inadvertent potential control group contamination.LimitationsWe have addressed the most daunting challenges encountered in therecruitment, assessment, and intervention phases of PUPS.

Understanding theinterplay between genotype, phenotype and environment is necessary tomake accurate predictions of important biological outcomes such asstress resistance or yield in economically important plants and animals,and disease in humans. Based on population frequency patterns andfootprints of selection at the DNA level, the transposable elementBari-Jheh, inserted in the intergenic region of Juvenile Hormone EpoxyHydrolase (Jheh) genes, was previously identified as putativelyadaptive. However, the adaptive effect of this mutation remainedelusive. In this work, we integrate information on transcription factorbinding sites, available ChIP-Seq data, gene expression analyses andphenotypic assays to identify the functional and the mechanisticunderpinnings of Bari-Jheh. We show that Bari-Jheh adds extraantioxidant response elements upstream of Jheh1 and Jheh2 genes.Accordingly, we find that Bari-Jheh is associated with upregulation ofJheh1 and Jheh2 and with resistance to oxidative stress induced by twodifferent compounds relevant for natural D.melanogaster populations. Wefurther show that TEs other than Bari-Jheh might be playing a role inthe D.melanogaster response to oxidative stress. Overall our resultscontribute to the understanding of resistance to oxidative stress innatural populations and highlight the role of transposable elements inenvironmental adaptation.

At the same time, firms needto retain exclusive control over some essential components to capturevalue from their product and/or service system. This paper contributesto the literature by analyzing some of the trade-offs between opennessto external value creation and closedness for internal value capture. Itfocuses on selective openness as a key variable and investigates how itaffects value creation by external complementors, specifically themembers of user innovation communities. Openness, it is hypothesized,matters to community members: The more open a product design is, thehigher their sense of involvement in the innovation project, and thelarger the effort they devote to it. Unlike prior literature, differentforms and loci of openness are distinguished, specifically thetransparency, accessibility, and replicability of different componentsof the product being developed. Hypotheses are tested based on surveydata (n=309) from 20 online communities in the consumer electronics andinformation technology hardware industries. Multilevel regressionanalysis is used to account for clustering, and thus nonindependentdata, at the community level. We find that openness indeed increasescommunity members' involvement in the innovation project and theircontributions to it. Interestingly, however, some forms and loci ofopenness strongly affect community perceptions and behavior, whileothers have limited or no impact. This finding suggests that, at leastin relation to user communities, the trade-off that firms face betweenexternal value creation and internal value capture is softer thanhitherto understood. Contingency factors that may be able to explainthese patterns are advanced. For example, users are expected to valuethe form of openness that they have the capabilities and incentives toexploit. The findings in this paper extend the literature on selectiveopenness in innovation. They emphasize the need to study the demand fordifferent forms of openness at the subsystem level and align supply-sidestrategies to it. In managerial practice, a careful assessment of thedemand for openness enables firms to successfully use selective opennessand to effectively appropriate value from selectively open systems."," 1"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 1"," 0737-6782"," WOS:000331129100015",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There is considerable experience,however, with objective gait analysis in other species, such as horsesand dogs. In this study, a pressure mat was used to establish baselinekinetic data for gait and its longitudinal development in growing,weaned piglets.Ten clinically healthy weaned piglets were trained to trot over apressure mat. Measurements were performed weekly during 10 weeks,starting at 5 weeks of age. Four kinetic parameters were recorded forall four limbs: peak vertical force (PVF), load rate (LR), verticalimpulse (VI) and peak vertical pressure (PVP). Three representative runsper measuring session per pig were collected. For each of the variables,left vs. right limb asymmetry-indices (ASI's) were calculated based onthe average for that parameter per week. A linear mixed model was usedto determine the influence of time (week), velocity, and limb (left vs.right, and fore vs. hind). Intra-class correlations were calculated toassess within-session replicability.Results: Intra-class correlations showed good within-sessionreplicability. Body-weight normalized PVF (nPVF), LR (nLR), VI (nVI) andPVP (nPVP) were higher in the forelimbs than in the hind limbs. A highervelocity was associated with a higher nPVF, nLR and nPVP. All parametersvaried between weeks. ASI of LR and VI were higher in the forelimbs thanin the hind limbs. Velocity and time did not influence ASI of any of thevariables.Conclusions: Kinetic pressure mat measurements from healthy weanedpiglets are highly replicable within-session. However, these variablespresent a significant variability between-session, which may be due toconformational changes of the young, growing piglets.

Participants inthe AMP + FACT group experienced greater reductions in social anxietysymptoms than both active (n = 40) and control (n = 39) groups reportedby Carlbring et al., and did not differ in symptom reductions from theiCBT group. Higher attention bias predicted greater symptom reductionsfor participants who completed AMP, but not for the control group.Moreover, change in attention bias mediated the relationship between AMPgroup (active condition reported by Carlbring et al. versus AMP + FACT)and change in social anxiety symptoms.

In this study, viral infection potential, replication kinetics,and pathogenicity were compared. The solid-phase binding assaydemonstrated that both viruses prominently maintained a preference forthe human-type receptor and the reassortant A/swine/Jilin/37/2008(Sw/JL/37/08) showed relatively higher binding affinities than thenon-reassortant A/swine/Jilin/19/2007 (Sw/JL/19/07). Replicationkinetics showed that Sw/JL/37/08 had higher replicability in MDCK cellsthan Sw/JL/19/07. The mouse experiments clearly revealed thatSw/JL/37/08 had higher virulence than Sw/JL/19/07 as measured by moresignificant body weight loss, higher viral lung load, delayed viralclearance from lungs, and more severe pulmonary lesions. Sequenceanalysis indicated that the absence of glycosylation sites at residue126 of HA and 93 of NA, as well as the characteristic NS1 C-terminal PLresidues of ESEV may account for the increased replication andpathogenicity of Sw/JL/37/08.

But it is likely to behard to discuss popularity in classical Chinese literature, since theconcept has not been developed yet. In premodern period, as literaryworks were in most cases composed in a literary style with poeticrhymes, it was nearly impossible that they gained popularity among theordinary people. Furthermore, as intellectuals attached greaterimportance to the study of Yi(義) and Li(理), and the realization of theConfucian ideology, the literary works that pursued rhetoricalembellishments and the preparation for state examination were consideredlow and degrading. Thus, the works that depicted the life of the commonpeople in detail or expressed one’s personal sentiment could only beestimated properly when they were related to the study of Yi and Li. Butin late Joseon period, as the intellectual class began to be dividedinto several groups, poor scholars who shared daily life with ordinarypeople endeavored to write without hierarchical and political notion.They were neither scholars with official post who were in charge ofnational documents, nor tasteful writers who belonged to literarysocieties. Their works can be estimated to be popular compared to thosecomposed by intellectuals that give priority to the literature of managestate affairs(經國文章) and the literature of decoration of nation(華國文章).But it is also possible to say that their works have pure literarycharacteristics in their own way. They introduced irregular hanmun intheir works which was widely spread in the daily life, while at the sametime using expressions of traditional written language. In this articlethe popularity in classical Chinese literature in late Josen period wassurveyed in three aspects; ⓐhaving close connection to daily life ofordinary people, without hierarchical and political notion oftraditional literature. ⓑintroducing irregular hanmun escaping from theold styled written hanmun. ⓒadapting poetic hanmun without rhymes,escaping from the regular style of poetic rhyme. The popularity emergedin late Josen period is different from the modern concept of popularitythat is connected to commercialism, replicability and crudity.

Neither short-termhumanitarian aid nor traditional development financing are well adaptedfor such environments. Multi-donor trust funds, in their current form,can be unwieldy and subject to long delays in initiation and work bestwhen national governments are already strong. We reviewed the aidmodalities used in Zimbabwe through the period of crisis, 2008-2012 andtheir results and implications. Literature review and case experiencewas utilised. Discussion: By focusing on working with line ministries innon-contested sectors to determine local priorities rather thanfollowing global prescriptions, pooling funds to achieve scale ratherthan delivering through fragmented projects, and building on nationalsystems and capacities rather than setting up parallel mechanisms, theTransition Fund Model employed in Zimbabwe by UNICEF and partners inpartnership with the Inclusive Government was able to achieve importantresults in health, education, social support and water services in achallenging setting. In addition, forums for collaboration weredeveloped that provided a platform for further action. The initialemphasis on service delivery diffused much of the political delicatenessthat impeded progress in other sectors.

Methods A knownconcentration of methylene blue was collected in standards after thecolorimetric solid-phase extraction. An aqueous solution containing aknown concentration of methylene blue was collected by the solid-phasecolorimetric extraction method. A known concentration of methylene bluewith 1% acetic acid and methanol solution was collected by directcolorimetric method. Three sets of numerical data were compared toinvestigate the effects of methylene blue in the operation of thesolid-phase extraction. Results Using the colorimetric method, 1 to 5mumoL/L of 1% methylene blue acetate methanol solution was directlycompared by the differences in color. Then , a solution containing 1 to5 mumoL/L methylene blue solution, a solution containing 1 to 5 mumoL/Lmethylene blue plasma obtained through the Waters Oasis HLB columnsolid-phase extraction, and a methanol solution containing 1 % aceticacid were compared with a colorimetric spectrophotometer. The resultswere compared to methylene blue at 92. 9% of the extraction rate. Thelinearity was satis-factory. Conclusion Using the solid-phase extractionspectrophotometer method to detect methylene blue, the methylenebluecontent had a favorable recovery rate and replicability. Hence,theCentral Asian's routine quality control method is effective and feasibleto detect the methylene blue content in virus-inactivated plasma. Thedissolution of methylene blue in plasma after extraction or in distilledwater/1 % acetic acid and methanol resulted in the same concentration ofmethylene blue. The values of methylene blue were close to the matchingT-test value of 0.010 2,with P <0. 05,indicating that there was nostatistically significant difference between the two values.

I considerthree persistent influences of The lake as a Microcosm: as an organizingparadigm for the teaching of limnology relative to its practice; theidea that inland waters are like islands, and the replicability of typesof inland waters. Based on inspection of recent peer-reviewed literatureand 32 limnology texts, we teach limnology according to Forbes but donot practice it in that holistic context. Instead, we practice limnologyas aquatic ecology. Based on novel analyses of species-arearelationships for 275 inland waters and 392 islands, inland waters aremore like continental habitat patches than islands; the island metaphoris poetic but not accurate. Based on a quantitative review of betadiversity (40 data sets representing 10,576 inland waters and 26 datasets representing 1529 terrestrial sites), aquatic systems are no morereplicable than are terrestrial systems; a typological approach tolimnology is no more justified than it is in terrestrial systems.I conclude that a former distinction between limnology and aquaticecology no longer applies, and that we should define limnology as theecology of inland waters. Also, we should not consider lakes and riversas islands that represent other systems of the same type, but shouldconsider them as open, interactive habitat patches that vary accordingto their geology and biogeography. I suggest modern limnology operatesaccording to 3 paradigms, which combine to form 3 broad limnologicaldisciplines and establish a basis for a plural, interactive view oflakes and rivers as microcosms.

In thatthesis, I examined the non-delegation doctrine based on due-processprinciple. To achieve it, I considered it from three points of view:substantial due-process under which a delegation is not proper unlessthe legislature impose substantial restriction on agencies discretionenough to guarantee that such discretion is not limitless; structuraldue-process under which the person incurring damages from the act ofagencies will be given an opportunity to have courts' judicial review onconstitutionality of such delegation; and procedural due-process underwhich governmental agencies exercise their legislative rights bysupplementing legitimacy through deliberation and participation. Underthe structural due-process, in this paper, I put the judicial branch,monitoring legitimacy of delegation, and the executive branch,requesting for judicial deference to their interpretation, in equalposition. And then, based on the assumption that the structure of theConstitution itself where a judicial review is to be expected justifieslegislative delegation, I explore who is the best institution tointerpret, that is to say, what competence is required, or who has thecompetence like that. For this, I introduce the Institutional Terntheory under which dogmatism and formalism of jurisprudence arecriticized and the law must become reflexive and bottom-up. In spite oftheir differences, most of supporters of the theory assert that thejudicial branch should defer to the interpretation of the executivebecause of its competence as responsibility and expertise. Depending onthe type of public interest the social community desires to have, thelegacy of legislation and its implementation would be the form of eitherindustrial regulation and environment-friendly or industrialderegulation and environmental development. In terms of this, in thispaper, I state my view that the role of courts is to strike balance ofthem and the values of legal system of the followings should beconsidered as standards to be applied by the courts at the moment:predictability; replicability; systemic consistency; responsiveness;justice; fairness; doctrinal stability; social congruence; social valueformation, and so on. In doing so, we can recognize that theconsideration of institutional competence and value of legal system isposted in the course of balancing between the judicial branch andexecutive branch as per changes in social and environmental context,since they go along with the history of justification model ofadministrative state."," 0"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 1226-301X"," KJD:ART001883311",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA," 행정입법의 해석주체― 구조적 듀ㆍ프로세스 관점에서의 위임금지법리의 재해석 ―"," 공법연구"," 미국의 입법권 위임금지법리가 오늘날 행정국가화 현상과 더불어 변용되어 이제는 듀ㆍ프로세스를 통해 행정법상에서 찾아볼 수 있게되었다. 학위 논문에서는 이러한 듀ㆍ프로세스법리를 세 가지 관점으로 나누어 살펴보고 있다. 즉, 의회는 행정기관의 재량이 무제한인것은 아님을 보증하기에 충분한 실체적인 제약을 두지 않으면 위임이 적절한 것으로서 인정되지 않는다고 하는 실체적 듀ㆍ프로세스,위임시에는 행정기관의 입법담당자에게는 중요한 정치적 책임이 동반되기 때문에 행정기관의 행위로 피해를 입은 경우에는 사법심사를 통해그 위임의 합헌성을 심사받을 기회가 주어진다고 하는 의미에서의 구조적 듀ㆍ프로세스, 마지막으로 행정기관이 숙고와 참여로 정당성을보완하는 절차를 통해 그 입법권을 행사한다고 하는 절차적 듀ㆍ프로세스라는 3가지로 나누어 현대행정국가에 있어서의 위임금지법리의의미를 재검토하고자 했다. 이글은 그중에서도 구조적 듀ㆍ프로세스에서는 사법심사가 예정되어 있다고 하는 헌법구조 그 자체가 행정에입법권을 위임하는 것을 정당화한다고 하는 구조를 전제로 그 통제의 주체인 사법부와 사법부에 겸양을 요구하는 행정부를 동등하게두고, 해석의 적임자는 누구인가, 즉 해석에 있어서의 각 부문(제도)의 적성을 고찰했다. 이를 위해, 사법의 도그마티즘이나형식주의를 비판하여 법은 응답적이고 보텀ㆍ업적인 것이지 않으면 안된다고 하는 제도전회론을 소개하고 있다. 제도전회론의 지지자들은조금씩 차이는 있지만 오늘날 행정부의 책임성과 전문성이라는 제도적성을 판단기준으로 할 때, 사법은 행정의 해석에 겸양하지 않으면안된다고 하는 것을 주장의 요지로 하고 있다. 입법과 그 집행의 결과는 그 사회공동체가 바라고 있는 공익은 어떤 것인가에 의해산업규제강화나 친환경적인 형태로 나타나는 것도, 산업규제완화나 환경개발적인 형태로 나타나는 것도 가능할 것이다. 이에 대해서는어떤 일방으로 치우치지 않도록 양방향의 균형을 맞추는 것이 법원의 역할이고, 그 기준으로서 제도의 적성에 못지않게 예견가능성,반복가능성, 일관성, 응답성, 공정성, 공평성, 안정성, 사회의 조화, 사회적 가치의 형성과 같은 법시스템 그 자체가 가지고 있는가치가 고려되지 않으면 안된다고 하는 논의를 소개했다. 다만, 제도적성과 법시스템적 가치의 고려는 행정국가의 정당화모델의 역사와그 흐름을 함께하고 있다는 점에서 사회문맥과 환경의 변화에 따른 사법부와 행정부의 균형잡기과정에서 행해지고 있음을 알 수 있고,해석의 주도권을 어디에 갖게 할 것인가는 그 사회의 수준과 놓여져 있는 상황에 따라 판단되어야 할 것이다.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

TheStandards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture(STRICTA) is a reporting guideline for key elements of acupunctureinterventions in clinical trials. This study used STRICTA to investigatewhether Cochrane reviews of acupuncture adequately report importanttreatment details.Design: Systematic review Methods: Cochrane reviews of acupuncture wereidentified from The Cochrane Library (issue 7, 2012). Randomisedcontrolled trials (RCTs) included in the reviews and published after2005 were obtained. Using STRICTA, we extracted acupuncture-relatedinformation from the Cochrane reviews and the RCTs. The characteristicsof the included studies' table were the major source of interventioninformation from Cochrane reviews. Reporting quality of acupunctureinterventions in Cochrane reviews was assessed and compared with therespective RCTs.Results: 25 Cochrane reviews of acupuncture and 92 RCTs met theselection criteria. Cochrane reviews were 16% less likely to report theacupuncture-related items of STRICTA than RCTs (risk ratio 0.84, 95% CI0.79 to 0.88, I-2=8%). Information was significantly better reported for10 of the 15 treatment-group items of STRICTA in RCTs than in Cochranereviews (p<0.05), while four items did so without statisticalsignificance. One item related to practitioner background wassignificantly better reported in Cochrane reviews.Conclusions: Reporting quality of treatment details in Cochrane reviewsof acupuncture was insufficient with regard to STRICTA, even though suchinformation was readily reported in RCTs. The overall quality ofreporting of the RCTs, while better than the reviews, was also oftensuboptimal. Use of STRICTA guideline during the review process isrecommended to adequately report the key treatment components inCochrane reviews of acupuncture.

In the past 40 years, temperature in Siziwang Banner wasslowly increasing. The precipitation and storms were fluctuatinggreatly, but the long-term trend did not change much though mostherdsmen reported that the rainfall was significantly decreasing. Recentyears of extreme climate events impressed herdsmen most. As to theimpacts of extreme climate events, drought was most impressive toherders followed by snowstorms and sandstorms. For adapting to climatechange herdsmen had spontaneously taken various adaptive measures, ofwhich 22 adaptation measures were reported in the survey. The top fivemeasures that were used by most herdsmen are storing more hay andforage, reducing the herd size, building warm shed, borrowing money(loan), and not let next generations be herders. Others include buildingcorral, digging well, planting fodder, cooperation in vaccinations ofcattle, reducing household expenditures, changing grazing location,renting grassland, introducing new breeds, savings, wage labor, givingup herding, alternative livelihoods (e.g. tourism), sharing herdingarrangement, etc. The 22 spontaneous adaptation measures were assessedby experts with the method of multiple criteria analysis (MCA). Thecriteria include effectiveness, economic benefits, flexibility,no-regret, side-effect, compliance with government policies and plans,compatibility with development goals, and replicability. The resultsshowed that building warm shed, the introduction of new breeds, hay andforage storage, reducing the herd size and wage labor met the mostcriteria. The spontaneous adaptation measures were further screened byherdsmen, researchers, and local government officials with theparticipatory method. The results showed that measures such as buildingwarm shed, introduction of new breeds, hay and forage storage, reducingthe herd size and loan were more effective than others, which did nottotally coincide with the results of expert assessment. To support thespontaneous adaptation measures which were selected to be most practicaland effective, the herders identified the following policies that weremostly needed, i.e. loan support, the improvement of social security,accurate weather forecasts and pest forecasts, animal insurance,training, market access enhancement, enhancement of infrastructure, warmshed subsidies and drinking water project. Those policies would improveherdsmens ability of adapting to climate change, help herdsmen to copewith extreme climate events, and reduce their vulnerability oflivelihoods."," 0"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 1000-3037"," CSCD:5058833",NA,NA,NA,NA," 1000-3037(2014)29:2<211:MHDQHB>2.0.TX;2-O",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA," 牧户对气候变化的感知与适应--以内蒙古四子王旗查干补力格苏木为例",NA,NA,NA," 靳乐山魏同洋胡振通"," 自然资源学报"," 通过在内蒙古自治区四子王旗查干补力格苏木的实地调查，并对四子王旗气象数据与调研得到的牧户感知数据进行对比分析，结果表明：牧民对气温变化的感知较对降水变化的感知准确度高，对风沙的感知与实际差距较大。在灾害造成的影响感知方面，牧户对干旱造成的影响感知最为深刻。牧户为适应气候变化已自主采取了多种应对措施，在实地调研中识别出至少22种自主适应措施，采用较多的适应措施是多储备草料、减少牲畜存栏、建暖棚、借款和不让后代养羊，其中最重要的适应措施是多储备草料。自主适应行为的评估和筛选结果显示：多储备草料、建暖棚、减少牲畜存栏、引进新品种、借贷款、外出打工是牧民认为较好的自主适应措施。与之相配套的政策需求为：贷款支持、青贮窖补贴、暖棚补贴、更精确的天气预报和病虫害预报、牧业保险、新品种的技术培训、新品种的市场对接、职业技能培训、完善的社会保障体系等。这些政策可以增强牧民适应气候变化的能力，同时减缓牧民生计脆弱性。",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There is considerable experience,however, with objective gait analysis in other species, such as horsesand dogs. In this study, a pressure mat was used to establish baselinekinetic data for gait and its longitudinal development in growing,weaned piglets. Ten clinically healthy weaned piglets were trained totrot over a pressure mat. Measurements were performed weekly during 10weeks, starting at 5 weeks of age. Four kinetic parameters were recordedfor all four limbs: peak vertical force (PVF), load rate (LR), verticalimpulse (VI) and peak vertical pressure (PVP). Three representative runsper measuring session per pig were collected. For each of the variables,left vs. right limb asymmetry-indices (ASI's) were calculated based onthe average for that parameter per week. A linear mixed model was usedto determine the influence of time (week), velocity, and limb (left vs.right, and fore vs. hind). Intra-class correlations were calculated toassess within-session replicability. Results: Intra-class correlationsshowed good within-session replicability. Body-weight normalized PVF(nPVF), LR (nLR), VI (nVI) and PVP (nPVP) were higher in the forelimbsthan in the hind limbs. A higher velocity was associated with a highernPVF, nLR and nPVP. All parameters varied between weeks. ASI of LR andVI were higher in the forelimbs than in the hind limbs. Velocity andtime did not influence ASI of any of the variables. Conclusions: Kineticpressure mat measurements from healthy weaned piglets are highlyreplicable within-session. However, these variables present asignificant variability between-session, which may be due toconformational changes of the young, growing piglets. Velocity clearlyinfluences nPVF, nLR and nPVP, and all kinetic variables have highervalues in forelimbs than in hind limbs. As time and velocity do notaffect ASI's, the latter are preferable tools when velocity cannot becontrolled or when measurements are repeated over longer time intervals.The present study supports the use of a pressure mat as an objective wayto analyze and quantify porcine gait."," 0"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 1746-6148"," CABI:20143076408",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I argue that such expectations are misguided andinconsistent with evolutionary understandings of the brain as acomputational organ. Rather, we should expect priming effects to behighly sensitive to variations in experimental features and subjectpopulations. Such variation does not make priming effects frivolous orcapricious but instead can be predicted a priori. However, absenttheories specifying the precise contingencies that lead to suchvariation, failures to replicate another researcher's findings willnecessarily be ambiguous with respect to the inferences that can bemade. Priming research is not yet at the stage where such theoriesexist, and therefore failures are uninformative at the current time.Ultimately, priming researchers themselves must provide directreplications of their own effects; researchers have been deficient inmeeting this responsibility and have contributed to the current state ofconfusion.

As a consequence, a replicated phenomenon may notserve as a rigorous test of a theoretical hypothesis because identicaloperationalizations of variables in studies conducted at different timesand with different subject populations might test different theoreticalconstructs.

Bias was determinedusing the Intralipid simulated lipemic samples. Furthermore, we aimed tocompare obtained data with the manufacturers' claims and desirablespecification for imprecision derived from biological variation.Results: i) Manufacturers' declarations were not confirmed for all threemanufacturers; ii) the magnitude and direction of the effect of lipemiaon laboratory results differ substantially between the three testedanalytical systems; and iii) manufacturers are using arbitrary limits indeclaring the expected effect of interference on laboratory results.Conclusions: There is an urgent need to standardize the waymanufacturers test and report their data on the lipemia interference.

Nonetheless, an increase inthe transgene carrying capacity of these Ad vectors, currently limitedto approximately 3000 base pairs, would greatly enhance their utility.Using a replicating, E3-deleted Ad type 5 host range mutant (Ad5 hr)encoding full-length single-chain HIV(BaL)gp120 linked to the D1 and D2domains of rhesus macaque CD4 (rhFLSC) we systematically deleted thegenes encoding early region 4 open reading frame 1 (E4orf1) throughE4orf4. All the Ad-rhFLSC vectors produced similar levels of viralprogeny. Cell cycle analysis of infected human and monkey cells revealedno differences in virus-host interaction. The parental and E4-deletedviruses expressed comparable levels of the transgene with kineticssimilar to Ad late proteins. Similar levels of cellular immune responsesand transgene-specific antibodies were elicited in vaccinated mice.However, differences in recognition of Ad proteins and induced antibodysubtypes were observed, suggesting that the E4 gene products mightmodulate antibody responses by as yet unknown mechanisms. In short, wehave improved the transgene carrying capacity by one thousand base pairswhile preserving the replicability, levels of transgene expression, andimmunogenicity critical to these vaccine vectors. This additional spaceallows for flexibility in vaccine design that could not be obtained withthe current vector and as such should facilitate the goal of improvingvaccine efficacy.

There is an unacceptable delay in the diagnosis of axialspondyloarthritis (axSpA) in its early stages among patients at highrisk, in particular those with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Ourobjectives were to develop a sensible and reliable questionnaire toidentify undetected axSpA among patients with IBD.Methods. Literature was reviewed for item generation in the TorontoaxSpA Questionnaire on IBD (TASQ-IBD). Sensibility of the questionnairewas assessed among healthcare professionals and patients. Thisassessment was related to purpose and framework (clinical function,clinical justification, and clinical applicability), face validity,comprehensiveness [oligo-variability (limiting the questionnaire toimportant items) and transparency], replicability, content validity, andfeasibility. The test-retest reliability study was administered to 77patients with established IBD and axSpA. Kappa agreement coefficientsand absolute agreement were calculated for items.Results. Three domains included IBD, inflammatory back symptoms, andextraaxial features. The entry criterion required a patient to have IBDand back pain or stiffness that ever persisted for >= 3 months.Iterative sensibility assessment involved 16 items and a diagram of theback. Kappa coefficients ranged from 0.81-1.00 for each item. Absoluteagreement across all items ranged from 91% to 100%.Conclusion. TASQ-IBD is a newly developed, sensible, and reliablecase-finding questionnaire to be administered to patients with IBD whohave ever had chronic back pain or stiffness persisting for >= 3 months.It should facilitate identification and timely referral of patients withIBD to rheumatologists and minimize the delay in diagnosis of axSpA.Consequently, it should assess the prevalence of axSpA in IBD."," 1"," 1"," 0"," 0"," 1"," 0315-162X"," WOS:000326668900014",NA,NA," 23996291",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Appraisal status targets may be sustainability,compliance with a standard (such as the UN code of conduct forresponsible fisheries) or the degree of progress in meeting some othergoal or target. The method combines semi-quantitative (e.g. ecological)and qualitative (e.g. social) data via multiple evaluation fields, eachof which is assessed through scores assigned to six to 12 attributes orindicators: the scoring method allows user flexibility to adopt a widerange of utility relationships. For assessing sustainability, sixevaluation fields have been developed: ecological, technological,economic, social, ethical and institutional. Each field can be assesseddirectly with a set of scored attributes, or several of the fields canbe dealt with in greater detail using nested subfields that themselvescomprise multidimensional Rapfish assessments (e.g. the hierarchicalinstitutional field encompasses both governance and management,including a detailed analysis of legality). The user has the choice ofincluding all or only some of the available sustainability fields. Forthe attributes themselves, there will rarely be quantitative data, butscoring allows these items to be estimated. Indeed, within a normativeframework, one important advantage with Rapfish is transparency of therigour, quality and replicability of the scores. The Rapfish techniqueemploys a constrained multidimensional ordination that is scaled tosituate data points within evaluation space. Within each evaluationfield, results may be presented as a two-dimensional plot or in aone-dimensional rank order. Uncertainty is expressed through theprobability distribution of Monte-Carlo simulations that use the c.l. oneach original observation. Overall results of the multidisciplinaryanalysis may be shown using kite diagrams that compare differentlocations, time periods (including future projections) and managementscenarios, which make policy trade-offs explicit. These enhancements arenow available in the R programming language and on an open website,where users can run Rapfish analyses by downloading the software oruploading their data to a user interface.

Its three aspects each respond to significantchallenges: low-impact living and the challenge of post-carbon valuechange; affordability and the challenge of mutualism and equality; andcommunity and the challenge of self-governance. I conclude the articleby exploring six lessons from Lilac that tentatively outline a roadmaptowards post-carbon cities: the need for holistic approaches that dealwith complex challenges, prioritizing self-determination rather thanjust participation, engaging with productive political tensions,adopting a process rather than an outcomes-based approach, developingstrategy for replicability, and finally, embracing a non-parochialapproach to localities."," 3"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 3"," 0309-1317"," WOS:000323198200009",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The defaultmode network (DMN) is one of the most frequently studied resting-statenetworks. However, less is known about specific structural dependency orinteractions among brain regions within the DMN in AD. In this study, weperformed a Bayesian network (BN) analysis based on regional grey mattervolumes to identify differences in structural interactions among coreDMN regions in structural MRI data from 80 AD patients and 101 normalcontrols (NC). Compared to NC, the structural interactions between themedial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and other brain regions, including theleft inferior parietal cortex (IPC), the left inferior temporal cortex(ITC) and the right hippocampus (HP), were significantly reduced in theAD group. In addition, the AD group showed prominent increases instructural interactions from the left ITC to the left HP, the left HP tothe right ITC, the right HP to the right ITC, and the right IPC to theposterior cingulate cortex (PCC). The BN models significantlydistinguished AD patients from NC with 87.12% specificity and 81.25%sensitivity. We then used the derived BN models to examine thereplicability and stability of AD-associated BN models in an independentdataset and the results indicated discriminability with 83.64%specificity and 80.49% sensitivity. The results revealed that the BNanalysis was effective for characterising regional structureinteractions and the AD-related BN models could be considered as validand predictive structural brain biomarker models for AD. Therefore, ourstudy can assist in further understanding the pathological mechanism ofAD, based on the view of the structural network, and may provide newinsights into classification and clinical application in the study of ADin the future."," 2"," 2"," 0"," 0"," 2"," 1932-6203"," WOS:000323733800110",NA,NA," 24015315",NA," e74070"," Alzheimer's Dis Neuroimaging Initi",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There were nosignificant effects of mood (high BDI, low BDI) or judgment (estimation,production) on the mean exponent, n = .98, 95% confidence interval(.96-1.04) or on the threshold. However, the intercept showed a'depressive realism' effect, where high BDI participants had a smallerdeviation from accuracy and a smaller difference between estimation andjudgment than low BDI participants. Accuracy bias was assessed usingthree measures of accuracy: difference, defined as psychological timeminus physical time, ratio, defined as psychological time divided byphysical time, and a new logarithmic accuracy measure defined as In(ratio). The In (ratio) measure was shown to have approximately normalresiduals when subjected to a mixed ANOVA with mood as a between groupsexplanatory factor and judgment and time category as repeated measuresexplanatory factors.

We propose acommunity-based palliative care (CPC) model that spans the array ofinpatient and outpatient settings in which palliative care is providedand links seamlessly to inpatient care; likewise, it would span the fulltrajectory of advanced illness rather than focusing on the period justbefore death. Examples of CPC programs are developing organically acrossthe U.S. As our understanding of CPC expands, standardization is neededto ensure replicability, consistency, and the ability to relateintervention models to outcomes. A growing body of literature examiningoutpatient palliative care supports the role of CPC in improvingoutcomes, including reduction in symptom burden, improved quality oflife, increased survival, better satisfaction with care, and reducedhealth care resource utilization. Furthermore the examination of how tooperationalize CPC is needed before widespread implementation can berealized.

We found within-subject reliability of ICNswas modest overall, but ranged from poor to good, and that voxels withthe highest measured connectivity rarely had the highest reliability.Networks associated with executive functions, visuospatial reasoning,motor coordination, speech and audition, default mode, vision, andinteroception showed moderate to high group-level reproducibility andreplicability. However, only the first four of these networks alsoshowed fair or better within-subject reliability over time. Our findingshighlight the replicability of ICNs across data sets, the range ofwithin-subject neurometrics across different networks, and the sharedcharacteristics between resting and task-based networks.

Here, wereview the literature in which seasonal or circannual rhythms wereexamined under typical 12:12 h photoperiods and present our historicaldata of locomotor activity of male and female Sprague-Dawley rats acrossseveral seasons and years. In general, there was little evidence toindicate significant effects on the locomotor activity of rats or mice,while studies of depression behaviors were somewhat inconsistent intheir findings. Results of the few anxiety behavior assessments werefairly consistent, at least in rat studies. Two studies of pain-relatedbehaviors indicated decreased responses during spring or summer testing.If such seasonal effects are real, this would imply that laboratoryrodents have a type of internal Type 2 circannual clock or endogenousoscillator. However, photoperiod, temperature, or humidity cannot be thezeitgeber. Further, the need for a circannual clock in a short-livedrodent is debatable.

Results revealed that an entrepreneurship-pronepersonality profile is regionally clustered.

Unfortunately, the lack of arigorous software structuring can undermine the maintainability,communicability and replicability of the process. To ameliorate thisproblem we propose the Leaf system, the aim of which is to seamlesslyintroduce the pipeline formality on top of a dynamical developmentprocess with minimum overhead for the programmer, thus providing asimple layer of software structuring.Results: Leaf includes a formal language for the definition of pipelineswith code that can be transparently inserted into the user's Pythoncode. Its syntax is designed to visually highlight dependencies in thepipeline structure it defines. While encouraging the developer to thinkin terms of bioinformatic pipelines, Leaf supports a number of automatedfeatures including data and session persistence, consistency checksbetween steps of the analysis, processing optimization and publicationof the analytic protocol in the form of a hypertext.Conclusions: Leaf offers a powerful balance between plan-driven andchange-driven development environments in the design, management andcommunication of bioinformatic pipelines.

Studying the degree of sharing of disease-associatedvariants across populations can help in solving these issues. We presenta comprehensive survey of GWAS replicability across 28 diseases. Mostloci and SNPs discovered in Europeans for these conditions have beenextensively replicated using peoples of European and East Asianancestry, while the replication with individuals of African ancestry ismuch less common. We found a strong and significant correlation of OddsRatios across Europeans and East Asians, indicating that underlyingcausal variants are common and shared between the two ancestries.Moreover, SNPs that failed to replicate in East Asians map into genomicregions where Linkage Disequilibrium patterns differ significantlybetween populations. Finally, we observed that GWAS with larger samplesizes have detected variants with weaker effects rather than with lowerfrequencies. Our results indicate that most GWAS results are due tocommon variants.

To identify and hopefully avoid these errors in futurestudies, the articles in seven journals with the highest number of basicscience central nervous system TBI and SCI animal research studiespublished in 2010 (N = 125 articles) were reviewed for their dataanalysis procedures. After identifying the most common statisticalerrors, the implications of those findings were demonstrated byreanalyzing previously published data from our laboratories using theidentified inappropriate statistical procedures, then comparing the twosets of results. Overall, 70% of the articles contained at least onetype of inappropriate statistical procedure. The highest percentageinvolved incorrect post hoc t-tests (56.4%), followed by inappropriateparametric statistics (analysis of variance and t-test; 37.6%). RepeatedMeasures analysis was inappropriately missing in 52.0% of all articlesand, among those with behavioral assessments, 58% were analyzedincorrectly. Reanalysis of our published data using the most commoninappropriate statistical procedures resulted in a 14.1% averageincrease in significant effects compared to the original results.Specifically, an increase of 15.5% occurred with Independent t-tests and11.1% after incorrect post hoc t-tests. Utilizing proper statisticalprocedures can allow more-definitive conclusions, facilitatereplicability of research results, and enable more accurate translationof those results to the clinic."," 1"," 1"," 0"," 0"," 1"," 0897-7151"," WOS:000319336100001",NA,NA," 23186206",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The aim of this paper is to present a simple method forquantifying size and shape by applying parameters to quantify shape andto highlight preliminary results indicating that this method providesuseful data. Hypotheses tested were: common extensor origin sizecorrelates with humerus size; ECs change the size and shape of entheses;surface area is increased in those entheses with bony proliferation. Thecommon extensor origins of 43 male skeletons from medieval York wererecorded. The entheses were recorded visually for any deviation from asmooth surface. The chord was measured using sliding calipers and theshape of the entheses recorded using a profile gauge and quantifiedusing parameters (e.g. the standard deviation of the surface from a meanline) which assess the relationship of the surface to a flat surface. Totest replicability, disarticulated humeri were also recorded(inter-observer error n = 9; intra-observer error n = 20) using the samemethodology. Replicability for size and shape was good forintra-observer error but weaker for inter-observer error. There isvariability in enthesis size and distal humeral condyle size; normalentheses are smaller than those with EC while their surface shapediffers and is affected by the type of EC (proliferative ordestructive); surface area in those entheses with proliferative ECs isincreased. The use of these parameters for quantifying enthesis size andshape provides insights into enthesis variability which cannot be testedusing visual methods alone. These parameters can be recorded using thistwo-dimensional method or can be measured on data collected with a laserscanner.

The present study tests thereplicability of findings from an earlier study, and expands on thecriterion validity of cyclothymic disorder in youth. Using the Robinsand Guze (1970) framework we examined the validity of cyclothymicdisorder as a subtype of BP. Using a youth (ages 5-17) outpatientclinical sample (N = 894), participants with cyclothymic disorder (n =53) were compared to participants with other BP spectrum disorders (n =399) and to participants with non-bipolar disorders (n = 442). Analysestested differences in youth with cyclothymic disorder and bipolardisorder not otherwise specified who do, and those who do not, have aparent with BP. Compared to youth with non-bipolar disorders, youth withcyclothymic disorder had higher irritability (p < 0.001), morecomorbidity (p < 0.001), greater sleep disturbance (p < 0.005), and weremore likely to have a family history of BP (p < 0.001). Cyclothymicdisorder was associated with a younger age of onset compared todepression (p < 0.001) and bipolar II (p = 0.05). Parental BP status wasnot significantly associated with any variables. Results support thatcyclothymic disorder belongs on the bipolar spectrum. Epidemiologicalstudies indicate that cyclothymic disorder is not uncommon and involvessignificant impairment. Failing to differentiate between cyclothymicdisorder and bipolar NOS limits our knowledge about a significantproportion of cases of bipolarity."," 2"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 2"," 0091-0627"," WOS:000316398700002",NA,NA," 22968491",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In addition, recent data suggest that patientengagement and motivation are critical ingredients for effectiveself-management. This article carefully describes a self-managementintervention using motivational interviewing skills, aimed to increaseengagement and commitment in severe COPD patients.METHODS: The intervention was developed and pilot tested for fidelity toprotocol, for patient and interventionist feedback (qualitative) andeffect on quality of life. Engagement between patient andinterventionists was measured by the Working Alliance Inventory. Theintervention was refined on the basis of the results of the pilot studyand delivered in the active arm of a prospective randomized study.RESULTS: The pilot study suggested improvements in quality of life,fidelity to theory, and patient acceptability. The refinedself-management intervention was delivered 540 times in the active armof a randomized study. We observed a retention rate of 86% (patientsmissing or not available for only 14% the scheduled encounters).CONCLUSIONS: A self-management intervention that includes motivationalinterviewing as the way if guiding patients into behavior change isfeasible in severe COPD and may increase patient engagement andcommitment to self-management. This provides a very detailed descriptionof the process for the specifics of training and delivering theintervention, which facilitates replicability in other settings andcould be translated to cardiac rehabilitation."," 8"," 1"," 1"," 0"," 9"," 1932-7501"," WOS:000315595600008",NA,NA," 23434613",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Because species-specific brainmechanisms for fast vision must have evolved under heavy pressure forefficiency, it has been held that different human individuals see thephysical world in the same way and produce psychophysical functions ofvisual discrimination that are qualitatively the same. For many years,this assumption has been implicitly accepted in vision research studyingextremely fast, basic visual processes, including studies of visualmasking. However, in recent studies of metacontrast masking surprisinglyrobust individual differences in the qualitative aspects of subjects'performance have been found. As the basic species-specific visualfunctions very likely are based on universal brain mechanisms of vision,these differences probably are the outcome of variability in ontogeneticdevelopment (i.e., formation of idiosyncrasic skills of perception).Such developmental differences can be brought about by variants of genesthat are differentially expressed in the course of CNS development. Theobjective of this study was to assess whether visual discrimination inmetacontrast masking is related to three widely studied geneticpolymorphisms implicated in brain function and used here as independentvariables. The findings suggest no main effects of BDNF Val66Met,NRG1/rs6994992, or 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms on metacontrast performance,but several notable interactions of genetic variables with gender, stageof the sequence of experimental trials, perceptual strategies, andtarget/mask shape congruence were found. Thus, basic behavioralfunctions of fast vision may be influenced by common geneticvariability. Also, when left uncontrolled, genetic factors may seriouslyconfound variables in vision research using masking, obscure cleartheoretical interpretation, lead to unexplicable inter-regionaldifferences and create problems of replicability of formerly successfulexperiments."," 1"," 1"," 0"," 0"," 1"," 1932-6203"," WOS:000314023600163",NA,NA," 23359627",NA," e55287",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Conservation-induced displacement causes not just loss oflivelihood and dwellings but also increases vulnerability andimpoverishment risks of displaced people. By and large, the state'srecord of rehabilitating people displaced from PAs has been quite dismalin India. This article examines a rare case of conservation-induceddisplacement and resettlement where the livelihood outcomes for thedisplaced people are said to be positive. The relocation of over 400households from the Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary in Karnataka in the late1990s has been held up as a case where both conservation goals and localpeople's livelihoods gained from displacement. The success of Bhadra hasinspired a spate of calls by conservationists in India to use villagerelocation as a 'win-win' opportunity to attain simultaneously the goalsof wildlife conservation and poverty alleviation for forest-dwellingcommunities.

Honeyhas been used since ancient times as a remedy in wound care. Evidencefrom animal studies and some trials has suggested that honey mayaccelerate wound healing.OBJECTIVES: The objective was to determine whether honey increases therate of healing in acute wounds (e.g. burns, lacerations) and chronicwounds (e.g. skin ulcers, infected surgical wounds).SEARCH METHODS: For this first update of the review we searched theCochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 13 June 2012); TheCochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The CochraneLibrary 2012, Issue 5); Ovid MEDLINE (2008 to May Week 5 2012); OvidMEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations 12 June 2012); OvidEMBASE (2008 to 2012 Week 23); and EBSCO CINAHL (2008 to 8 June 2012).SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised trials thatevaluated honey as a treatment for any sort of acute or chronic woundwere sought. There was no restriction in terms of source, date ofpublication or language. Wound healing was the primary endpoint.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data from eligible trials were extractedand summarised by one review author, using a data extraction sheet, andindependently verified by a second review author.MAIN RESULTS: We identified 25 trials (with a total of 2987participants) that met the inclusion criteria, including six new trialsthat were added to this update. In acute wounds, three trials evaluatedthe effect of honey in acute lacerations, abrasions or minor surgicalwounds and 12 trials evaluated the effect of honey in burns. In chronicwounds, two trials evaluated the effect of honey in venous leg ulcers,and single trials investigated its effect in infected post-operativewounds, pressure injuries, cutaneous Lieshmaniasis, diabetic foot ulcersand Fournier's gangrene. Three trials recruited people into mixed groupsof chronic or acute wounds. Most trials were at high or unclear risk ofbias. In acute wounds, specifically partial-thickness burns, honey mightreduce time to healing compared with some conventional dressings (WMD-4.68 days, 95%CI -4.28 to -5.09 days), but, when compared with earlyexcision and grafting, honey delays healing in partial- andfull-thickness burns (WMD 13.6 days, 95% CI 10.02 to 17.18 days). Inchronic wounds, honey does not significantly increase healing in venousleg ulcers when used as an adjuvant to compression (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.96to 1.38), and may delay healing in cutaneous Leishmaniasis when used asan adjuvant to meglumine antimoniate compared to meglumine antimoniatealone (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.01).AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Honey dressings do not increase rates of healingsignificantly in venous leg ulcers when used as an adjuvant tocompression. Honey may delay healing in partial- and full-thicknessburns in comparison to early excision and grafting, and in cutaneousLeishmaniasis when used as an adjuvant with meglumine antimoniate. Honeymight be superior to some conventional dressing materials, but there isconsiderable uncertainty about the replicability and applicability ofthis evidence. There is insufficient evidence to guide clinical practicein other types of wounds, and purchasers should refrain from providinghoney dressings for routine use until sufficient evidence of effect isavailable."," 0"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 0",NA," MEDLINE:23450557",NA,NA," 23450557"," Jull, Andrew/I-1737-2013",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Honey has beenused since ancient times as a remedy in wound care. Evidence from animalstudies and some trials has suggested that honey may accelerate woundhealing.ObjectivesThe objective was to determine whether honey increases the rate ofhealing in acute wounds (e. g. burns, lacerations) and chronic wounds(e. g. skin ulcers, infected surgical wounds).Search methodsFor this first update of the review we searched the Cochrane WoundsGroup Specialised Register (searched 13 June 2012); The Cochrane CentralRegister of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012,Issue 5); Ovid MEDLINE (2008 to May Week 5 2012); Ovid MEDLINE(In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations 12 June 2012); Ovid EMBASE(2008 to 2012 Week 23); and EBSCO CINAHL (2008 to 8 June 2012).Selection criteriaRandomised and quasi-randomised trials that evaluated honey as atreatment for any sort of acute or chronic wound were sought. There wasno restriction in terms of source, date of publication or language.Wound healing was the primary endpoint.Data collection and analysisData from eligible trials were extracted and summarised by one reviewauthor, using a data extraction sheet, and independently verified by asecond review author.Main resultsWe identified 25 trials (with a total of 2987 participants) that met theinclusion criteria, including six new trials that were added to thisupdate. In acute wounds, three trials evaluated the effect of honey inacute lacerations, abrasions or minor surgical wounds and 12 trialsevaluated the effect of honey in burns. In chronic wounds, two trialsevaluated the effect of honey in venous leg ulcers, and single trialsinvestigated its effect in infected post-operative wounds, pressureinjuries, cutaneous Lieshmaniasis, diabetic foot ulcers and Fournier'sgangrene. Three trials recruited people into mixed groups of chronic oracute wounds. Most trials were at high or unclear risk of bias.In acute wounds, specifically partial-thickness burns, honey mightreduce time to healing compared with some conventional dressings (WMD-4.68 days, 95% CI -4.28 to -5.09 days), but, when compared with earlyexcision and grafting, honey delays healing in partial- andfull-thickness burns (WMD 13.6 days, 95% CI 10.02 to 17.18 days). Inchronic wounds, honey does not significantly increase healing in venousleg ulcers when used as an adjuvant to compression (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.96to 1.38), and may delay healing in cutaneous Leishmaniasis when used asan adjuvant to meglumine antimoniate compared to meglumine antimoniatealone (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.01).Authors' conclusionsHoney dressings do not increase rates of healing significantly in venousleg ulcers when used as an adjuvant to compression. Honey may delayhealing in partial-and full-thickness burns in comparison to earlyexcision and grafting, and in cutaneous Leishmaniasis when used as anadjuvant with meglumine antimoniate. Honey might be superior to someconventional dressing materials, but there is considerable uncertaintyabout the replicability and applicability of this evidence. There isinsufficient evidence to guide clinical practice in other types ofwounds, and purchasers should refrain from providing honey dressings forroutine use until sufficient evidence of effect is available."," 5"," 1"," 0"," 0"," 5"," 1469-493X"," WOS:000315461200012",NA,NA,NA," Jull, Andrew/I-1737-2013"," CD005083",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Methods: To support a new educational structureprioritizing QI education as a stand-alone priority, a 6-montheducational course was introduced for operational leaders (requiringcompletion of a real-life improvement project) and a second,introductory QI education set of 5 stand-alone classes was introducedfor managers and frontline staff; the latter is provided at centralizedsites, on-site, and via webinars. Additional QI courses have beenintroduced for board members. Results: Sixty operational leadersattended the first 2 offerings of the 6-month course and completed 50associated QI projects, as of July 2012; nearly 1500 participants haveattended the ""Just-in-Time"" classes, representing 13 University ofPittsburgh Medical Center hospitals and affiliated facilities.Eighty-three percent of recent participants rated the 6-month course a 4or 5 in terms of efficacy.

The first ideais that the adoption of a low alpha level (e.g., 5%) puts reasonablebounds on the rate at which errors can enter the published literature,making false-positive effects rare enough to be considered a minorissue. This, we point out, rests on statistical misunderstanding: Thealpha level imposes no limit on the rate at which errors may arise inthe literature (Ioannidis, 2005b). Second, some argue that whereasdirect replication attempts are uncommon, conceptual replicationattempts are common-providing an even better test of the validity of aphenomenon. We contend that performing conceptual rather than directreplication attempts interacts insidiously with publication bias,opening the door to literatures that appear to confirm the reality ofphenomena that in fact do not exist. Finally, we discuss the argumentthat errors will eventually be pruned out of the literature if the fieldwould just show a bit of patience.

Nearbymagnetic interference sources were simulated by attaching magnetizedparticles on the subject's head. Auditory and somatosensory stimuli werepresented. MC, tSSS and averaging were performed to obtain auditory(AEF) and somatosensory (SEF) evoked fields. Neuronal sources weremodeled as equivalent current dipoles. MC was also validated byreconstructing signals generated by current dipoles in a phantom.Results: After MC, the AEF and SEF responses recorded duringintermittent head movements were similar in amplitude to the referencerecordings and differed by 5-7 mm in source location.

Herpes keratitis is currentlythe leading cause of both cornea-derived and infection-associatedblindness in the developed world. Typical presentation of herpeskeratitis includes infection of the corneal epithelium and sometimes thedeeper corneal stroma and endothelium, leading to such permanent cornealpathologies as scarring, thinning, and opacity (1).Corneal HSV-1 infection is traditionally studied in two types ofexperimental models. The in vitro model, in which cultured monolayers ofcorneal epithelial cells are infected in a Petri dish, offerssimplicity, high level of replicability, fast experiments, andrelatively low costs. On the other hand, the in vivo model, in whichanimals such as rabbits or mice are inoculated directly in the cornea,offers a highly sophisticated physiological system, but has highercosts, longer experiments, necessary animal care, and a greater degreeof variability.In this video article, we provide a detailed demonstration of a new exvivo model of corneal epithelial HSV-1 infection, which combines thestrengths of both the in vitro and the in vivo models. The ex vivo modelutilizes intact corneas organotypically maintained in culture andinfected with HSV-1.

However the method is knownto be highly sensitive to initial seed selection of cluster centers.K-means++ has been proposed to overcome this problem and has been shownto have better accuracy and computational efficiency than k-means. Inmany clustering problems though - such as when classifying georeferenceddata for mapping applications - standardization of clusteringmethodology, specifically, the ability to arrive at the same clusterassignment for every run of the method i.e. replicability of themethodology, may be of greater significance than any perceived measureof accuracy, especially when the solution is known to be non-unique, asin the case of k-means clustering. Here we propose a simple initial seedselection algorithm for k-means clustering along one attribute thatdraws initial cluster boundaries along the ""deepest valleys"" or greatestgaps in dataset. Thus, it incorporates a measure to maximize distancebetween consecutive cluster centers which augments the conventionalk-means optimization for minimum distance between cluster center andcluster members. Unlike existing initialization methods, no additionalparameters or degrees of freedom are introduced to the clusteringalgorithm. This improves the replicability of cluster assignments by asmuch as 100% over k-means and k-means++, virtually reducing the varianceover different runs to zero, without introducing any additionalparameters to the clustering process. Further, the proposed method ismore computationally efficient than k-means++ and in some cases, moreaccurate. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In thispaper, I consider the implications of homoplasy for the debate over thenature of macroevolution. I argue that once the concepts of contingencyand convergence are fleshed out, it becomes clear that many instances ofhomoplasy fail to negate Gould's overarching thesis, and may in factsupport a Gouldian view of life. My argument rests on the distinctionbetween parallelism and convergence, which I defend against a recentchallenge from developmental biology.

A second analysis was designed to test the replicability of thegenetic findings in an independent sample of 109 women and 111 men witha similar history of substance dependence.

The proportion ofexclusions for comorbidities ranged from 042 percent for heart failure,0-55 percent for COPD, 0-44 percent for diabetes, and 0-39 percent forstroke. Seventy of the 161 trials (43.5%) described the prevalence ofany comorbidity among participants with the index disease. The reportingof comorbidities in trials was very limited, in terms of reporting anoperational definition and method of ascertainment for the presence ofcomorbidity and treatments for the comorbidity. It was even less commonthat the trials assessed whether comorbidities were potential modifiersof treatment effects.Conclusions: Comorbidities receive little attention in chronic diseasetrials. Given the public health importance of people with multiplechronic conditions, trials should better report on comorbidities andassess the effect comorbidities have on treatment outcomes."," 12"," 7"," 0"," 0"," 12"," 1932-6203"," WOS:000307284100023",NA,NA," 22870234",NA," e41601",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We begin by detailing informationnecessary for replicating the Social Security Administration's (SSA's)forecasting procedures, which until now has been unavailable in thepublic domain. We then offer a way to improve the quality of theseprocedures via age- and sex-specific mortality forecasts. The mostrecent SSA mortality forecasts were based on the best availabletechnology at the time, which was a combination of linear extrapolationand qualitative judgments. Unfortunately, linear extrapolation excludesknown risk factors and is inconsistent with long-standing demographicpatterns, such as the smoothness of age profiles. Modern statisticalmethods typically outperform even the best qualitative judgments inthese contexts. We show how to use such methods, enabling researchers toforecast using far more information, such as the known risk factors ofsmoking and obesity and known demographic patterns. Including this extrainformation makes a substantial difference. For example, by improvingonly mortality forecasting methods, we predict three fewer years of netsurplus, $730 billion less in Social Security Trust Funds, and programcosts that are 0.66% greater for projected taxable payroll by 2031compared with SSA projections. More important than specific numericalestimates are the advantages of transparency, replicability, reductionof uncertainty, and what may be the resulting lower vulnerability to thepoliticization of program forecasts. In addition, by offering with thisarticle software and detailed replication information, we hope tomarshal the efforts of the research community to include ever moreinformative inputs and to continue to reduce uncertainties in SocialSecurity forecasts."," 3"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 3"," 0070-3370"," WOS:000306335600013",NA,NA," 22592944",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Global Plan aspires to reduce new HIV infections amongchildren by 90 percent, and to reduce AIDS-related maternal mortality byhalf. This article summarizes the results of a review commissioned byUNAIDS to help inform stakeholders on promising practices in communityengagement to accelerate progress towards these ambitious goals.Methods: This research involved extensive literature review and keyinformant interviews. Community engagement was defined to includeparticipation, mobilization and empowerment while excluding activitiesthat involve communities solely as service recipients. A promisingpractice was defined as one for which there is documented evidence ofits effectiveness in achieving intended results and some indication ofreplicability, scale up and/or sustainability.Results: Promising practices that increased the supply of preventingmother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) services included extendingcommunity cadres, strengthening linkages with community- and faith-basedorganizations and civic participation in programme monitoring. Practicesto improve demand for PMTCT included community-led social and behaviourchange communication, peer support and participative approaches togenerate local solutions. Practices to create an enabling environmentincluded community activism and government leadership for greaterinvolvement of communities.Committed leadership at all levels, facility, community, district andnational, is crucial to success. Genuine community engagement requires arights-based, capacity-building approach and sustained financial andtechnical investment. Participative formative research is a first stepin building community capacity and helps to ensure programme relevance.Building on existing structures, rather than working in parallel tothem, improves programme efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability.Monitoring, innovation and information sharing are critical to scale up.Conclusions: Ten recommendations on community engagement are offered forending vertical transmission and enhancing the health of mothers andfamilies: (1) expand the frontline health workforce, (2) increaseengagement with community- and faith-based organizations, (3) engagecommunities in programme monitoring and accountability, (4) promotecommunity- driven social and behaviour change communication includinggrassroots campaigns and dialogues, (5) expand peer support, (6) empowercommunities to address programme barriers, (7) support communityactivism for political commitment, (8) share tools for communityengagement, (9) develop better indicators for community involvement and(10) conduct cost analyses of various community engagement strategies.As programmes expand, care should be taken to support and not toundermine work that communities are already doing, but rather toactively identify and build on such efforts."," 3"," 1"," 0"," 0"," 3"," 1758-2652"," WOS:000317490000003",NA," 2",NA,NA," 17390",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Theorizing that this relationship could beutilized to produce a short-term toxicity test, we analyzed theexperimental data and identified 36.5 degrees C as the ideal temperaturefor a 1-hour temperature-based toxicity test. After the test wasformulated, it was used to screen 15 toxicants. Eight heavy metals, 4pesticides, 2 anions, phenol, and 2 industrial wastewaters werescreened, using the 1-hour toxicity test and the 24-hour standard acutetoxicity test. For the 1-hour toxicity test, vials containing 5 daphnids(<24 h), medium, and toxicant, all at room temperature, were preparedand placed in a water bath set at 36.5 degrees C for 1 hour. After 1hour, the numbers of live (no toxic effect) daphnids and immobilized(toxic effect) daphnids were counted, and the median effectiveconcentrations (EC50) were determined.A comparison of the EC50 values of the 1-hour temperature-based toxicitytest and those of the 24-hour standard acute toxicity test produced acorrelation of 0.9999. When individual toxicants were compared, the24-hour standard acute toxicity test was better at detecting lower testconcentrations than the 1-hour temperature-based toxicity test. Whenboth tests were used to screen industrial wastewater and their resultswere compared, the 1-hour toxicity test showed some promise. However,further testing will need to be done, because only 2 of the 10 samplescollected initially contained significant amounts of toxicants for EC50calculation. Finally, while the 1-hour toxicity test was effective inscreening 15 tested toxicants and has the potential to be useful inscreening industrial wastewater, this conclusion is limited to those 15tested toxicants and 2 industrial wastewaters. Additional experimentswill be needed for other toxicants. The 1-hour toxicity test presentedin this study is the first temperature-based toxicity test developed forD. magna, and it will be an attractive short-term assay for itsconvenience, cost-efficiency, and replicability."," 1"," 1"," 0"," 0"," 1"," 1092-8758"," WOS:000306080200003",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

MBC deploys a clinically supervisedDepression Care Manager (DCM) to provide evidence-based antidepressanttreatment recommendations to a non-psychiatric prescribing provider,guided by systematic and ongoing measures of depressive symptoms andside effects. MBC has limited time requirements and the DCM role can beeffectively filled by a range of personnel given appropriate trainingand supervision, enhancing replicability. In SLAM DUNC, MBC isintegrated. into HIV care to support HIV providers in antidepressantprescription and management. The primary endpoint is ARV adherencemeasured by unannounced telephone-based pill counts at 6 months withfollow-up to 12 months and secondary endpoints including viral load,health care utilization, and depressive severity.

At the beginning of therehabilitation programme and at the end of primary treatment,respectively, patients completed a self-report questionnaire consistingof standardized instruments designed to assess the following independentvariables: autonomy striving (TPF), self-efficacy expectancy (GSE),distress (distress thermometer), anxiety and depression (HADS-D),quality of life (SF-8), social support (SSUK), rehabilitationmotivation: readiness to change, knowledge, scepticism regardingrehabilitation services (PAREMO-20). Illness- and treatment-relatedvariables (tumour state, comorbidity, primary therapies) were documentedby the attending oncologists.Results: Only few significant and effective differences betweenrehabilitation users and non-users are observed: Non-users are sufferingmore often from gastrointestinal comorbidities (18% vs. 2%, w=0.25).Both patient groups report severe quality-of-life impairments,particularly with respect to their physical functioning. Non-usersachieve significantly higher scores on the scale ""scepticism""(PAREMO-20) than users (eta(2)=0.19). The scale ""scepticism"" is alsoidentified as the dominant predictor of utilization of rehabilitationservices (R-2=0.23). Suffering from comorbid diseases of the digestivesystem, self-efficacy expectation and employment status emerge asfurther significant predictors (R-2=0.12, and R-2=0.02 each). Withincreasing scepticism and in case of comorbidity the probability ofrehabilitation utilization was decreasing.Conclusion: Besides illness-related variables prostate cancer patients'expectancies regarding the effectiveness of rehabilitation services toalleviate their medical conditions seem to be more relevant forrehabilitation utilization than sociodemographic variables orpsychosocial distress. Further studies should investigate thereplicability of these results and should focus on thedoctor-patient-communication and the amount of information about goalsand concepts of rehabilitation services prostate cancer patients aretold.

Symptom dimensions have not yet been comprehensively testedas predictors of the substantial heterogeneity in outcomes ofantidepressant treatment in major depressive disorder.Method. We tested nine symptom dimensions derived from a previouslypublished factor analysis of depression rating scales as predictors ofoutcome in 811 adults with moderate to severe depression treated withflexibly dosed escitalopram or nortriptyline in Genome-based TherapeuticDrugs for Depression (GENDEP). The effects of symptom dimensions weretested in mixed-effect regression models that controlled for overallinitial depression severity, age, sex and recruitment centre.Significant results were tested for replicability in 3637 adultout-patients with non-psychotic major depression treated with citalopramin level I of Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression(STAR*D).Results. The interest-activity symptom dimension (reflecting lowinterest, reduced activity, indecisiveness and lack of enjoyment) atbaseline strongly predicted poor treatment outcome in GENDEP,irrespective of overall depression severity, antidepressant type andoutcome measure used. The prediction of poor treatment outcome by theinterest-activity dimension was robustly replicated in STAR*D,independent of a comprehensive list of baseline covariates.Conclusions. Loss of interest, diminished activity and inability to makedecisions predict poor outcome of antidepressant treatment even afteradjustment for overall depression severity and other clinicalcovariates. The prominence of such symptoms may require additionaltreatment strategies and should be accounted for in futureinvestigations of antidepressant response."," 20"," 14"," 0"," 0"," 20"," 0033-2917"," WOS:000302379800008",NA,NA," 21929846"," McGuffin, Peter/A-1565-2012; Uher, Rudolf/A-5477-2008; Aitchison, Katherine/G-4476-2013",NA,NA,NA,NA," McGuffin, Peter/0000-0002-9888-2907; Uher, Rudolf/0000-0002-2998-0546;Aitchison, Katherine/0000-0002-1107-3024",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To increase the reliability and accuracy of publishedpapers, multiple changes have been proposed, such as changes instatistical methods. We support such reforms. However, we believe thatthe incentive structure of scientific publishing must change for suchreforms to be successful. Under the current system, the quality ofindividual scientists is judged on the basis of their number ofpublications and citations, with journals similarly judged via numbersof citations. Neither of these measures takes into account thereplicability of the published findings, as false or controversialresults are often particularly widely cited. We propose trackingreplications as a means of post-publication evaluation, both to helpresearchers identify reliable findings and to incentivize thepublication of reliable results. Tracking replications requires adatabase linking published studies that replicate one another. As anysuch database is limited by the number of replication attemptspublished, we propose establishing an open-access journal dedicated topublishing replication attempts. Data quality of both the database andthe affiliated journal would be ensured through a combination ofcrowd-sourcing and peer review. As reports in the database areaggregated, ultimately it will be possible to calculate replicabilityscores, which may be used alongside citation counts to evaluate thequality of work published in individual journals.

In this paper, we argue thatmany of the difficulties facing CNS drug discovery stem from a lack ofrobustness in pre-clinical (i.e., non-human animal) testing. There aretwo main sources for this lack of robustness. First, there is the lackof replicability of many results from the pre-clinical stage, which weargue is driven by a combination of publication bias and inappropriateselection of statistical and experimental designs. Second, there is thefrequent failure to translate results in non-human animals to parallelresults in humans in the clinic. This limitation can only be overcome bydeveloping new behavioral tests for non-human animals that havepredictive, construct, and etiological validity. Here, we present thesetranslational difficulties as a ""grand challenge"" to researchers fromcomparative cognition, who are well positioned to provide new methodsfor testing behavior and cognition in non-human animals. These newexperimental protocols will need to be both statistically robust andtarget behavioral and cognitive processes that allow for betterconnection with human CNS disorders.

The goals of this manuscript are to review the literature ontreatment trials utilizing manualized psychotherapy treatments for FSDand to explore the benefits and research issues associated with theflexible use of treatment manuals.Methods. The method used was the review of the relevant literature.Results. While the use of manualized treatments for FSDs can addresscertain methodological issues inherent in psychotherapy research,flexibility in manual administration is necessary in order to allowtailoring for individual needs that can be beneficial to both theparticipant and the research. The flexible use of manuals, as opposed tostrict manual adherence, may also be more relevant for clinical utility.Conclusions. In order to administer manualized treatments for FSDs withappropriate flexibility, while also maximizing internal validity andreplicability, the authors recommend that predetermined decision rulesbe utilized to guide individual tailoring, that potential gaps in themanual be identified and addressed, and that differing levels ofmotivation and readiness for treatment be taken into consideration inthe treatment protocol.

However, while systems areaging, meaningful business knowledge that is not present in any of theorganization's other assets gradually becomes embedded in them. Thepreservation of this knowledge through the recovery of the underlyingbusiness processes is, therefore, a critical problem. This paperprovides, as a solution to the aforementioned problem, a model-drivenprocedure for recovering business processes from legacy informationsystems. The procedure proposes a set of models at different abstractionlevels, along with the model transformations between them.

WiFi positioning typically has very fast time-to-first-fix andcan provide reliable location information when GPS signals are too weakfor a position fix. Several commercial WiFi positioning systems havebeen developed in recent years and most newer model smart phones havethe technology embedded. This study empirically determined theperformance of WiFi positioning system on two different mobile devices.Skyhook's system, running on an iPhone and a laptop, was selected forthis study. Field work was carried out in three cities at a total of 90sites. The positional accuracy of WiFi positioning was found to be verysimilar on the two devices with no statistically significant differencebetween the two error distributions. This suggests that thereplicability of WiFi positioning on different devices is high based onaggregate performance metrics. Median values for positional accuracy inthe three study areas ranged from 43 to 92 m. These results are similarto earlier independent evaluations of Skyhook's system. The number ofaccess points (APs) observed on the iPhone was consistently lower thanthat on the laptop. This lower number of APs, however, was not found toreduce positional accuracy. In general, no relationship was foundbetween the number of APs and positional accuracy for either device,counter to earlier findings. The results indicate, however, that WiFipositioning can be achieved with a small number of APs (5-10), but thatincreased numbers of APs do not contribute to improved positionalaccuracy. Despite the agreement in aggregate performance metrics betweenthe two devices, the replicability of WiFi positioning using Skyhook'ssystem in terms of getting the same location by using two differentdevices at approximately the same place and time was relatively poor.Implications for location-based services on mobile devices arediscussed."," 2"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 2"," 1748-9725"," INSPEC:13209357",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In five experiments (Experiment 1, n =53; Experiment 2, n = 177; Experiment 3, n = 36; Experiment 4, n = 6;Experiment 5, n = 2), we tested several factors potentially influencingretrieval biases-for example, by varying the general procedure ofreproduction (repeated vs. serial) and by omitting versus providingvisual or semantic cues for activating face schemata.

None of theexperiments revealed a systematic tendency towards Bartlett's describedcase, even when the participants were explicitly instructed to draw ""aface"" like the previously inspected one.

It offers a threedimensional framework of research methodology that spans the assumeddivide and shows that quantitative and qualitative research approachescan be mutually complementary and offer a more nuanced approximation ofthe truth. The framework, Research methodology in 3D, is based on ameta-methodological analysis and consists of three root dimensions,namely, firstly, four constituent components presented in all forms ofresearch (concepts, questions/hypotheses, observation/measurement andcommunication). The second dimension of the framework consists of thecore set of criteria that all scientific research must comply with(reliability, validity, 'objectivity' and replicability), each may beexpressed under different labels and in different forms depending on thespecific research tradition. The third dimension represents the basicgoals of research, viz. to describe, to explain or to understand. Athree dimensional framework emerges when the above dimensions arecombined. The framework shows some of the tangent planes betweenquantitative and qualitative scientific research and suggests possiblecomplementarity between research approaches. The framework furthermoreserves at least the following functions: firstly, as map to assiststudents in charting their way through a maze of new concepts.

They seek to evaluate how different factors impactduring the initiation and implementation phases of the adoption process.Design/methodology/approach - The authors base the methodologicalapproach on two exploratory case studies with a contrasting resultlogic. They build a multi-level framework grounded both on literaturereview, and feedback from stakeholders. They then apply the framework totwo case studies to better frame the findings. They consider phases ofadoption (initiation, implementation) and the levels of adoption(technological, organizational, environmental, individual).Findings - In the case studies, the authors found the importance of astrong and decision-centric management board to give the impulse for theinitiation phase of the process. As perceived by the stakeholders, astrong governmental support is of paramount importance to increase theadoption at the public level, although in the case studies examined theinitiation stage started from the impulse of a championing management.Both case studies passed the initiation phase successfully. Continuousemployees' training, organizational objectives consensus, and businessprocess reengineering have been found important for the implementationphase. In the case study in which these factors were not in place, theimplementation phase of adoption failed. Environmental factors -although relevant for the initiation of the adoption process - are lesssignificant during the actual implementation of the adoption process, asthe contrasting result logic from the case studies shows.Research limitations/implications - The study refers to two publicorganizations in a specific environmental setting. No causality amongfactors has been inferred. Quantitative objective data have been used todetermine the success of adoption, for qualitative data multiple sourceshave been used when possible to limit threats to validity.Practical implications - The framework can be used by stakeholders inpublic organizations to better frame their adoption strategies and tocompare results across institutions.

The aim of this study was toinvestigate the replicability of these findings using an improvedversion of the Everyday Technology Use Questionnaire (ETUQ) to compareperceptions of relevance and difficulty in ET use in participants withMCI or Alzheimer's disease (AD) and controls. Additional aims were toexplore the validity of ETUQ, and the relationships between perceiveddifficulty in ET use and cognitive status, mood state, and involvementin everyday life activities. In total, 118 participants were included,37 with AD, 37 with MCI, and 44 controls.Results: Analyses confirmed that the rating scale of the ETUQ functionedwell. The three groups overlapped but differed significantly in theirperceptions of ETs relevance (p<0.05) as well as of difficulties in ETuse (p<0.001). Moderate correlations were also found between ETUQmeasures and cognitive status, mood, and involvement in activities, thestrongest being that between ETUQ measures and involvement in activities(r=0.563).Conclusion: Taken together, the findings underscore the plausibility ofdisability already in people with MCI, as the use of ET stronglycorrelates to involvement in activities.

Few years back, Stategovernment with funding support from World Bank installed Rural WaterSupply and Environmental Sanitation Projects with NGOs and communitysupport. The idea was that with the installation of such projects, timeused in water collection would be considerably saved which a ruralhousehold can utilise in economic activities to earn additional income.The total income, thus, earned would provide an economic advantage whensuch benefits exceeded the costs incurred in these projects. Theanalysis in the paper focused on two issues. (i) The situationalanalysis of various dimensions of drinking water collection in theState.

However, in mesocosmstudies, the number of replicates is limited by practical and financialconstraints. In addition, high levels of biological organization arecharacterized by a high variability of descriptive variables. Thisvariability and the poor number of replicates have been recognized as amajor drawback for detecting significant effects of chemicals inmesocosm studies. In this context, a tool able to predict preciselycontrol mesocosms outputs, to which endpoints in mesocosms exposed tochemicals could be compared should constitute a substantial improvement.We evaluated here a solution which consists in stochastic modelling ofthe control fish populations to assess the probabilistic distributionsof population endpoints. An individual-based approach was selected,because it generates realistic fish length distributions and accountsfor both individual and environmental sources of variability. Thisstrategy was applied to mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) populationsmonitored in lentic mesocosms. We chose the number of founders as aso-called ""stressor"" because subsequent consequences at the populationlevel could be expected. Using this strategy, we were able to detectmore significant and biologically relevant perturbations than usingclassical methods. We conclude that designing an individual-based modelis very promising for improving mesocosm data analysis.

The Global Plan aspires to reduce new HIV infections amongchildren by 90 percent, and to reduce AIDS-related maternal mortality byhalf. This article summarizes the results of a review commissioned byUNAIDS to help inform stakeholders on promising practices in communityengagement to accelerate progress towards these ambitious goals.METHODS: This research involved extensive literature review and keyinformant interviews. Community engagement was defined to includeparticipation, mobilization and empowerment while excluding activitiesthat involve communities solely as service recipients. A promisingpractice was defined as one for which there is documented evidence ofits effectiveness in achieving intended results and some indication ofreplicability, scale up and/or sustainability.RESULTS: Promising practices that increased the supply of preventingmother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) services included extendingcommunity cadres, strengthening linkages with community- and faith-basedorganizations and civic participation in programme monitoring. Practicesto improve demand for PMTCT included community-led social and behaviourchange communication, peer support and participative approaches togenerate local solutions. Practices to create an enabling environmentincluded community activism and government leadership for greaterinvolvement of communities. Committed leadership at all levels,facility, community, district and national, is crucial to success.Genuine community engagement requires a rights-based, capacity-buildingapproach and sustained financial and technical investment. Participativeformative research is a first step in building community capacity andhelps to ensure programme relevance. Building on existing structures,rather than working in parallel to them, improves programme efficiency,effectiveness and sustainability. Monitoring, innovation and informationsharing are critical to scale up.CONCLUSIONS: Ten recommendations on community engagement are offered forending vertical transmission and enhancing the health of mothers andfamilies: (1) expand the frontline health workforce, (2) increaseengagement with community- and faith-based organizations, (3) engagecommunities in programme monitoring and accountability, (4) promotecommunity-driven social and behaviour change communication includinggrassroots campaigns and dialogues, (5) expand peer support, (6) empowercommunities to address programme barriers, (7) support communityactivism for political commitment, (8) share tools for communityengagement, (9) develop better indicators for community involvement and(10) conduct cost analyses of various community engagement strategies.As programmes expand, care should be taken to support and not toundermine work that communities are already doing, but rather toactively identify and build on such efforts."," 0"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 0",NA," MEDLINE:22789645",NA,NA," 22789645",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

First, we explore the feasibilityof conducting online expert panels to facilitate consensus finding amonga large number of geographically distributed stakeholders. Second, wetest the replicability of panel findings across four panels of differentsize.Method: We engaged 119 panelists in an iterative process to identifydefinitional features of Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI). Weconducted four parallel online panels of different size through threeone-week phases by using the RAND's ExpertLens process. In Phase I,participants rated potentially definitional CQI features. In Phase II,they discussed rating results online, using asynchronous, anonymousdiscussion boards. In Phase III, panelists re-rated Phase I features andreported on their experiences as participants.Results: 66% of invited experts participated in all three phases. 62% ofPhase I participants contributed to Phase II discussions and 87% of themcompleted Phase III. Panel disagreement, measured by the mean absolutedeviation from the median (MAD-M), decreased after group feedback anddiscussion in 36 out of 43 judgments about CQI features. Agreementbetween the four panels after Phase III was fair (four-way kappa =0.36); they agreed on the status of five out of eleven CQI features.Results of the post-completion survey suggest that participants weregenerally satisfied with the online process. Compared to participants insmaller panels, those in larger panels were more likely to agree thatthey had debated each others' view points.Conclusion: It is feasible to conduct online expert panels intended tofacilitate consensus finding among geographically distributedparticipants. The online approach may be practical for engaging largeand diverse groups of stakeholders around a range of health servicesresearch topics and can help conduct multiple parallel panels to testfor the reproducibility of panel conclusions."," 5"," 2"," 0"," 0"," 5"," 1471-2288"," WOS:000302463200001",NA,NA," 22196011",NA," 174",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Therefore, uncertainty characterization in changecategorization should be based on discriminant modeling of measurementerrors and semantic mismatch analysis, enabling quantification ofuncertainty due to partially random measurement errors, and systematiccategorical discrepancies, respectively."," 1"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 1"," 1009-5020"," INSPEC:13239881",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The accumulation of MMN was modeled empirically with respectto measurement error, and repeatability was estimated at 0.6-3.5-mu Verror levels. The analysis was made for the results in the singledeviant conditions and their pattern (auditory discrimination profile).Results: At the single-subject level, the measurement errorsignificantly affected the repeatability until it went below 9-17% ofMMN peak amplitude. At the group level, the threshold was higher. Peakamplitude was generally the most repeatable parameter.

This paper assesses thepotential of such partnerships as a 'model' for contributing to theMDGs, by focusing on 4 water utilities in Mozambique. Although, thestudy found these partnerships to be successful, it is more scepticalabout the potential for this type of water operator partnership tosignificantly contribute towards achieving the MDGs. The main reason forthis is that the replicability of the partnership-model studied inMozambique was found to be quite limited. The case presented in thisarticle highlights 3 main lessons for water operator partnerships in thewater services sector. First, the availability of investment funds is acrucial component of a partnership. Without access to such funds theimpact of such a partnership is likely to be limited. Secondly, thelevel of commitment to the partnership needs to be high if it is to besuccessful. This commitment is likely to take shape in the form of bothfinancial commitment as well as commitment of time and effort of theorganisations involved. Thirdly, even if the partnership is a success,the question of how sustainable the achieved performance gains areremains a point of concern. All in all, although we acknowledge thesuccess achieved by the studied partnership, the findings have made ushesitant about the potential for replicating this 'model' at a largescale."," 2"," 1"," 0"," 0"," 2"," 0378-4738"," WOS:000296882200017",NA,NA,NA," Schwartz, Klaas/M-4311-2013",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

As one such technique,logistic regression is an efficient and powerful way to analyze theeffect of a group of independent variables on a binary outcome byquantifying each independent variable's unique contribution. Usingcomponents of linear regression reflected in the logit scale, logisticregression iteratively identifies the strongest linear combination ofvariables with the greatest probability of detecting the observedoutcome. Important considerations when conducting logistic regressioninclude selecting independent variables, ensuring that relevantassumptions are met, and choosing an appropriate model buildingstrategy. For independent variable selection, one should be guided bysuch factors as accepted theory, previous empirical investigations,clinical considerations, and univariate statistical analyses, withacknowledgement of potential confounding variables that should beaccounted for. Basic assumptions that must be met for logisticregression include independence of errors, linearity in the logit forcontinuous variables, absence of multicollinearity, and lack of stronglyinfluential outliers. Additionally, there should be an adequate numberof events per independent variable to avoid an overfit model, withcommonly recommended minimum ""rules of thumb"" ranging from 10 to 20events per covariate. Regarding model building strategies, the threegeneral types are direct/standard, sequential/hierarchical, andstepwise/statistical, with each having a different emphasis and purpose.Before reaching definitive conclusions from the results of any of thesemethods, one should formally quantify the model's internal validity(i.e., replicability within the same data set) and external validity(i.e., generalizability beyond the current sample). The resultinglogistic regression model's overall fit to the sample data is assessedusing various goodness-of-fit measures, with better fit characterized bya smaller difference between observed and model-predicted values. Use ofdiagnostic statistics is also recommended to further assess the adequacyof the model. Finally, results for independent variables are typicallyreported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE 2011; 18:1099-1104 (C) 2011 by the Societyfor Academic Emergency Medicine"," 13"," 7"," 0"," 0"," 13"," 1069-6563"," WOS:000296050100013",NA,NA," 21996075",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The World Food Programme and the Office ofthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees organized a meeting ofexperts to discuss evaluation of micronutrient interventions underspecial circumstances, such as emergency and refugee situations.Results. Multimicronutrient interventions for groups with higher needsmay include home fortification products for young children orsupplements for pregnant and lactating women. The choice of preparationshould be guided by target group needs, evidence of efficacy of aproduct or its compounds, acceptability, and cost-effectiveness.Different designs can be used to assess whether an intervention has thedesired impact. First, program implementation and adherence must beascertained. Then, impact on micronutrient status can be assessed, butdesign options are often limited by logistic challenges, availablebudget, security issues, and ethical and practical issues regardingnonintervention or placebo groups. Under these conditions, aplausibility design using pre- and post-intervention cross-sectionalsurveys, a prospective cohort study, or a step-wedge design, whichenrolls groups as they start receiving the intervention, should beconsidered. Post hoc comparison of groups with different adherencelevels may also be useful. Hemoglobin is often selected as an impactindicator because it is easily measured and tends to respond to changein micronutrient status, especially iron. However, it is not a veryspecific indicator of micronutrient status, because it is alsoinfluenced by inflammation, parasitic infestation, physiological status(age, pregnancy), altitude, and disorders such as thalassemia and sicklecell disease.Conclusion. Given the constraints described above, replicability ofimpact in different contexts is key to the validation of micronutrientinterventions."," 4"," 2"," 0"," 0"," 4"," 0379-5721"," WOS:000295861100009",NA,NA," 22073799"," Seal, Andrew/C-8550-2014",NA,NA,NA,NA," Seal, Andrew/0000-0003-3656-4054",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Moreover, the replicability of prey DNA detection amongindividual PCR assays was tested using beetles and spiders that haddigested their prey for extended times postfeeding. By screening allpredators for three differently sized prey DNA fragments (range 116-612bp), we found that only in the longest PCR product, a marked decrease inprey detection success occurred. Lowering maximum annealing temperaturesby 4 degrees C resulted in significantly increased prey DNA detectionrates in both predator taxa. Among the three post-PCR visualizationmethods, an eightfold difference in sensitivity was observed. Repeatedscreening of predators increased the total number of samples scoringpositive, although the proportion of samples testing positive did notvary significantly between different PCRs.

Inthe present study, we used reverse genetics to construct a reassortantvirus (rH1N1) with the same gene combination as H1N1/2009 virus (NA andM genes from a Eurasian avian-like H1N1 swine virus and another sixgenes from a North American triple-reassortant H1N2 swine virus).Characterization of rH1N1 in mice showed that this virus had higherreplicability and pathogenicity than those of the seasonal human H1N1and Eurasian avian-like swine H1N1 viruses, but was similar to theH1N1/2009 and triple-reassortant H1N2 viruses. Experiments performed onguinea pigs showed that rH1N1 was not transmissible, whereas pandemicH1N1/2009 displayed efficient transmissibility. To further determinewhich gene segment played a key role in transmissibility, we constructeda series of reassortants derived from rH1N1 and H1N1/2009 viruses.Direct contact transmission studies demonstrated that the HA and NSgenes contributed to the transmission of H1N1/2009 virus. Second, the HAgene of H1N1/2009 virus, when combined with the H1N1/2009 NA gene,conferred efficient contact transmission among guinea pigs.

The four food webs were similarly complex, consisting of diverseassemblages (61-71 taxa) with dense feeding interactions (directedconnectance 0 center dot 09-0 center dot 11). Mesocosm food webstructural attributes were within the range reported for 82well-characterized food webs from natural streams and rivers. Whencompared with 112 additional food webs from standing freshwater, marine,estuarine and terrestrial environments, stream food webs (includingmesocosms) had similar characteristic path lengths, but typically lowermean food chain length and exponents for the species-link relationship.4. Body size (M) abundance (N) allometric scaling coefficients fortrivariate taxonomic mesocosm food webs (-0 center dot 53 to -0 centerdot 49) and individual size distributions (-0 center dot 60 to -0 centerdot 58) were consistent and similar to those from natural systems,suggesting that patterns of energy flux between mesocosm consumers andresources were realistic approximations.5. These results suggest that stream mesocosms of this scale can supportreplicate food webs with a degree of biocomplexity that is comparable to'natural' streams.

Despitethe strong evidentiary link, little work has been done to determine whatprimary care health providers can do to address their patients' incomeas a risk to their health. This qualitative study explores the barriersto primary care responsiveness to poverty as a health issue in awell-resourced jurisdiction with near-universal health care insurancecoverage.Methods: One to one interviews were conducted with twelve experts onpoverty and health in primary care in Ontario, Canada. Participantsincluded family physicians, specialist physicians, nurse practitioners,community workers, advocates, policy experts and researchers. Theinterviews were analysed for anticipated and emergent themes.Results: This study reveals provider-and patient-centred structural,attitudinal, and knowledge-based barriers to addressing poverty as arisk to health. While many of its findings reinforce previous work inthis area, this study's findings point to a number of areas front lineprimary care providers could target to address their patients' poverty.These include a lack of provider understanding of the lived reality ofpoverty, leading to a failure to collect adequate data about patients'social circumstances, and to the development of inappropriate careplans. Participants also pointed to prejudicial attitudes amongproviders, a failure of primary care disciplines to incorporateapproaches to poverty as a standard of care, and a lack of knowledge ofconcrete steps providers can take to address patients' poverty.Conclusions: While this study reinforces, in a well-resourcedjurisdiction such as Ontario, the previously reported existence ofsignificant barriers to addressing income as a health issue withinprimary care, the findings point to the possibility of front lineprimary care providers taking direct steps to address the health risksposed by poverty. The consistent direction and replicability of thesefindings point to a refocusing of the research agenda toward anexamination of interventions to decrease the health impacts of poverty."," 6"," 2"," 0"," 0"," 6"," 1471-2296"," WOS:000292681500001",NA,NA," 21714925",NA," 62",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Owing to affordability and easyavailability, use of first-generation antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) isheavily encouraged for the treatment of epilepsy in resource-limitedcountries such as India. Although first-generation AEDs are at par withsecond-generation AEDs in terms of efficacy, adverse drug reactions(ADRs) are quite common with them. This could be attributed to theinferior pharmacokinetic parameters such as nonlinear metabolism, narrowtherapeutic index and formation of toxic intermediates. In addition,epilepsy patients may differ in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamicprofiles, with about 1/3(rd) of the population failing to respond totreatment. A proportion of this interindividual variability in responsemay be explained by genetic heterogeneity in the activity and expressionof the network of proteins such as metabolizing enzymes, transportersand targets of AEDs. Over the last two decades, a considerable efforthas been made by the scientific community for unraveling this geneticbasis of variable response to AEDs. However, there have beeninconsistencies in such genetic association studies conducted acrossdifferent territories of the world.

The reliability of this method was, assessed on a sample of47 Portuguese known sex and age skeletons representing individuals frombirth to 15 years of age.

When broken downby age, the least accuracy was observed for the 6-15 years-old group(54.5%) and the greatest accuracy was achieved for the 2 -5 years-old(75.0%), but still low overall.

Molecular population genetics studies of polyploid organismshave been difficult because of problems in sequencing multiple-copynuclear genes using Sanger sequencing. This paper describes a method forsequencing a barcoded mixture of targeted gene regions usingnext-generation sequencing methods to overcome these problems.Results: Using 64 3-bp barcodes, we successfully sequenced threechloroplast and two nuclear gene regions (each of which contained twogene copies with up to two alleles per individual) in a total of 60individuals across 11 species of Australian Poa grasses. This method hadhigh replicability, a low sequencing error rate (after appropriatequality control) and a low rate of missing data. Eighty-eight percent ofthe 320 gene/individual combinations produced sequence reads, and >80%of individuals produced sufficient reads to detect all four possiblenuclear alleles of the homeologous nuclear loci with 95% probability.We applied this method to a group of sympatric Australian alpine Poaspecies, which we discovered to share an allopolyploid ancestor with agroup of American Poa species. All markers revealed extensive allelesharing among the Australian species and so we recommend that thecurrent taxonomy be re-examined. We also detected hypermutation in thetrnH-psbA marker, suggesting it should not be used as a land plantbarcode region. Some markers indicated differentiation between Tasmanianand mainland samples. Significant positive spatial genetic structure wasdetected at <100 km with chloroplast but not nuclear markers, which maybe a result of restricted seed flow and long-distance pollen flow inthis wind-pollinated group.Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that 454 sequencing of barcodedamplicon mixtures can be used to reliably sample all alleles ofhomeologous loci in polyploid species and successfully investigatephylogenetic relationships among species, as well as to investigatephylogeographic hypotheses. This next-generation sequencing method ismore affordable than and at least as reliable as bacterial cloning. Itcould be applied to any experiment involving sequencing of ampliconmixtures."," 31"," 31"," 0"," 0"," 31"," 1741-7007"," WOS:000289548600001",NA,NA," 21429199"," Hoffmann, Ary/C-2961-2011; Robin, Charles/F-7786-2010"," 19",NA,NA,NA," Robin, Charles/0000-0002-7733-6763",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The development ofeffective interventions is hampered by the absence of a nomenclature tospecify and report their content. This limits the possibility ofreplicating effective interventions, synthesising evidence, andunderstanding the causal mechanisms underlying behaviour change. Incontrast, biomedical interventions are precisely specified (e.g., thepharmacological 'ingredients' of prescribed drugs, their dose andfrequency of administration). For most complex interventions, theprecise 'ingredients' are unknown; descriptions (e.g., 'behaviouralcounseling') can mean different things to different researchers orimplementers. The lack of a method for specifying complex interventionsundermines the precision of evidence syntheses of effectiveness, posinga problem for secondary, as well as primary, research.We aim to develop a reliable method of specifying interventioncomponents ('techniques') aimed at changing behaviour.Methods/Design: The research will be conducted in three phases. Thefirst phase will develop the nomenclature. We will refine a preliminarylist of techniques and definitions. Using a formal consensus method,experts will then define the key attributes of each technique and how itrelates to, and differs from, others. They will evaluate the techniquesand their definitions until they achieve an agreed-upon list of clearlydefined, nonredundant techniques. The second phase will test thenomenclature. Trained experts (primary researchers and systematicreviewers), equipped with a coding manual and guidance, will use thenomenclature to code published descriptions of complex interventions.Reliability between experts, over time, and across types of users willbe assessed. We will assess whether using the nomenclature to writeintervention descriptions enhances the clarity and replicability ofinterventions. The third phase will develop a web-based users' resourceof clearly specified and nonredundant techniques, which will aid thescientific understanding of, and development of, effective complexinterventions. Dissemination throughout the project will be throughstakeholder meetings, targeted multidisciplinary workshops, conferencepresentation, journal publication, and publication in an interactiveweb-based platform (a Wiki).Discussion: The development of a reliable method of specifyingintervention components aimed at changing behaviour will strengthen thescientific basis for developing, evaluating, and reporting complexinterventions.

However, the intrasubject reliability of this response in bothoptimal and challenging listening conditions has not yet beensystematically documented. This study aimed to evaluate test-retestreliability of the speech-evoked ABR in young adults.Methods: In each of two sessions, ABRs were obtained with: (1) a 170 ms/da/ syllable presented in quiet as well as 2-talker and 6-talker babblebackground noise conditions and (2) a 40 ms /da/ syllable presented inquiet. Test-retest reliability of the responses was analyzed in thefrequency and time domains. Results: The speech-evoked ABR does not varysignificantly across sessions within individuals on measures of temporalencoding (i.e., peak latencies, stimulus-to-response andresponse-to-response measures), frequency representation and responsemagnitude.Conclusions: The subcortical auditory pathway produces a response to acomplex sound that is stable and replicable from session to session.Significance: By demonstrating the high degree of replicability inoptimal and challenging listening conditions, the applicability of thespeech-evoked ABR may be increased to examining a range of auditoryprocessing abilities in clinical and research settings.

More than 51,000 potential associations have been studied andpublished, a figure that keeps increasing, especially with the recentexplosion of array-based Genome-Wide Association Studies. Even if thenumber of true associations described so far is high, many of theputative risk variants detected so far have failed to be consistentlyreplicated and are widely considered false positives. Here, we focus onthe worldwide patterns of replicability of published associationstudies.Results: We report three main findings. First, contrary to previousresults, genes associated to complex diseases present lower degrees ofgenetic differentiation among human populations than average genome-widelevels. Second, also contrary to previous results, the differences inreplicability of disease associated-loci between Europeans and EastAsians are highly correlated with genetic differentiation between thesepopulations. Finally, highly replicated genes present increased levelsof high-frequency derived alleles in European and Asian populations whencompared to African populations.Conclusions: Our findings highlight the heterogeneous nature of thegenetic etiology of complex disease, confirm the importance of therecent evolutionary history of our species in current patterns ofdisease susceptibility and could cast doubts on the status as falsepositives of some associations that have failed to replicate acrosspopulations."," 6"," 6"," 0"," 0"," 6"," 1471-2164"," WOS:000287412600001",NA,NA," 21261943"," Serra, Francois/A-8789-2011; Bertranpetit, Jaume/F-8550-2012; Faria, Rui/F-8778-2012; Calafell, Francesc/C-8595-2014; Bosch, Elena/D-8681-2014; Navarro, Arcadi/F-1592-2011; Marigorta, Urko/L-9512-2014"," 55",NA,NA,NA," Faria, Rui/0000-0001-6635-685X; Calafell, Francesc/0000-0002-1083-9438;Bosch, Elena/0000-0003-2848-103X; Navarro, Arcadi/0000-0003-2162-8246;Marigorta, Urko/0000-0002-9087-6609",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Despite their growing importance,many methodological aspects have not yet been evaluated but need to beconsidered to fully exploit the potential of this approach. Usingfeeding experiments with high alpine carabid beetles and lycosidspiders, we investigated how PCR annealing temperature affects prey DNAdetection success and how post-PCR visualization methods differ in theirsensitivity. Moreover, the replicability of prey DNA detection amongindividual PCR assays was tested using beetles and spiders that haddigested their prey for extended times postfeeding. By screening allpredators for three differently sized prey DNA fragments (range 116-612bp), we found that only in the longest PCR product, a marked decrease inprey detection success occurred. Lowering maximum annealing temperaturesby 4 A°C resulted in significantly increased prey DNA detection rates inboth predator taxa. Among the three post-PCR visualization methods, aneightfold difference in sensitivity was observed. Repeated screening ofpredators increased the total number of samples scoring positive,although the proportion of samples testing positive did not varysignificantly between different PCRs. The present findings demonstratethat assay sensitivity, in combination with other methodologicalfactors, plays a crucial role to obtain robust trophic interaction data.Future work employing molecular prey detection should thus consider andminimize the methodologically induced variation that would also allowfor better cross-study comparisons."," 1"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 1",NA," DRCI:DATA2012217002440417",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Owing to affordability and easyavailability, use of first-generation antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) isheavily encouraged for the treatment of epilepsy in resource-limitedcountries such as India. Although first-generation AEDs are at par withsecond-generation AEDs in terms of efficacy, adverse drug reactions(ADRs) are quite common with them. This could be attributed to theinferior pharmacokinetic parameters such as nonlinear metabolism, narrowtherapeutic index and formation of toxic intermediates. In addition,epilepsy patients may differ in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamicprofiles, with about 1/3rd of the population failing to respond totreatment. A proportion of this interindividual variability in responsemay be explained by genetic heterogeneity in the activity and expressionof the network of proteins such as metabolizing enzymes, transportersand targets of AEDs. Over the last two decades, a considerable efforthas been made by the scientific community for unraveling this geneticbasis of variable response to AEDs. However, there have beeninconsistencies in such genetic association studies conducted acrossdifferent territories of the world. There could be several reasonsunderlying the poor replicability of these studies, mainly nonuniformphenotypic definitions, poor sample size and interethnic variability. Inthe present review article, we provide an overview of heterogeneity instudy designs for conducting pharmacogenetic studies.

The problem,however, is difficult since HVAC systems are large in scale, consistingof many coupling subsystems, building and equipment dependent, andoperating under uncertain conditions. In this paper, a model-based anddata-driven method is presented for robust system-level fault detectionwith potential for large-scale implementation. It is a synergisticintegration of (1) Statistical Process Control (SPC) for measuring andanalyzing variations; (2) Kalman filtering based on gray-box models toprovide predictions and determine SPC control limits; and (3) systemanalysis for analyzing fault propagation. The method has been testedagainst a simulation model of a 420-meter-high building.

To the extent that women's lives and futures areinfluenced by childbirth, access to contraception and safe abortionservices is fundamental to gender equity. Yet many countries legallyrestrict access to safe abortion. In these countries, women with asocioeconomic advantage are more able to circumvent restrictive abortionlaws and access safe abortion services; poor and less educated women aremore likely to use unsafe methods and suffer serious morbidity anddeath. This is particularly egregious as deaths from unsafe abortion areentirely preventable, given access to modern contraception and safeabortion services. Bangladesh's Menstrual Regulation (MR) Programme isan example of a programme with the potential to reduce morbidity andmortality related to unsafe abortion in the context of a restrictiveabortion law. We describe how Bangladesh's MR Programme evolved from anurban-based relief effort in 1972 to a nationwide primary care-levelprogramme; review intersectoral processes that have and continue toinfluence policy development and programme implementation; assess theimpact of the programme; explore contextual factors that have influencedthe potential of the programme over time; and comment on issues ofprogramme sustainability and replicability in settings beyondBangladesh.

"," BMC Biology"," 9"," 19",NA," (23 March 2011)"," (23 March 2011)",NA," 2011"," 2011"," Background - Polyploidy is important from a phylogenetic perspectivebecause of its immense past impact on evolution and its potential futureimpact on diversification, survival and adaptation, especially inplants. Molecular population genetics studies of polyploid organismshave been difficult because of problems in sequencing multiple-copynuclear genes using Sanger sequencing. This paper describes a method forsequencing a barcoded mixture of targeted gene regions usingnext-generation sequencing methods to overcome these problems. Results -Using 64 3-bp barcodes, we successfully sequenced three chloroplast andtwo nuclear gene regions (each of which contained two gene copies withup to two alleles per individual) in a total of 60 individuals across 11species of Australian  Poa grasses. This method had high replicability,a low sequencing error rate (after appropriate quality control) and alow rate of missing data. Eighty-eight percent of the 320gene/individual combinations produced sequence reads, and >80% ofindividuals produced sufficient reads to detect all four possiblenuclear alleles of the homeologous nuclear loci with 95% probability. Weapplied this method to a group of sympatric Australian alpine  Poaspecies, which we discovered to share an allopolyploid ancestor with agroup of American  Poa species. All markers revealed extensive allelesharing among the Australian species and so we recommend that thecurrent taxonomy be re-examined. We also detected hypermutation in the trnH- psbA marker, suggesting it should not be used as a land plantbarcode region. Some markers indicated differentiation between Tasmanianand mainland samples. Significant positive spatial genetic structure wasdetected at <100 km with chloroplast but not nuclear markers, which maybe a result of restricted seed flow and long-distance pollen flow inthis wind-pollinated group. Conclusions - Our results demonstrate that454 sequencing of barcoded amplicon mixtures can be used to reliablysample all alleles of homeologous loci in polyploid species andsuccessfully investigate phylogenetic relationships among species, aswell as to investigate phylogeographic hypotheses. This next-generationsequencing method is more affordable than and at least as reliable asbacterial cloning. It could be applied to any experiment involvingsequencing of amplicon mixtures.

Secondly, they havenot connected the results of traditional aesthetics with design-relatedknowledge such as design philosophy, design methodology, and modelingprinciples. Thirdly, designers' practical usage of the traditions has atendency to repeat the visual appearances of traditions.

The characteristics ofthese researches show that design researchers had the intention ofstudying traditions, but the results of their researches indicate a lackof concreteness and thus are unable to be applied to the fields ofdesign practice. In other words, Korean design does not establish Koreandesign principles, design elements, and aesthetics with the requisitereplicability, universality, and science which would enable them to beapplied to educational sites and industrial sites of design. The aim ofthis study is to suggest a fundamentally alternative perspective ofcreative resources in the modern design atmosphere by using theaesthetics and formativeness of Korean traditional objects."," 0"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 1226-8046"," KJD:ART001583920",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA," 한국 디자인의 ‘전통’ 논의에 대한 연구"," 디자인학연구"," 본 연구는 한국 디자인계에서의 전통에 대한 연구경향을 살펴보고 있다. 이를 위해 전통에 대한 개별 연구자들의 시각을 담은단행본이나 비평, 디자인 전문지의 기획과 기사, 학회를 중심으로 한 학술 논문을 고찰하면서 그 특성을 분석하였다. 연구결과에의하면 한국 디자인에서 전통에 대한 연구의 흐름과 특성은 다음과 같다. 첫째, 많은 디자인 연구자들이 전통적 미학의 현대화라는당위성을 주장하고는 있지만 거대 담론의 단계에 머무르면서 구체적 실천의 단계를 위한 이론을 제공하지 못하고 있다. 둘째, 그간예술계와 미학, 철학자들의 연구 결과를 디자인 인식, 디자인 철학, 조형원리 등과 연관시켜 활용하지 못하고 있다. 셋째, 전통에대한 디자이너의 활용 방법은 시각적 표피의 재현 위주로 진행되고 있다. 넷째, 2000년대 들어 한국의 전통 논의가 사라지고아시아 미학으로 확대되어 논의되고 있다. 이러한 연구 성향의 특성은 전통에 대한 당위적 연구 의지는 있으나, 디자인 실천 영역에서활용할 수 있는 구체성을 결여하고 있다고 요약할 수 있다. 다시 말해서 디자인 교육 현장이나 산업 현장에서 사용할 수 있는반복가능하며 보편적인 한국적 조형원리나 조형요소, 미학의 정립이 미약하다는 현실을 보여준다는 것이다. 본 연구의 궁극적인 목표는한국 전통문화물에 드러난 미학과 조형성을 현대의 디자인 환경에서 창조적인 자원으로 활용할 수 있는 과학적 이론의 정립을 위한기초적인 전망을 제시하는데 있다.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Despitethe strong evidentiary link, little work has been done to determine whatprimary care health providers can do to address their patients' incomeas a risk to their health. This qualitative study explores the barriersto primary care responsiveness to poverty as a health issue in awell-resourced jurisdiction with near-universal health care insurancecoverage. Methods: One to one interviews were conducted with twelveexperts on poverty and health in primary care in Ontario, Canada.Participants included family physicians, specialist physicians, nursepractitioners, community workers, advocates, policy experts andresearchers. The interviews were analysed for anticipated and emergentthemes. Results: This study reveals provider- and patient-centredstructural, attitudinal, and knowledge-based barriers to addressingpoverty as a risk to health. While many of its findings reinforceprevious work in this area, this study's findings point to a number ofareas front line primary care providers could target to address theirpatients' poverty. These include a lack of provider understanding of thelived reality of poverty, leading to a failure to collect adequate dataabout patients' social circumstances, and to the development ofinappropriate care plans. Participants also pointed to prejudicialattitudes among providers, a failure of primary care disciplines toincorporate approaches to poverty as a standard of care, and a lack ofknowledge of concrete steps providers can take to address patients'poverty. Conclusions: While this study reinforces, in a well-resourcedjurisdiction such as Ontario, the previously reported existence ofsignificant barriers to addressing income as a health issue withinprimary care, the findings point to the possibility of front lineprimary care providers taking direct steps to address the health risksposed by poverty. The consistent direction and replicability of thesefindings point to a refocusing of the research agenda toward anexamination of interventions to decrease the health impacts of poverty."," 0"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 1471-2296"," CABI:20113246742",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Analysis of a number of variables(e.g., physical, behavioral, and cognitive) shows that fetal exposure tonicotine does not consistently cause growth retardation or decreasedbirth weight, nor reliably affect motor activity. But combined pre- andneonatal exposure is likely to result in delayed reflex development,global impairments in learning and memory, and an increased incidence ofsymptoms that model psychiatric illness.

Four genes (oculocutaneous albinism II (OCA2),tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1), dopachrome tautomerase (DCT), andKIT ligand (KITLG)) implicated in human skin-color variation, have shownevidence for positive selection in Europeans and East Asians in previousSNP-scan data. In the current study, we resequenced 4.7 to 6.7 kb of DNAfrom each of these genes in Africans, Europeans, East Asians, and SouthAsians.RESULTS: Applying all commonly used neutrality-test statistics forallele frequency distribution to the newly generated sequence dataprovided conflicting results regarding evidence for positive selection.Previous haplotype-based findings could not be clearly confirmed.Although some tests were marginally significant for some populations andgenes, none of them were significant after multiple-testing correction.Combined P values for each gene-population pair did not improve theseresults. Application of Approximate Bayesian Computation Markov chainMonte Carlo based to these sequence data using a simple forwardsimulator revealed broad posterior distributions of the selectiveparameters for all four genes, providing no support for positiveselection. However, when we applied this approach to published sequencedata on SLC45A2, another human pigmentation candidate gene, we couldreadily confirm evidence for positive selection, as previously detectedwith sequence-based and some haplotype-based tests.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our data indicate that even genes that are strongbiological candidates for positive selection and show reproduciblesignatures of positive selection in SNP scans do not always show thesame replicability of selection signals in other tests, which should beconsidered in future studies on detecting positive selection in geneticdata."," 4"," 4"," 0"," 0"," 4",NA," MEDLINE:22133426",NA,NA," 22133426",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Objectives: The present study has the objective oftranslating, adapting and validating the K-MPAI to the Portugueselanguage. Methods: After the written consent given by the author of theoriginal K-MPAI scale, the K-MPAI scale was translated and validated forPortuguese idiom. The Portuguese-version of K-MPAI was then applied to218 amateur and professional musicians of both genders. For theconcurrent validation, the validated Portuguese-version of the StateTrait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used. Results: Analysis of theinternal consistency demonstrated a Cronbach's alpha = 0.957, with p <0.001, replicated with p = 0.378 and the concurrent validation with theState Trait Anxiety Inventory, demonstrated a Cronbach's alpha = 0.642and p < 0.001. Discussion: The study allows evaluating data samples withhigh levels of reliability and replicability, which translates thisstudy based on an unbiased sample and replicable to other populations.The concurrent validation between K-MPAI and IDATE, allows inferringthat the scales are comparable in their capability of measuring anxietylevels in musicians."," 1"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 1"," 0101-6083"," WOS:000300072800001",NA,NA,NA," Gattaz, Wagner/C-4456-2012; Dias-Neto, Emmanuel/A-5869-2008",NA,NA,NA,NA," Dias-Neto, Emmanuel/0000-0001-5670-8559",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We argue that transition research, and future studies canbenefit from taking complexity theory seriously. In the paper, weelaborate four insights from complexity studies that can move theresearch agenda of transition studies forward: empirically investigatingthe degree of complexity of a system; investigating complexity at thelevel of the policy-making system; longitudinal and retrospectiveresearch designs for the identification of transitions; methodologicaltools which accommodate complexity, such as agent-based modeling andARIMA modeling.

Nevertheless,2.2% or less of the general population is genetically susceptible.Moreover, from the model, the number of susceptibility-loci that need tobe in a ""susceptible allelic state"" to produce MS-susceptibility issmall (11-18), whereas the total number of such susceptibility-loci islarge (50-200), and their ""frequency of susceptibility"" is low (i.e., <=0.12). The optimal solution to the model equations (which occurs when80% of the loci are recessive) predicts the epidemiological data quiteclosely.Conclusions: The model suggests that combinations of only a small numberof genetic loci in a ""susceptible allelic state"" produceMS-susceptibility. Nevertheless, genome-wide associations studies withhundreds of thousands of SNPs, are plagued by both false-positive andfalse-negative identifications and, consequently, emphasis has beenrightly placed on the replicability of findings. Nevertheless, becausegenome-wide screens don't distinguish between true susceptibility-lociand disease-modifying-loci, and because only true susceptibility-lociare constrained by the model, unraveling the two will not be possibleusing this approach. The model also suggests that HLA DRB1 may not be asuniquely important for MS-susceptibility as currently believed. Thus,this allele is only one among a hundred or more loci involved in MSsusceptibility. Even though the ""frequency of susceptibility"" at the HLADRB1 locus is four-fold that of other loci, the penetrance of thosesusceptible genotypes that include this allele is no different fromthose that don't. Also, almost 50% of genetically-susceptibleindividuals, lack this allele. Moreover, of those who have it, only asmall fraction (<= 5.2%) are even susceptible to getting MS."," 4"," 3"," 0"," 0"," 4"," 1471-2377"," WOS:000284765800001",NA,NA," 21029420",NA," 101",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Data was analyzed with ageneral linear model for repeated measures.RESULTS: Rats exposed to WA had higher number or pellets than controls:7.46 ± 0.45 (95%CI: 6.51, 8.41) vs. 2.88 ± 0.45 (1.93, 3.83), p < 0.001.The higher number of pellets was related to WA exposure as there were noother significant interactions. In both groups, the number of pelletswas higher during the first day and then decreased progressively.CONCLUSIONS: Chronic stress induced through WA in Wistar rats, exhibitsexternal validity as an experimental model for IBS research and ourfindings of increased number of fecal pellets coincide with theappearance hypermotility related to IBS. The model is optimum forresearch studies on this disorder."," 1"," 1"," 0"," 0"," 1"," 0375-0906"," MEDLINE:21169109",NA,NA," 21169109",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA," Validez externa de un modelo experimental para sindrome de intestinoirritable (SII) mediante estres cronico por evitacion al agua en ratasWistar.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Validation of the F-18-labeled PIB derivativeF-18-flutemetamol could significantly enhance access to this noveltechnology.Methods: Twenty-seven patients with early-stage clinically probableAlzheimer disease (AD), 20 with amnestic mild cognitive impairment(MCI), and 15 cognitively intact healthy volunteers (HVs) above and 10HVs below 55 years of age participated. The primary endpoint was theefficacy of blinded visual assessments of F-18-flutemetamol scans inassigning subjects to a raised versus normal uptake category, withclinical diagnosis as the standard of truth (SOT). As secondaryobjectives, we determined the correlation between the regionalstandardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) for F-18-flutemetamol and itsparent molecule C-11-PIB in 20 of the AD subjects and 20 of the MCIpatients. We also determined test-retest variability ofF-18-flutemetamol SUVRs in 5 of the AD subjects.Results: Blinded visual assessments of F-18-flutemetamol scans assigned25 of 27 scans from AD subjects and 1 of 15 scans from the elderly HVsto the raised category, corresponding to a sensitivity of 93.1% and aspecificity of 93.3% against the SOT. Correlation coefficients betweencortical F-18-flutemetamol SUVRs and C-11-PIB SUVRs ranged from 0.89 to0.92.

This review provides acomprehensive summary of these findings, and examines consistencies andtrends across studies in an effort to provide a perspective on ourcurrent state of understanding from this body of work. Results fromthese animal modeling studies clearly indicate that prenatal immuneactivation can cause both acute and lasting changes in behavior and CNSstructure and function in offspring. Across laboratories, studies varywith respect to the type, dose and timing of immunogen administrationduring gestation, species used, postnatal age examined and specificoutcome measure quantified. This makes comparison across studies andassessment of rep-licability difficult. With regard to mechanisms,evidence for roles for several acute mediators of effects of prenatalimmune activation has emerged, including circulating interleukin-6,increased placental cytokines and oxidative stress in the fetal brain.However, information required to describe the complete mechanisticpathway responsible for acute effects of prenatal immune activation onfetal brain is lacking, and no studies have yet addressed the issue ofhow acute prenatal exposure to an immunogen is transduced into along-term CNS change in the postnatal animal.

The following variables wereanalyzed: sociodemographic (age, sex, marital status, level ofschooling, and whether the subject lived alone), clinical (currentnumber of teeth, coronal and root caries, dental hygiene, and the use ofremovable prostheses and dentures), and self-perception (of the need fordental and general health care). The OHIP-Mx-49 value was calculated asthe sum of the scores in seven dimensions: functional limitation, pain,psychological discomfort, physical disability, psychological disability,social disability, and handicap. The internal consistency (Cronbach'salpha coefficient), replicability (intraclass correlation coefficient),and convergent and discriminant validity (Mann-Whitney andKruskal-Wallis tests) were assessed.Results. Of the 131 people interviewed (average age: 73.8 +/- 8.3years), 77.9% were women.

A numberof QTLs for root traits have been detected using different populationsin rice ( Oryza sativa L.), but rarely in wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.).The ""immortalized F 2"" population is favorable for QTL analysis due toits similar proportions of genotypes in the population, and thereplicability at multiple locations over several years. The objective ofthis study was to detect QTLs for several root traits at seedling stagein wheat. From a set of doubled haploid lines derived from Huapei 3 *Yumai 57, an ""immortalized F 2"" population was constructed with 168single crosses. Wheat seedlings were hydroponically cultured withHoagland's solution in a light incubator, and sampled when the fifthleaf emerged. Nine root traits including root total length, root surfacearea, root average diameter, root volume, root tips, maximum rootlength, shoot dry weight, root dry weight, and ratio of root dry weightto shoot dry weight per plant were measured using the WinRHIZO RootAnalysis System. QTLs associated with the nine traits were detectedusing composite interval mapping (CIM) method. A total of seven additiveQTLs and 12 pairs of epistatic QTLs were mapped on chromosomes 1A, 1D,2A, 2B, 2D, 3A, 3B, 5D, 6D, and 7D. Additive, dominant and epistaticeffects were observed across these QTLs, including the interactionsbetween additive and additive, additive and dominance, dominance andadditive, as well as dominance and dominance. The phenotypic variationexplained by each QTL ranged from 0.01% to 11.91%. In the intervalbetween  XWMC41 and  XBARC349.2 on chromosome 2D, a QTL for total rootlength and root dry weight was detected. Epistasis was of greatimportance in root growth and development at seedling stage in wheat.The results showed a complex mechanism on the genetics of root traits inwheat, and the eight root traits were significantly correlated with eachother. In marker-assisted breeding practice, several root traits shouldbe considered simultaneously for an integrated performance of roots withproper size and shape.

About 3.6 billion of the world's5.2 billion hectares of dryland used for agriculture have sufferederosion, soil degradation and salination. Desertification can also havea serious impact far beyond the borders of directly affected countries,can hinder efforts for sustainable development and introduces newthreats to human health, ecosystems and national economies. Forcedmigration and potential for inter-state conflict add to the urgency ofthis global problem. Therefore, solutions are desperately needed, suchas the improvement of drought and salinity tolerance of crops. A morerecent idea is to take advantage of the genetic potential of crops stillhave (Glenn et al., 1998). This idea requires to first identifyaccessions of a crop species showing enhanced drought and/or salttolerance. Another promising approach under discussion is to use (xero-)halophytes instead of glycophytic crops or to transfer genes fromhalophytes to regular crops to enhance their salt resistance. Halophytesgrow in a wide variety of saline habitats, from coastal regions, saltmarshes and mudflats to inland deserts, salt flats and steppes (ElShaer, 2003). Halophytes are introduced already at many sites tovalorize highly salinized zones and non-conventional water resourcessuch as waste water. However, the sustainable use of these plantsdepends under osmotic and ionic stress on the ability to exhibit a widerange of responses at molecular, cellular and whole plant levels. Thisincludes the synthesis of compatibles solutes/ osmolytes, specificproteins and radical scavenging mechanisms, ion uptake andcompartmentation of injurious ions. Acclimation of these plants tosalinity depends also upon activation of cascades of molecular networksinvolved to stress sensing, signal transduction and the expression ofspecific stress-related gene and metabolites. The product of these genesmay participate in the generation of regulatory molecules such as planthormones. The deeper understanding and replicability of thephysiological and biochemical basis of drought and salt resistance canprovide a basis for the cultivation of suitable plants in regionsthreatened by desertification and water scarcity sustainable cultureconditions. Even the drylands could offer tangible economic andecological opportunities. The aim of this chapter is to screen theresponses of halophytes with regard to drought and salt resistance toidentify early indicators allowing successful breeding (Koyro et al.,2009)."," 7"," 7"," 0"," 0"," 7"," 0065-2296"," WOS:000277633000004",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA," 978-0-12-380872-1",NA,NA,NA," Kader, JCDelseny, M"," Advances in Botanical Research",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Results: For the largemajority of cases (possibly all), MS develops, in part, because anindividual is genetically susceptible. Nevertheless, 2.2% or less of thegeneral population is genetically susceptible. Moreover, from the model,the number of susceptibility-loci that need to be in a ""susceptibleallelic state"" to produce MS-susceptibility is small (11-18), whereasthe total number of such susceptibility-loci is large (50-200), andtheir ""frequency of susceptibility"" is low (i.e., ≤0.12). The optimalsolution to the model equations (which occurs when 80% of the loci arerecessive) predicts the epidemiological data quite closely. Conclusions:The model suggests that combinations of only a small number of geneticloci in a ""susceptible allelic state"" produce MS-susceptibility.Nevertheless, genome-wide associations studies with hundreds ofthousands of SNPs, are plagued by both false-positive and false-negativeidentifications and, consequently, emphasis has been rightly placed onthe replicability of findings. Nevertheless, because genome-wide screensdon't distinguish between true susceptibility-loci anddisease-modifying-loci, and because only true susceptibility-loci areconstrained by the model, unraveling the two will not be possible usingthis approach. The model also suggests that HLA DRB1 may not be asuniquely important for MS-susceptibility as currently believed. Thus,this allele is only one among a hundred or more loci involved in MSsusceptibility. Even though the ""frequency of susceptibility"" at the HLADRB1 locus is four-fold that of other loci, the penetrance of thosesusceptible genotypes that include this allele is no different fromthose that don't. Also, almost 50% of genetically-susceptibleindividuals, lack this allele. Moreover, of those who have it, only asmall fraction ([less than or equal to] 5.2%) are even susceptible togetting MS."," 0"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 1471-2377"," CABI:20103357141",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Quality assessment tools (QAT) forassessing the study quality examine to what extent study results aresystematically distorted by confounding or bias (internal validity). Thetools can be divided into checklists, scales and component ratings.RESEARCH QUESTIONS: What QAT are available to assess the quality ofinterventional studies or studies in the field of health economics, howdo they differ from each other and what conclusions can be drawn fromthese results for quality assessments?METHODS: A systematic search of relevant databases from 1988 onwards isdone, supplemented by screening of the references, of the HTA reports ofthe German Agency for Health Technology Assessment (DAHTA) and aninternet search. The selection of relevant literature, the dataextraction and the quality assessment are carried out by two independentreviewers. The substantive elements of the QAT are extracted using amodified criteria list consisting of items and domains specific torandomized trials, observational studies, diagnostic studies, systematicreviews and health economic studies. Based on the number of covereditems and domains, more and less comprehensive QAT are distinguished. Inorder to exchange experiences regarding problems in the practicalapplication of tools, a workshop is hosted.RESULTS: A total of eight systematic methodological reviews isidentified as well as 147 QAT: 15 for systematic reviews, 80 forrandomized trials, 30 for observational studies, 17 for diagnosticstudies and 22 for health economic studies. The tools vary considerablywith regard to the content, the performance and quality ofoperationalisation. Some tools do not only include the items of internalvalidity but also the items of quality of reporting and externalvalidity. No tool covers all elements or domains. Design-specificgeneric tools are presented, which cover most of the content criteria.DISCUSSION: The evaluation of QAT by using content criteria isdifficult, because there is no scientific consensus on the necessaryelements of internal validity, and not all of the generally acceptedelements are based on empirical evidence. Comparing QAT with regard tocontents neglects the operationalisation of the respective parameters,for which the quality and precision are important for transparency,replicability, the correct assessment and interrater reliability. QAT,which mix items on the quality of reporting and internal validity,should be avoided.CONCLUSIONS: There are different, design-specific tools available whichcan be preferred for quality assessment, because of its wider coverageof substantive elements of internal validity. To minimise thesubjectivity of the assessment, tools with a detailed and preciseoperationalisation of the individual elements should be applied. Forhealth economic studies, tools should be developed and complemented withinstructions, which define the appropriateness of the criteria. Furtherresearch is needed to identify study characteristics that influence theinternal validity of studies."," 1"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 1",NA," MEDLINE:21289880",NA,NA," 21289880",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

As ithas been found that growth velocity may be decreased with GnRHatreatment, clinical trials with GnRHa combined with growth hormone (GH)have been carried out. In a recent study 46 adopted girls with early orprecocious puberty were randomly assigned to treatment with either GnRHaor GnRHa combined with GH, and followed to final height (FH). It wasfound that FH was significantly higher in the combined treatment group,158.9 compared with 155.8 cm in the GnRHa treated group. In order toselect the patients who could benefit from added GH, predictions of FHat the start of treatment according to the methods of bone agedetermination of Greulich-Pyle (GP) and Tanner-Whitehouse 2 (TW2) werecompared. It was found that the GP method was the most useful method forpatient selection. Recently, a revision of the Tanner-Whitehouse method,named Tanner-Whitehouse 3 (TW3), has been developed. The present studyexamined the useful-ness of the TW3 method in selecting suitablepatients for combined treatment. Method: The TW3 method bone agedeterminations of the 46 girls were compared to the GP and TW2 methoddeterminations, using the differences between actual FH and predictedadult height (PAH). Beside accuracy of prediction of FH, the criteria ofefficiency of selection and replicability were applied in thecomparison. Results: We found that the GP method, also when compared tothe TW3 method, gave the most accurate prediction of the FH on onlyGnRHa treatment. This gives the best ground for selection of patientswho can benefit from combined treatment. The GP method was also the mostefficient in selecting patients, i.e., it could select the least numberof patients that needed the combined treatment. The only drawback of theGP method was that it requires an experienced pediatric radiologist.Automated methods are being developed and may soon facilitate the use ofthe GP method for those less experienced. The FH after combinedtreatment could be predicted with an equation including PAH GP as wellas PAH TW3 as variables. Conclusion: The GP method remains the mostuseful method for selection of those patients who will benefit most fromthe addition of GH to GnRHa in the treatment of idiopathic centralprecocious or early puberty. FH prediction after combined treatmentrequires PAH GP as well as PAH TW3. Copyright (C) 2010 S.

Tests on dropout-weighted linear slope coefficients fittedto all of the available measurements for each participant were found toprovide superior power in the presence of compound symmetry (CS), buttests of significance applied to simple baseline-to-endpoint differencescores provided superior power in the presence of a stronglyautoregressive (AR) correlation structure.

Method: Theresearchers recorded the name and number of occurrences of journals thatappeared in the bibliographies of articles published in EAQ and JSL from2000 to 2007. The total counts for EAQ and JSL were combined to reach afinal count. All journals then were rank ordered according to frequency.Findings: Five main findings were noted in the current study. First, itwas found that authors who contribute to these journals tend toreference a different set of periodicals compared to those thatprofessors of educational leadership say they actually read. Second, twoof the leading journals (EAQ and JSL) in the field of educationalleadership may be reaching unique audiences. Third, of the top 25 citedjournals, slightly more than one third of the articles cited in EAQ andJSL from 2000 to 2007 were published in those two journals. Fourth, 4 ofthe top 15 most cited journals are practitioner journals. Finally, thefindings show where educational leadership authors should publish to gettheir work noticed by top scholars in the field. Conclusion: The currentstudy adds a valuable factor influencing authors' choices of journals inwhich to publish their work: a journal's citation frequency.

Methods: In experiment 1 consisting of four conditions with n =15 participants each (control, placebo, two double-blind groups, eachwith placebo only), we maximized the placebo effect through expectation.Effects were assessed with physiological (blood pressure, heart rate),psychomotor (response times), and well-being indicators (self-report).In experiment 2, caffeine was administered in one of the double-blindgroups, and another condition was added where caffeine was given openly.Results Effect sizes were medium to large for some outcome parameters inexperiment 1 and 2, showing partial replicability of the classicalplacebo effect. Although not formally significant, differences betweenthe double blind placebo conditions of the two experiments (with andwithout caffeine present) were medium to small. There was a significantdifference (p = 0.03) between experiment I and experiment 2 in thephysiological variables, and a near significant interaction effectbetween groups and experiments in the physiological variables (p =0.06).Conclusion The question warrants further scrutiny.

The motivation for this studywas to synthesize the results of this work. Published and unpublishedexperimental and quasi-experimental assessments were included in thissynthesis.PURPOSE (HYPOTHESIS)The fundamental hypotheses tested were whether a set of modulesinvolving challenge-based instruction and other course innovations,often involving advanced computer-based technologies, improved studentperformance in a variety of educational settings and studentpopulations, and whether improvements could be achieved by instructorsother than the developers of the innovations.DESIGN/METHODMeta-analysis of effects from thirty-three separate modules in fivecourses in bioengineering domains was undertaken, along with three casestudies.RESULTSResults from the experimental (randomized) and stronger-quasiexperimental studies revealed a weighted effect size of 0.655 (p <0.001). Studies using randomized designs produced smaller effects, andstudies using measures of transfer and adaptive expertise to indexoutcomes produced larger effects. Analyses also revealed that theresults can be replicated by instructors other than the developers ofthe modules, in a variety of student populations and educationalsettings, and at other institutions.CONCLUSIONSOverall, the challenge-based modules and other innovations have moderateoverall effects on improved student performance.

RESULTS: The authors reported theresults of a molecular study in 59 cases of gliomatosis cerebri,correlating these results with prognosis. The well-known prognosticfactors of gliomas (ie, age, Karnofsky performance status, histology[grade 2 vs 3], and contrast enhancement) were found to be predictive ofresponse or outcome in only a percentage of patients but not in allpatients. The authors identified a 23-gene signature that was able topredict patient prognosis with microarray gene expression profiling.With the aim of producing a prognosis too[ that is useful in clinicalinvestigation, the authors studied the expression of this 23-genesignature by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

The GTM are a panel of 'speedcongenic' mice consisting of over 60 strains spanning the entireautosomal genome. Each strain harbors a small (similar to 23 cM) DBA/2Jdonor segment on a uniform C57BL/6J background. The panel allows formapping to regions as small as 5 cM and provides a powerful new tool forincreasing mapping power and replicability in the analysis of QTLs. Atotal of 97 loci were mapped for a variety of complex behavioral traitsincluding hyperactivity, anxiety, prepulse inhibition, avoidance andconditional fear. A larger number of loci were recovered than generallyattained from standard mapping crosses. In addition, a surprisingly highproportion of loci, 63%, showed phenotypes unlike either of the parentalstrains. These data suggest that epistasis decreases sensitivity oflocus detection in traditional crosses and demonstrate the utility ofthe GTM for mapping complex behavioral traits with high sensitivity andprecision.

As the resources of Government are meager, housing programs canonly be sustained if aimed at full cost recovery. This study seeks tocontribute to a sustainable approach of affordable housing for the urbanpoor by reviewing existing housing situation and supply trend.

An iterative, multi-stage trajectory fordeveloping animal models and assessing their quality is proposed. Theprocess starts with defining the purpose(s) of the model, preferentiallybased on hypotheses about brain-behavior relationships. Then, the modelis developed and tested. The evaluation of the model takes scientificand ethical criteria into consideration.Model development requires a multidisciplinary approach. Preclinical andclinical experts should establish a set of scientific criteria, which amodel must meet. The scientific evaluation consists of assessing thereplicability/reliability, predictive, construct and externalvalidity/generalizability, and relevance of the model. We emphasize therole of (systematic and extended) replications in the course of thevalidation process. One may apply a multiple-tiered 'replicationbattery' to estimate the reliability/replicability, validity, andgeneralizability of result.Compromised welfare is inherent in many deficiency models in animals.Unfortunately, 'animal welfare' is a vaguely defined concept, making itdifficult to establish exact evaluation criteria. Weighing the animal'swelfare and considerations as to whether action is indicated to reducethe discomfort must accompany the scientific evaluation at any stage ofthe model building and evaluation process. Animal model building shouldbe discontinued if the model does not meet the preset scientificcriteria, or when animal welfare is severely compromised. Theapplication of the evaluation procedure is exemplified using the ratwith neonatal hippocampal lesion as a proposed model of schizophrenia.In a manner congruent to that for improving animal models, guided by theprocedure expounded upon in this paper, the developmental and evaluationprocedure itself may be improved by careful definition of the purpose(s)of a model and by defining better evaluation criteria, based on theproposed use of the model."," 51"," 44"," 1"," 0"," 53"," 1744-9081"," WOS:000265600900001",NA,NA," 19243583"," Nordquist, Rebecca/B-7455-2013"," 11",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The state,private and civil sectors have invested in numerous initiativesthroughout the length and breadth of India aimed at extending thebenefits of the information revolution to rural and remote areas. Theserange from Reliance Infocom's roll out of low-cost mobile cellularphones, to numerous civil society based initiatives aimed atestablishing affordable access to information and knowledge. The statecontinues to invest in ICTs for development - from its support forVillage Public Telephones (VPTs) to its enabling the computerisation ofland records such as the Bhoomi project in Karnataka. The state'srecognition of the role played by private and civil society sectors indevelopment marks a major and distinct change in attitude from onecharacterised by `tolerance' at best for these sectors and belief in theself-sufficiency of a `dirigiste' economy, to pragmatic accommodationswith these sectors. This change is to some extent a reflection ofpost-SAP policies adopted by the state, best illustrated by its steadywithdrawal of support from its welfare agenda. While the Bhoomi projectis primarily a state-based project, the Gyan Ganga project is a jointstate-private sector initiative aimed at the use of ICTs in development.Bhoomi, involves the digitalisation of all land records in Karnataka,and the provision of access to these records via information kiosks andfingerprint authentication systems. Gyan Ganga, is an ambitious projectaimed at the provision of information, connectivity, education, e-healthand e-governance broadly with in the parameters of the right toinformation, in the state of Gujarat. Whereas both projects have, atleast on paper, tremendous potential - in the case of Bhoomi, to bypasscorrupt land revenue officers and their power to control access to theserecords, and to bring some transparency in land revenue transactions andrecords, and in the case of Gyan Ganga to bring the multiple benefits ofthe information revolution to the rural masses, both projects, alongwith other similar ICTs for development projects in India, face a rangeof problems. These include issues related to replicability and contentprovision, but also a deeply rooted technological determinism thatassumes that the layering of ICTs in development will automaticallysolve the many issues related to the provision of `access' to thisinformation. In this article I argue that the inability to factor inreal-life contestations in the field, to deal with pre-existingconstraints related to gender, caste, feudalism, privilege andtraditional exercises of power, limits the real potential of ICTs indevelopment. I also argue that the right to information movement inIndia offers pointers towards making e-projects relevant and responsiveto people's real information and knowledge needs.

Five tissue preservation methods, two tissue typesand five extraction protocols were evaluated qualitatively,quantitatively and statistically. No significant differences amongtissues were observed, while there were differences in the preservationmethods and extraction protocols. Considering the cost/benefit relationand quantity of DNA, the most efficient protocols were six and nine,which used samples preserved in ethanol at -20 [degrees]C or with anextraction buffer without protease in non-cryogenic condition. For thatmatter, in optimal conditions (enough time, economic resources andcomplete infrastructure) is recommended to maintain 5-20mg of tissue incold ethanol (with a posterior cryogenic maintenance), coming with a DNAextraction made with P9 or an appropriate kit.

CCT programmes have been justified on the grounds thatdemand-side subsidies are necessary to address inequities in access tohealth and social services for poor people. In the past decade they havebecome increasingly popular, particularly in middle income countries inLatin America.ObjectivesTo assess the effectiveness of CCT in improving access to care andhealth outcomes, in particular for poorer populations in low and middleincome countries.Search strategyWe searched a wide range of international databases, including theCochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE andEMBASE, in addition to development studies and economic databases. Wealso searched the websites and online resources of numerousinternational agencies, organisations and universities to find relevantgrey literature. The original searches were conducted between November2005 and April 2006. An updated search in MEDLINE was carried out in May2009.Selection criteriaCCT were defined asmonetary transfers made to households on thecondition that they comply with some pre-determined requirements inrelation to health care. Studies had to include an objective measure ofat least one of the following outcomes: health care utilisation, healthexpenditure, health outcomes or equity outcomes. Eligible study designswere: randomised controlled trial, interrupted time series analysis, orcontrolled before-after study of the impact of health financing policiesfollowing criteria used by the Cochrane Effective Practice andOrganisation of Care Group. Data collection and analysis We performedqualitative analysis of the evidence.Main resultWe included ten papers reporting results from six intervention studies.Overall, design quality and analysis limited the risks of bias. SeveralCCT programmes provided strong evidence of a positive impact on the useof health services, nutritional status and health outcomes, respectivelyassessed by anthropometric measurements and self-reported episodes ofillness. It is hard to attribute these positive effects to the cashincentives specifically because other components may also contribute.Several studies provide evidence of positive impacts on the uptake ofpreventive services by children and pregnant women. We found no evidenceabout effects on health care expenditure.Authors' conclusionsConditional cash transfer programmes have been the subject of somewell-designed evaluations, which strongly suggest that they could be aneffective approach to improving access to preventive services. Theirreplicability under different conditions - particularly in more deprivedsettings - is still unclear because they depend on effective primaryhealth care and mechanisms to disburse payments. Further rigorousevaluative research is needed, particularly where CCTs are beingintroduced in low income countries, for example in Sub-Saharan Africa orSouth Asia."," 20"," 8"," 0"," 0"," 20"," 1469-493X"," WOS:000270687000060",NA,NA," 19821444",NA," CD008137",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While this hospital used to be a symbol ofhopelessness among patients and their families and an unspoken shameamong Taiwan psychiatry and mental health circles it now represents anexample of how an old, custodial hospital can be transformed into a verydifferent institution. In this case study we will describe the featuresof this transformation, which, over the past 20 years, has aimed to helpextended stay inpatients with severe mental illness to integrate intothe local community of Yuli even though it is not their original home.METHODS: Using historical documents and oral narratives from Yuliinhabitants, workers and patients of YVH, we will offer a case study ofthe Yuli model.RESULTS: There are four main components of the Yuli model: holisticmedical support, vocational rehabilitation, case management, and theresidential program. The four components help patients recover twoessential features of their lives: vocational life and ordinary dailyroutines. As the process of recovery evolves, patients gradually regaininner stability, dignity, self-confidence, and a sense of control. Thefour components are critical to rebuild the structure and order of lifeof the patients and are indispensable and interdependent parts of oneservice package. They operate simultaneously to benefit the patients tothe greatest degree possible.DISCUSSION: There are many challenges to the further development andfinancial viability of the model of services developed at YVH. There arealso important questions concerning the replicability of the Yuli modelin other sociocultural and service system contexts.CONCLUSION: This case study reveals the possibility of transforming acustodial mental hospital into a hospital providing high quality care.Hospital and community are not in opposition. They are part of acontinuum of care for the patients. We reinterpret and redefine theboundary and function of hospital and community, and thereby create anew service model, the Yuli Model, to help patients to reintegrate intothe community. The Yuli model, which particularly focuses on the needsof people with long-standing illness and prolonged hospital stay,illustrates one approach to linking hospital and community in a creativeand constructive manner."," 5"," 2"," 0"," 0"," 5",NA," MEDLINE:19121218",NA,NA," 19121218"," Cohen, Alex/A-6974-2009; Minas, Harry/F-7718-2010",NA,NA,NA,NA," Minas, Harry/0000-0003-1719-7367",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In 7 cases of cysts of the lateralcerebral fissure, cystocisternostomy with optic chiasm cistern, carotidartery cistern or prepontine cistern was performed. Six arachnoid cystslocated on the brain convexity were opened to the lateral ventricle bycystoventriculostomy. Because of the anatomical situation, in none ofthe cases was the communication wide enough to warrant long-termpotency, which was secured by use of a silicone elastomer catheter or aset of catheters. Results of the treatment were assessed based onpredefined clinical and radiological criteria The follow-up periodranged from 2.5 to 6 years.Results: Clinical condition improved in 11 patients (84.6%). In 12patients (92.3%) the size of the cyst decreased. Significant changesoccurred 6-12 months after the procedure.

This study aims at elucidating thisrelationship by using data from 456 bereaved young adults, aged 17 to 25years. We examined the structural distinctiveness of CG and NGreactions, using two criteria sets. The first set ties in with previousresearch in bereaved adults on the distinctiveness of CG and NG andallows to test the replicability of earlier findings. The second setlinks up with the recently revised criteria for CG and permits toinvestigate whether earlier findings hold for the new criteria. For bothsets, two models for NG and CG were compared using confirmatory factoranalytic procedures. These analyses revealed that CG and NG reactionscan be distinguished by their very nature, except for one CG reaction(viz. 'yearning'), that loaded on both factors.

The relation of childhoodpersonality to sexual risk taking during adolescence has been largelyunexplored.METHODS: Using data collected from participants in the Child Sample ofthe National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (CS-NLSY) when they were 5 or6 years of age (time 1) and 17 or 18 years of age (time 2), the relationof childhood personality to sexual risk taking during adolescence wasinvestigated. Maternal ratings of childhood personality were used toderive resiliency, undercontrol, and overcontrol prototypical profilescores for a diverse sample of 1219 child participants from the CS-NLSY.At time 2, participants reported whether they failed to use oralcontraception or condoms during their last sexual intercourse. Logisticregression models were used to investigate the association ofpersonality to sexual risk taking.RESULTS: Proximity to the overcontrolled personality prototype at time 1was associated with a decreased likelihood of sexual risk taking. Age,male gender, and childhood cognitive achievement were also significantpredictors of sexual risk taking.CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that children with personalityprofiles in which internalizing traits are more prominent are lesslikely than their peers to engage in sexual risk taking during lateadolescence. The findings of this study augment previous studies thatindicate that personality is an important predictor of development andunderscore the importance of conducting research into the processes bywhich personality influences health behavior."," 4"," 2"," 0"," 0"," 4"," 0022-4391"," WOS:000259909100006",NA,NA," 18844812",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The TDCS consists of three5-nt-long strands, the left (L) strand upstream of the translationinitiator AUG adjacent to the 5'-end of the genome, and the middle (M)and right (R) strands corresponding to the base of theFlavivirus-conserved 3' stem-loop structure near the 3'-end of the RNA.The three strands are arranged in an antiparallel configuration, withtwo sets of base-pairing interactions creating L-M and M-R duplexes.Disrupting either or both of these duplex regions of TDCS completelyabolished RNA replication, whereas reconstructing both duplex regions,albeit with mutated sequences, fully restored RNA replication. Modelingof replication-competent genomes recovered from a large pool ofpseudorevertants originating from six replication-incompetent TDCSmutants suggests that both duplex base-pairing potentials of TDCS arerequired for RNA replication. in all cases, acquisition of novelsequences within the 3' M-R duplex facilitated a long-range RNA-RNAinteraction of its 3'M strand with either the authentic 51 strand or itsalternative (invariably located upstream of the 5' initiator), therebyrestoring replicability.

World Psychiatry 6: 20-27.] claim for the ""beginning of theend for the Kraepelinian dichotomy"" on the basis of linkage andassociation is undermined by un-replicability of findings across studies(Crow, T.J. (2007) How and why genetic linkage has not solved theproblem of psychosis: review and hypothesis. American Journal ofPsychiatry, 164, 13-21). Absence of evidence of linkage is consistentwith the concept that the variation is epigerietic in form rather thanDNA sequence-based. But what are the dimensions that underly thecontinuum? The BBC Internet survey (Peters, M., Reimers, S., Manning,J.T. (2006) Hand preference for writing and associations with selecteddemographic and behavioral variables in 255, 100 subjects: the BBCinternet study. Brain and Cognition 62, 177-189), reinforces the conceptthat lateralisation is a major and sex-dependent dimension of humanvariation in verbal and spatial ability: twin studies indicate thatinter-individual variation in dominance for language is epigenetic andthe paternal age effect can be similarly explained. Thus an epigeneticimprint, arising in relation to the sapiens specific torque andpersisting over one or two generations is a better fit to the geneticsof the psychotic continuum than Craddock and Owen's elusive ""polygenic""variations.

A pneumaticallyactuated embossing facility with conventional IR heating was designed,constructed and tested in our laboratory. To mold micro-blocks onto theplastic plates, a silicon mold with an array of micro-block cavities wasfabricated by photolithography and deep reactive ion etching. During theembossing process, a PMMA plate was first placed above the mold. Aceramic IR heater was placed above the PMMA plate to heat the mold. TheIR passed through the transparent PMMA to reach and heat up the moldsurface. After retrieval of the IR heater, the pneumatically actuatedembossing facility pressed the plastic plate against the hot mastermold. A micro-block array was obtained. The effect of various processingparameters on the replicability of the micro-blocks was investigated.Under the proper processing conditions, the arrays of polymericmicro-blocks, with a dimension of 100 mu m x 80 mu m x 40 mu m, could besuccessfully fabricated. The experimental results in this study suggestthat IR heated embossing could provide an affective way of fabricatinglarge-area microstructures onto plastic plates.

To ensure interpretability and replicability of clinicalexperiments, methods must be adequately explicit and should elicit thesame decision from different clinicians who comply with the studyprotocol.Objective. The objective of this study was to determine whetherclinician compliance with protocol recommendations exceeds 90%.Design: We developed an adequately explicit computerized protocol(eProtocol-insulin) for managing critically ill adult patient bloodglucose. We monitored clinician compliance with eProtocol-insulinrecommendations in four intensive care units in four hospitals andcompared blood glucose distributions with those of a simple clinicalguideline at one hospital and a paper-based protocol at another. Allprotocols and the guideline used intravenous insulin and 80 to 110 mg/dL(4.4-6.1 mmol/L) blood glucose targets.Setting: The setting for this study was four academic hospital intensivecare units.Patients. This study included critically ill adults requiringintravenous insulin.Intervention. Intervention used in this study was a bedside computerizedprotocol for managing blood glucose.Main Outcome Measure. The main outcome measure was clinician compliancewith eProtocol-insulin recommendations.Results: The number of patients was 31 to 458 and the number of bloodglucose measurements was 2,226 to 19,925 among the four intensive careunits. Clinician compliance with eProtocol-insulin recommendations was91% to 98%. Blood glucose distributions were similar in the fourhospitals (generalized linear model p =.18). Compared with the simpleguideline, eProtocol-insulin glucose measurements within targetincreased from 21% to 39%, and mean blood glucose decreased from 142 to115 mg/dL (generalized linear model p <.001). Compared with thepaper-based protocol, eProtocol-insulin glucose measurements withintarget increased from 28% to 42%, and mean blood glucose decreased from134 to 116 mg/dL (generalized linear model P =.001).Conclusions. The 91% to 98% clinician compliance indicateseProtocol-insulin is an exportable instrument that can establish areplicable experimental method for clinical trials of blood glucosemanagement in critically ill adults. Control of blood glucose was betterwith eProtocol-insulin than with a simple clinical guideline or apaper-based protocol."," 35"," 8"," 1"," 0"," 36"," 0090-3493"," WOS:000256513000014",NA,NA," 18520641"," Li, Guoliang/D-8014-2012",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This phenomenon, known as the platelethyperserotonemia of autism, is considered to be one of the mostwell-replicated findings in biological psychiatry. Its replicabilitysuggests that many of the genes involved in autism affect a small numberof biological networks. These networks may also play a role in the earlydevelopment of the autistic brain.Results: We developed an equation that allows calculation of platelet5-HT concentration as a function of measurable biological parameters. Italso provides information about the sensitivity of platelet 5- HT levelsto each of the parameters and their interactions.Conclusion: The model yields platelet 5-HT concentrations that areconsistent with values reported in experimental studies. If theparameters are considered independent, the model predicts that platelet5-HT levels should be sensitive to changes in the platelet 5-HT uptakerate constant, the proportion of free 5-HT cleared in the liver andlungs, the gut 5-HT production rate and its regulation, and the volumeof the gut wall. Linear and non-linear interactions among these andother parameters are specified in the equation, which may facilitate thedesign and interpretation of experimental studies."," 11"," 11"," 0"," 0"," 12"," 1742-4682"," WOS:000265630200001",NA,NA," 18498654",NA," 10",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In addition, Suchey-Brooksphases V and VI are redefined. Phase definitions, decision-making rules,and comparison graphics for the new method are presented. Balkan (n =85) and Eastern Tennessee (n = 104) samples, totaling 189 individuals,were used in the analysis. Pearson correlation coefficients between fourobservers and a control seriation were strong, indicating ease ofreplicability between investigators. No statistically significantintra-observer error was detected. Summary statistics show thatindividuals in phase V were on average in the early 50s, whileindividuals in phase VI were in their mid 50s to mid 60s, andindividuals in phase VII were in their mid 70s.

Cronbach Alpha coefficients for the three subscaleswere respectively.89,.77 and.74. The rates for the Dys-Cyc-Anx were2.7%, and for the Irritable 3.1%. Despite the low rate of theHyperthymic temperament (.2%), nonetheless 16% were between Ist and 2ndSD. Exploratory factor analysis revealed a positive loading combiningDys-Cyc-Anx with the Irritable; the Hyperthymic loaded negatively onthis factor. In terms of dominant temperaments, based on z-scores, 2.7%were dysthymic, 1.7% cyclothymic,.7% hyperthymic, 3.5% irritable and 3%anxious. Limitation: Although developed for self-rated use, the Italianauthors nonetheless administered the TEMPS-A in an interview format. Itis uncertain in what ways this procedure could have influenced ourresults, if any. Another limitation is that we did not assesstest-retest reliability. Conclusions: These data,identify at least3-factors, Dys-Cyc-Anx and Irritable (which are correlated), andHyperthymic, which is uncorrelated with the others. Though our data arereminiscent of the neuroticism-extraversion distinction, importantlytraits are operationalized in affective terms. Beyond the well-knownrelationship between the Dysthymic and Cyclothymic subscales and thatbetween the Dysthymic and Anxious, the present data reveal a strongrelationship between the Cyclothymic and Anxious as well, which is ofgreat relevance for bipolar II. It is also provocative that much ofhyperthymia (16%) in the + SD is between the 1st and 2nd SD, thereby""normalizing"" this temperament in Italy, as previously reported byTEMPS-I (Pisa) from Northern Italy (and TEMPS-A from Lebanon andArgentina).

Acommon theme throughout many of these reasons is that p valuesexaggerate the evidence against H(0). This, in turn, calls into questionthe validity of much published work based on comparatively small,including.05, p values. Indeed, if researchers were fully informed aboutthe limitations of the p value as a measure of evidence, thisinferential index could not possibly enjoy its ongoing ubiquity.Replication with extension research focusing on sample statistics,effect sizes, and their confidence intervals is a better vehicle forreliable knowledge development than using p values.

A review of literature onparticipant description in aphasia research indicates a clear need forimprovement in the description of and control for visual acuity, colourperception, visual fields, visual attention, and ocular motor functions.Few authors control for or describe even basic aspects of vision.Aims: Strategic design of visual screening protocols is advocated.Appropriate selection of screening methods depends on specificassessment and experimental tasks to be administered in a given study.Researchers are encouraged to implement, and to describe in publishedreports, specific procedures to address visual acuity, colourperception, visual fields, visual attention, and ocular motor functions.Main Contribution: Visual characteristics are presented within aframework of (1) those that may be evaluated as part of a case historyand (2) those that may be directly screened by experimenters or assessedby collaborating professionals. Recommended screening procedures, andtheir relevance to various assessment and experimental tasks, aredescribed to assist researchers in strategically designing visualassessment protocols for future studies involving individuals withaphasia and related disorders.Conclusions: Improved assessment of visual function will improve thevalidity, quality, and replicability of research as well as readers'interpretations of published data and authors' conclusions. Formativefeedback concerning appropriate participant control and description iscritical for improving the peer review process for research publicationand funding. As training in visual assessment is not central to thetraining of most researchers in neurogenic communication disorders,further focus on this important issue within graduate programmes andcontinuing education curricula is needed."," 7"," 1"," 0"," 0"," 7"," 0268-7038"," WOS:000257086900002",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Honey has beenused since ancient times as a remedy in wound care. Evidence from animalstudies and some trials has suggested honey may accelerate woundhealing.ObjectivesThe objective was to determine whether honey increases the rate ofhealing in acute wounds ( burns, lacerations and other traumatic wounds)and chronic wounds ( venous ulcers, arterial ulcers, diabetic ulcers,pressure ulcers, infected surgical wounds).Search strategyWe searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register ( May 2008),CENTRAL ( May 2008) and several other electronic databases ( May 2008).Bibliographies were searched and manufacturers of dressing products werecontacted for unpublished trials.Selection criteriaRandomised and quasi randomised trials that evaluated honey as atreatment for any sort of acute or chronic wound were sought. There wasno restriction in terms of source, date of publication or language.Wound healing was the primary endpoint.Data collection and analysisData from eligible trials were extracted and summarised using a dataextraction sheet by one author and independently verified by a secondauthor.Main results19 trials ( n = 2554) were identified that met the inclusion criteria.In acute wounds, three trials evaluated the effect of honey in acutelacerations, abrasions or minor surgical wounds and nine trialsevaluated the effect the honey in burns. In chronic wounds two trialsevaluated the effect of honey in venous leg ulcers and one trial inpressure ulcers, infected post- operative wounds, and Fournier'sgangrene respectively. Two trials recruited people with mixed groups ofchronic or acute wounds. The poor quality of most of the trial reportsmeans the results should be interpreted with caution, except in venousleg ulcers. In acute wounds, honey may reduce time to healing comparedwith some conventional dressings in partial thickness burns ( WMD - 4.68days, 95% CI - 4.28 to - 5.09 days). All the included burns trials haveoriginated from a single centre, which may have impact on replicability.In chronic wounds, honey in addition to compression bandaging does notsignificantly increase healing in venous leg ulcers ( RR 1.15, 95% CI0.96 to 1.38). There is insufficient evidence to determine the effect ofhoney compared with other treatments for burns or in other acute orchronic wound types.Authors' conclusionsHoney may improve healing times in mild to moderate superficial andpartial thickness burns compared with some conventional dressings. Honeydressings as an adjuvant to compression do not significantly increaseleg ulcer healing at 12 weeks.

Moreover, domestic private equity funds will be complementaryto foreign private equity funds, not a substitute, at least for the timebeing. In arguing so, we will look into the investment experiences offoreign private equity funds and see how foreign private equity fundshave helped transform the economy in the post-financial crisis era. Wewill also look at the domestic private equity funds market to examinethe replicability of private equity-driven growth in Korea. The paperwill conclude with further recommendations for the growth of the privateequity market. In the past five years or so, Koreans have come to befamiliar with names such as Carlyle, Newbridge Capital, Lone Star, etc.These are the names of major foreign institutional investment firms thatbought out the Korean domestic banks, Koram Bank, Korea First Bank, andKorea Exchange Bank. Recently, with the incident of the Lone Starscandal disclosed in regards to its acquisition of Korea First Bank, theKorean media have given extensive coverage to the issues relating toprivate equity funds. Especially after the scandals involving foreigninvestors, there is public discontent about the large volume of foreignprivate equity funds, mainly in the financial sector, that seem to 'eatand run' once increased profits have been made. People have scrutinizedinvestments of this kind with critical eyes.  Nevertheless, we shouldacknowledge the contributions that the foreign private equity funds haveplayed in various sectors of the economy in the post-crisis period.Foreign funds have invested in troubled Korean firms, understanding anyrisks involved, and successfully turned them around for the better. Tothat end, even if domestic private equity funds that have been set upsince 2004 have not yet performed to the market expectation, we have tounderstand that they have further roles to play as we anticipate growthof the M&A market in the coming years."," 0"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 1226-8240"," KJD:ART001238194",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

After 20 days of elimination period, the lysosomaldestabilization and PAH body burdens decreased to 49% and 2,350 ng/g,respectively. Uptake rates of PAHs showed parabolic shaped correlationwith hydrophobicity (K-ow). Uptake rate constants of more hydrophobicPAHs (log K-ow > 4.6) had a negative correlation with K-ow, implyingthat hydrophobicity alone is not a satisfactory predictor for thesePAHs. Elimination half-lives varied from 4 to 96 days andbioconcentration factors ranged from 650 to 160,000. Fugacity ratios(f(o)/f(w)) indicated that equilibrium still was not reached at the endof the uptake period.

Outof a GWAS, we randomly grab handfuls of SNPs, modeling their effects ina multiple linear (or logistic) regression.

However, the SPARC model has not been tested incommunities elsewhere. In 2006, the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention facilitated a partnership between SPARC and the AgingServices division of the Atlanta Regional Commission to evaluate theprogram's replicability.METHODS: SPARC coalitions involving local public health agencies,hospitals, social service organizations, and advocacy groups wereestablished in two counties of the region, with the Atlanta RegionalCommission providing regional coordination. Using the SPARC model, thecoalitions planned, marketed, and implemented community-based activitiesto deliver adult screenings and vaccinations.CONSEQUENCES: During a 3-week pilot phase, SPARC clinics were held incentral Atlanta at three senior housing facilities, a local firestation, and a charter middle school, delivering 353 prevention servicesto 314 residents. In Fayette County, 634 people received influenzavaccinations on Election Day at SPARC clinics located near 10 pollingplaces.INTERPRETATION: The SPARC model provides a practical framework forimproving the community-wide delivery of disease prevention services.The model can galvanize local health services providers to developsuccessful locally tailored interventions, and the approach isapplicable in communities outside of SPARC's home region."," 11"," 8"," 0"," 0"," 11",NA," MEDLINE:18082009",NA,NA," 18082009",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, such spatially averaged measures neither offer hintsabout spatial variation in accuracy, nor are they useful for errorpropagation in derivatives due to the deficiency that spatial dependencyis not properly accommodated. Geostatistics provides a good frameworkfor spatial uncertainty characterization, as conditional simulation isdesigned for generating equal-probable realizations of often sparselysampled fields of concern, which can be summarized for error statisticsor subjected to particular geo-processing to facilitate errorpropagation. Often, for modeling errors in area-class maps depictingdistributions of spatial classes, stochastic indicator simulation isemployed. Unfortunately, indicator approaches suffer from non-invariantbehaviors in simulated classes as class labels are drawn from intervalsof class probabilities that are arbitrarily ordered. Discriminantspace-based models have been proposed to enhance consistency in mappingspatial classes and replicability in modeling spatial categoricaluncertainty. This paper explores bivariate (rather than univariate)discriminant models and extends uncertainty modeling from single-time tobi-temporal area-class maps. Experiment using simulated data sets wascarried out to quantify errors in area classes and their propagation inchange analysis.

In both methods different levels ofseed imbibition were established at 15°C. Before sowing in moistvermiculite, the seeds were air dried (25°C) for seven days. Submersedin water, seeds imbibed faster than between moist clothes, andreplicability of the imbibition curve was better with submersion.Without pre-imbibition germination was 75%. With pre-imbibition of about40% of seed moisture content (MC), 83% germination was assessed withseed submersion method (3 d) and 92% germination with the moist clothsmethod (6 d).

We sought evidence on: analytic performance oftests, clinical validity (i.e., prognostic accuracy and discrimination),clinical utility (i.e., prediction of treatment benefit), harms, impacton clinical decision making and health care costs.RESULTS: Few papers were found on the analytic validity of the OncotypeDX and MammaPrint tests, but these showed reasonable within-laboratoryreplicability. Pre-analytic issues related to sample storage andpreparation may play a larger role than within-laboratory variation. Forclinical validity, studies differed according to whether they examinedthe actual test that is currently being offered to patients or theunderlying gene signature. Almost all of the Oncotype DX evidence wasfor the marketed test, the strongest validation study being from one armof a randomized controlled trial (NSABP-14) with a clinicallyhomogeneous population. This study showed that the test, added in aclinically meaningful manner to standard prognostic indices. TheMammaPrint signature and test itself was examined in studies withclinically heterogeneous populations (e.g., mix of ER positivity andtamoxifen treatment) and showed a clinically relevant separation ofpatients into risk categories, but it was not clear exactly how manypredictions would be shifted across decision thresholds if this wereused in combination with traditional indices. The BCP test itself wasexamined in one study, and the signature was tested in a variety offormulations in several studies. One randomized controlled trialprovided high quality retrospective evidence of the clinical utility ofOncotype DX to predict chemotherapy treatment benefit, but evidence forclinical utility was not found for MammaPrint or the H/I ratio. Threedecision analyses examined the cost-effectiveness of breast cancer geneexpression assays, and overall were inconclusive.CONCLUSIONS: Oncotype DX is furthest along the validation pathway, withstrong retrospective evidence that it predicts distant spread andchemotherapy benefit to a clinically relevant extent over standardpredictors, in a well-defined clinical subgroup with clear treatmentimplications. The evidence for clinical implications of using MammaPrintwas not as clear as with Oncotype DX, and the ability to predictchemotherapy benefit does not yet exist. The H/I ratio test requiresfurther validation. For all tests, the relationship of predicted toobserved risk in different populations still needs further study, asdoes their incremental contribution, optimal implementation, andrelevance to patients on current therapies."," 6"," 4"," 0"," 0"," 6"," 1530-4396"," MEDLINE:18457476",NA,NA," 18457476",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Mesocosm physicochemistry was highly replicable, with statisticallysignificant congruence in temporal variation across the mesocosm series,low spatial variation and no significant blocking or positional effectsarising from mesocosm layout.

Both benthic and drifting assemblages were comparableamong mesocosms, with no significant effect of mesocosm layout.

Therefore, the G4 ligand RHPS4 maypossess antitumor activity. Here, we show that RHPS4 triggers a rapidand potent DNA damage response at telomeres in human transformedfibroblasts and melanoma cells, characterized by the formation ofseveral telomeric foci containing phosphorylated DNA damage responsefactors gamma-H2AX, RAD17, and 53BP1. This was dependent on DNA repairenzyme ATR, correlated with delocalization of the protective telomericDNA-binding protein POT1, and was antagonized by overexpression of POT1or TRF2. In mice, RHPS4 exerted its antitumor effect on xenografts ofhuman tumor cells of different histotype by telomere injury and tumorcell apoptosis. Tumor inhibition was accompanied by a strong DNA damageresponse, and tumors overexpressing POT1 or TRF2 were resistant to RHPS4treatment. These data provide evidence that RHPS4 is a telomere damageinducer and that telomere disruption selectively triggered in malignantcells results in a high therapeutic index in mice. They also define afunctional link between telomere damage and antitumor activity andreveal the key role of telomere-protective factors TRF2 and POT1 inresponse to this anti-telomere strategy."," 107"," 88"," 2"," 0"," 110"," 0021-9738"," WOS:000250676000017",NA,NA," 17932567",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

They had 19 synaesthetes choose colorsfor spoken digits and letters from a digital color palette. The colorswere quantified in terms of their hue, saturation, and luminance (theHSL color system). The results showed (a) that the luminance ofsynaesthetic colors increased with the frequency of digits in everydaylanguage and (b) that the saturation of synaesthetic colors increasedwith increased letter and digit frequency. These findings indicate thatthere is a relation between how graphemes are encountered ( and perhapslearned) in language and the basic qualities of synaesthetic colorexperiences.

This finding seems to be explained bya genetically-determined heterogeneity for the protective effect ofmicrobial exposure on allergic phenotypes, with homozygotes for theC-allele showing a much stronger negative association between exposureand allergic outcomes than carries of the other two genotypes.

Debates about the modifiability of cognitive ability havebeen largely resolved by reports of successful 'thinking skills'interventions. However, such interventions are very diverse andgeneralization of effects relatively little explored.Aims. This study investigated whether a thinking skills interventioninvolving collaborative interactive dialogue could lead not only togains in measured verbal cognitive ability but also generalization tonon-verbal and quantitative reasoning ability.Sample. Randomly selected intervention children were aged 10 at pre-test(N = 105, four classes/schools). Controls followed a normal curriculum(N = 72, three classes/two schools).Method.

Intervention pupils showed significant standardized gains inverbal and also in non-verbal and quantitative aspects of reasoning,consistent across intervention schools. Boys and girls made significantgains. The highest quartile of pre-test ability showed the smallestgains. Controls did not gain in any aspect.Conclusions. Philosophical enquiry involving interactive dialogue lednot only to significant gains in measured verbal cognitive ability butalso generalization to nonverbal and quantitative reasoning ability,consistent across schools and largely irrespective of pupil gender andability.

Conventionally, lineage-specificdifferentiation of hESCs is achieved through supplementation of variouscytokines and chemical factors within the culture milieu. Nevertheless,this is a highly inefficient approach that is often limited by poorreplicability. An alternative is through genetic modulation withrecombinant DNA. Hence, this study investigated whether transduction ofhESCs with an adenoviral vector expressing the human VEGF(165) gene(Ad-hVEGF(165)) can enhance endothelial-lineage differentiation. ThehESCs were induced to form embryoid bodies (EBs) by culturing themwithin low-attachment plates for 7 days, and were subsequentlytrypsinized into single cells, prior to transduction with Ad-hVEGF165.Optimal transduction efficiency with high cell viability was achieved by4-h exposure of the differentiating hESCs to viral particles at a ratioof I : 500 for three consecutive days. ELISA results showed thatAd-hVEGF(165)-transduced cells secreted human vascular endothelialgrowth factor (hVEGF) for more than 30 days post-transduction, peakingon day 8, and the conditioned medium from the transduced cellsstimulated extensive proliferation of HUVEC. Real-time PCR analysisshowed positive upregulation of VEGF, Ang-1, Flt-1, Tie-2, CD34, CD31,CD133 and Flk-1 gene expression in Ad-hVEGF165-transduced cells.Additionally, flow cytometric analysis of CD133 cell surface markerrevealed an approximately 5-fold increase in CD133 marker expression inAd-hVEGF165-transduced cells compared to the non-transduced control.Hence, this study demonstrated that transduction of differentiatinghESCs with Ad-hVEGF165 facilitated expression of the VEGF transgene,which in turn significantly enhanced endothelial differentiation ofhESCs.

The proportion of positive agreement and of negative agreementwas 86.3% and 43.5%, respectively.Conclusions. The sensitivity of the presumptive diagnosis carried out bythe health workers surpasses that of the parasitological diagnosticmethods generally used in the three endemic areas, but its specificityis much lower. Even though this approach is not useful as a diagnostictest for cutaneous leishmaniasis or as a criterion for deciding toproceed with treatment or not., the method is useful for the activeidentification of cases in the community."," 0"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 1020-4989"," WOS:000249207300001",NA,NA," 17761045",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our goal was to determine if multiple courses of antenatalbetamethasone affect auditory neural maturation in 28 to 32 weeks'gestational age infants.PATIENTS AND METHODS. A retrospective cohort study was performed tocompare auditory neural maturation between premature infants exposed to1 course of betamethasone and infants exposed to >= 2 courses ofbetamethasone. Inclusion criteria included all 28 to 32 weeks'gestational age infants delivered between July 1996 and December 1998who had auditory brainstem response testing performed ( 80- dB clickstimuli at a repetition rate of 39.9/ second) within 24 hours ofpostnatal life as part of bilirubin- auditory studies. Infants withtoxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes infections, chromosomaldisorders, unstable conditions, exposure to antenatal dexamethasone, andexposure to < 1 complete course of betamethasone were excluded. Auditorywaveforms were categorized into response types on response replicabilityand peak identification as types 1 through 4 ( type 1 indicating mostmature). Absolute and interpeak wave latencies were measured whenapplicable. Categorical and continuous variables were analyzed by usingthe chi(2) test and Student's t test, respectively.RESULTS. Of 174 infants studied, 123 received antenatal steroids. Ofthese, 50 received 1 course and 29 received >= 2 courses ofbetamethasone. There were no significant differences in perinataldemographics between the 2 groups. After controlling for confoundingvariables, there was no significant difference in mean absolute wavelatencies, mean interpeak latencies, or distribution of response typebetween the 2 groups. There also was no significant difference in anyauditory brainstem response parameters between infants exposed to 1course of betamethasone ( n = 50) and infants exposed to > 2 courses ofbetamethasone ( n = 17).CONCLUSION. Compared with a single recommended course of antenatalsteroids, multiple courses of antenatal betamethasone are not associatedwith a deleterious effect on auditory neural maturation in 28 to 32weeks' gestational age infants."," 15"," 11"," 0"," 0"," 15"," 0031-4005"," WOS:000244579800010",NA,NA," 17332203",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Previous studies have suggested a considerable variation inthe monocytic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated TF antigen levels andprocoagulant activities between different individuals. Our aim with thepresent study was to investigate the replicability of LPS induced TFmRNA production in a series of standardised experiments with the purposeto identify putative factors influencing the TF high and low response.Results: A constant and reproducible production of LPS induced TF mRNAwas identified in five high responders and three low responders (out of42 individuals) and followed-up in three subsequent experimentsperformed over 2 years. The LPS induced TF mRNA production correlatedwith the corresponding expressions of interleukin-8, tumor necrosisfactor-alfa and interleukin-1 beta, indicating a common pathway with theTF high and low response. A strong and significant correlation betweenthe LPS induced TF and toll-like receptor 4 mRNA expressions wassubsequently identified and replicated.Conclusions: We demonstrated a high and low responder phenomenon of LPSinduced TF mRNA in human monocytes. The production of toll-like receptor4 mRNA was significantly enhanced in TF high responders. (c) 2006Elsevier Ltd.

Consumer relevance and demands on servicesystems and practices are influencing how mental health care isdelivered and how, systems will be shaped in the future.Aims of the Study: The present report seeks to assemble a confluence ofconsumer-driven themes from noteworthy reports on the state of themental health system in the U.S. It also explores innovative efforts,promising practices, collaborative efforts, as well as identification ofbarriers to consumer-directed care, with possible solutions.Method: The report reviews the relevant public mental health policy anddata used in published work.Results: The findings indicate an increasing public and private interestin promoting consumer-driven care, even though historical systems ofcare predominate, and often create, barriers to widespread redesign of aconsumer-c entered mental health care system. Innovative consumer-drivenpractices are increasing as quality, choice, and self-determinationbecome integral parts of a redesigned U.S. mental health care system.Discussion and Limitations: The use of consumer-driven approaches inmental health is limited at best. These programs challenge industrynorms and traditional practices. Limitations include the need foradditional and thorough evaluations of effectiveness (cost and clinical)and replicability of consumer-directed programs.Implications for Health Care Provision and Use: Consumer-driven servicesindicate that mental health consumers are expecting to be moreparticipative in their mental health care. This expectation willinfluence how traditional mental health services and providers becomemore consumer-centric and meet the demand.Implications for Health Policies: Public and private interest inconsumer-driven health care range from creating cost-conscious consumersto individualized control of recovery. The health care sector shouldseek to invest more resources in the provision of consumer-driven healthcare programs.

The study analyzes howthe governments of both countries have responded to the policiespromoted under the two approaches. Data on government policies areanalyzed to find out whether the governments of Kenya and the DominicanRepublic have provided an enabling environment for other actors. Thisstudy reveals that both governments have adopted enabling policies intheir National Action Plans which include: facilitating the efforts ofall actors in providing shelter; the use of non-conventional buildingmaterials; and the upgrading of low-income housing.

The importance of a shift toward agricultural systems,which are more complex in terms of biodiversity in emerging countriessuch as China, where most of the population (about 70%) lives in ruralareas, in poor conditions and still relies on agriculture as the mainsource of income is discussed. In China the risk of shifting to moreintensive and polluting agricultural production patterns to address thedemand for food of the growing population and the need of higher incomesof rural communities is relatively high. With the present Chineseeconomic growth, urbanization and increased leisure time, tourism andrecreation activities in rural areas are also increasing. Additionally,in the restructuring process of economy in rural areas, one of the mostobvious effects is the necessity to create job opportunities alternativeto agricultural sector. The role of sustainable agriculture forenvironment protection in a country such as China is highlighted. Theattention paid to activities in the agro-environmental sector has beenincreasing over the years in this country due to the high social andeconomic priority attached by the Chinese authorities to themodernization of agriculture that must be pursued in a sustainablemanner, addressing at once food security, environment protection,economic development and good management of natural resources.

To obtain direct evidence of the extent to which extractedorganic N is mineralizable, the extraction suspension was furtherincubated immediately after the extraction procedure with mild andselective extractants. In this 'extraction incubation' method,extraction continues during the incubation but only relatively easilymineralizable organic matter is released. Standard incubation is usuallycarried out in sealed N-2-flushed bottles. However, when phosphate orpyrophosphate soil suspensions are incubated, mineralization is muchhigher than in soil water suspensions. Further, accumulation of ammonia+ (ammonium) and other gases, i.e. CO2, can affect the reaction rate andfinal reaction equilibrium in the sealed incubation flask. It was toavoid these effects that the membrane method was developed. With thisprocedure, the flask is closed with an ammonia-absorbing membranepermeable to other gases. Water, phosphate and pyrophosphate suspensionswere incubated at 37 degrees C in sealed bottles (SB), in sealed N-2gas-flushed bottles (SBN2), and in bottles with ammonia-trapping filters(MB). The maximum amount of NH4+ - N released during 10 days' incubationwas 133.0 mg kg(-1) in the water, 208.0 mg kg(-1) in the phosphate and454.1 mg kg(-1) in the pyrophosphate suspension (soil total C content6.2% and N 0.25%). During incubation in phosphate and pyrophosphatesuspensions, the mobilization was nearly linear in membrane bottles. Thevariation between replicates was also smallest in these bottles. It wasconcluded that membrane bottles were best suited to incubation whenmobilization reactions were accelerated with phosphate or pyrophosphateextractants.

A previous genome-wide screen with the yeastsingle-gene deletion library of 4,848 strains, representing similar to80% of all genes of yeast, led to the identification of 11 host genesaffecting RNA recombination in Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV), a smallmodel plant virus (E.

To further test the role of host genes in viralRNA recombination, in this paper, we extended the screening to 800essential yeast genes present in the yeast Tet-promoters HughesCollection (yTHC). In total, we identified 16 new host genes that eitherincreased or decreased the ratio of TBSV recombinants to thenonrecombined TBSV RNA. The identified essential yeast genes areinvolved in RNA transcription/metabolism, in proteinmetabolism/transport, or unknown cellular processes. Detailed analysisof the effect of the identified yeast genes revealed that they mightaffect RNA recombination by altering (i) the ratio of the two viralreplication proteins, (ii) the stability of the viral RNA, and/or (iii)the replicability of the recombinant RNAs. Overall, this and previousworks firmly establish that a set of essential and nonessential hostgenes could affect TBSV recombination and evolution."," 61"," 63"," 0"," 0"," 64"," 0022-538X"," WOS:000234871400017",NA,NA," 16415000",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the adequate application of this system requiresstrengthening the institutional framework to achieve the integratedmanagement and sustainable use of water. In addition, it can beconcluded that the performance of the water use rights market in Chilehas been variable. The variability in performance of the market can beexplained by problems both related to and independent of the allocationsystem. The most important problems independent of the water allocationmechanism are those arising as a result of unavoidable transactioncosts, externalities due to inadequate definition of use rights in theWater Code, and uncertainty regarding the availability of water.Likewise, certain problems related to the allocation system have beenidentified, viz., the lack of adequate and timely information; thedifference between nominal and in rem (latin term used to describejurisdiction over property without regard to personal jurisdiction)rights; conflicts arising between users due to the sale of traditionalrights; unavoidable transaction costs; and the hoarding ofnon-consumptive rights.

In 1998, a review of severalof the ELF EMF human biological interaction mechanisms regarding fieldintensities and frequencies was presented to the Australian RadiationLaboratory of Commonwealth Department of Community Services and Healthin 1988 by Andrew W. Wood. Wood's 1988 assertion of the importance ofunderstanding the interaction mechanisms did not alter even after adecade when the NIEHS RAPID (http://ww-w.niehs.nih.gov/) gathering ofworld experts produced their statement, in which quoted, there have beenexperiments on possible mechanism/s in support or refutation of thevarious proposals however none were replicated. Valberg (Valberg et al.,1997) also summed up some but failed to include all the claimed proposedmechanisms at the time.This paper is to present a complete list of the allegedly possibleinteraction mechanisms to date. This paper will also report on anacademic research on computer modeling of biological effects of ELF EMFusing one of the proposed mechanisms. The research reported here hasgenerally aimed at modeling the proposals using computer. The initialphase of this effort has concentrated on Ca effect as the number ofpublications referencing that was considerable. Calcium is a key elementin the biological performance of every organ in the human body. Thus itdeemed imperative to study the effect of EMF on Ca channels of a livingcell.Furthermore, considerations for setting standards in EMF experimentalresearch protocols are recommended. Developing a standard protocolallows results of future experiments to be comparable; and, the chanceof replicability in EMF-health improve, which this aspect hasindisputably been absent in EMF research projects thus far. Replicationis desirable mainly because it eliminates bias, artifact and systematicerrors. Replication is almost impossible in the case of epidemiologicalstudies however in experimentation is possible if the details arespecified in full.

Forexample, the calculation of summary measures of population health (SMPH)can be compromised if co-morbidity is not taken into account. Onepopular co-morbidity adjustment used in SMPH computations relies on astraightforward multiplicative combination of the severity weights forthe individual conditions involved. While the convenience and simplicityof the multiplicative model are attractive, its appropriateness has yetto be formally tested. The primary objective of the current study wastherefore to examine the empirical evidence in support of this approach.METHODS: The present study drew on information on the prevalence ofchronic conditions and a utility-based measure of health-related qualityof life (HRQoL), namely the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3),available from Cycle 1.1 of the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS;2000-01). Average HUI3 scores were computed for both single andco-morbid conditions, and were also purified by statistically removingthe loss of functional health due to health problems other than thechronic conditions reported. The co-morbidity rule was specified as amultiplicative combination of the purified average observed HUI3 utilityscores for the individual conditions involved, with the addition of asynergy coefficient s for capturing any interaction between theconditions not explained by the product of their utilities. The fit ofthe model to the purified average observed utilities for the co-morbidconditions was optimized using ordinary least squares regression toestimate s. Replicability of the results was assessed by applying themethod to triple co-morbidities from the CCHS cycle 1.1 database, aswell as to double and triple co-morbidities from cycle 2.1 of the CCHS(2003-04).RESULTS: Model fit was optimized at s = .99 (i.e., essentially astraightforward multiplicative model). These results were closelyreplicated with triple co-morbidities reported on CCHS 2000-01, as wellas with double and triple co-morbidities reported on CCHS 2003-04.CONCLUSION: The findings support the simple multiplicative model forcomputing utilities for co-morbid conditions from the utilities for theindividual conditions involved. Future work using a wider variety ofconditions and data sources could serve to further evaluate and refinethe approach."," 20"," 3"," 0"," 0"," 20",NA," MEDLINE:17076901",NA,NA," 17076901",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

DIL and TdR VP methods gave more realisticestimates of VMM with respect to BP. The FLV method provides estimatesof both VP and virus removal rates; however, it requires preparation ofa viral tracer and twice as many microscopic enumerations as the DILmethod. DIL was the least difficult and most efficient method; however,bacterial loss during vacuum diafiltration resulted in poorreplicability. TdR gave similar VP estimates to DIL, but requires use ofa large and poorly constrained conversion factor.

Here, we demonstrate thesuccessful extraction of DNA, and subsequent sequencing of themitochondrial 12S gene, from dried snake venoms. This approach offers anew and potentially straightforward method for accurate speciesidentification. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences isolated from snakevenom can be used to clarify or validate snake species identificationthrough comparison against existing sequences in the GenBank database,and through phylogenetic analyses with other sequences. Pooled venomscan also be screened a priori for the presence of multiple species, andthe species names on the labels of commercial venoms verified. Moreover,if the species from which the venom sample has been taken is known, andthe specimen is available as a voucher, the mtDNA sequence of thehaplotype isolated from that species venom sample could serve as asequence standard (or 'DNA barcode') for that species. Our new method ofDNA barcoding venoms ensures the identification of venoms even afterfuture taxonomic changes. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The database included mouseopen-field behavior assessed in 3 laboratories, 7 inbred strains,several pharmacological treatments and hundreds of animals. The newbehavioral measure, 'path texture', was characterized using the localcurvature of the path (the change of direction per unit distance, indegrees/cm) across several spatial scales, starting from scales smallerthan the animal's body length and up to the scale of the arena size.Path texture analysis differs from fractal dimension analysis in that itdoes not assume self-similarity across scales. Path texture was found todiscriminate inbred strains with relatively high broad-senseheritability (43%-71%) and high replicability across laboratories. Evengenotypes that had similar path curvatures in some scales usuallydiffered in other scales, and self-similarity across scales was notdisplayed by all genotypes. Amphetamine decreased the path curvature ofC57BL/6 mice in small and medium scales, while having no effect onDBA/2J mice. Diazepam close-dependently decreased the curvature ofC57BL/6 mice across all scales, while 2 anxiogenic drugs, FG-7142 andpentylenetetrazole, increased it.

We compared modelpredictions with experimental results obtained in our laboratory in thewhole phase parameter space, for acoustic pressures from the bubbledissolution limit up to bubble extinction. The effects were taken intoaccount simultaneously to consider the transition fromnonsonoluminescence to sonoluminescence bubbles. The model includes (1)inside the bubble, transient and spatially nonuniform heat transferusing a collocation points method, dissociation of O-2 and N-2, and massdiffusion of vapor in the noncondensable gases; (2) at the bubbleinterface, nonequilibrium evaporation and condensation of water and atemperature jump due to the accommodation coefficient; (3) in theliquid, transient and spatially nonuniform heat transfer using acollocation points method, and mass diffusion of the gas in the liquid.The model is completed with a Rayleigh-Plesset equation with liquidcompressible terms and vapor mass transfer. We computed the boundary forthe shape instability based on the temporal evolution of the computedradius. The model is valid for an arbitrary number of dissociable gasesdissolved in the liquid. We also obtained absolute measurements for R(t)using two photodetectors and Mie scattering calculations. The robusttechnique used allows the estimation of experimental results of absoluteR-0 and P-a. The technique is based on identifying the bubbledissolution limit coincident with the parametric instability in(P-a,R-0) parameter space. We take advantage of the fact that this pointcan be determined experimentally with high precision and replicability.We computed the equilibrium concentration of the different gaseousspecies and water vapor during collapse as a function of P-a and R-0.The model obtains from first principles the result that insonoluminescence the bubble is practically 100% argon for air dissolvedin water. Therefore, the dissociation reactions in air bubbles must betaken into account for quantitative computations of maximumtemperatures. The agreement found between the numerical and experimentaldata is very good in the whole parameter space explored. We do not fitany parameter in the model.

It has been notedthat a replicable classification is not necessarily a useful one, but auseful one that characterizes some aspect of the population must bereplicable. By replicable we mean reproducible across multiple samplingsfrom the same population. Methodologists have suggested that thevalidity of clustering methods should be based on classifications thatyield reproducible findings beyond chance levels. We used this approachto determine the performance of commonly used clustering algorithms andthe degree of replicability achieved using several microarray datasets.Methods: We considered four commonly used iterative partitioningalgorithms ( Self Organizing Maps (SOM), K-means, Clutsering LARgeApplications (CLARA), and Fuzzy C-means) and evaluated theirperformances on 37 microarray datasets, with sample sizes ranging from12 to 172. We assessed reproducibility of the clustering algorithm bymeasuring the strength of relationship between clustering outputs ofsubsamples of 37 datasets. Cluster stability was quantified usingCramer's v(2) from a kXk table. Cramer's v(2) is equivalent to thesquared canonical correlation coefficient between two sets of nominalvariables. Potential scores range from 0 to 1, with 1 denoting perfectreproducibility.Results: All four clustering routines show increased stability withlarger sample sizes. K-means and SOM showed a gradual increase instability with increasing sample size. CLARA and Fuzzy C-means, however,yielded low stability scores until sample sizes approached 30 and thengradually increased thereafter. Average stability never exceeded 0.55for the four clustering routines, even at a sample size of 50. Thesefindings suggest several plausible scenarios: ( 1) microarray datasetslack natural clustering structure thereby producing low stability scoreson all four methods; ( 2) the algorithms studied do not produce reliableresults and/or ( 3) sample sizes typically used in microarray researchmay be too small to support derivation of reliable clustering results.Further research should be directed towards evaluating stabilityperformances of more clustering algorithms on more datasets speciallyhaving larger sample sizes with larger numbers of clusters considered."," 24"," 21"," 0"," 0"," 25"," 1471-2105"," WOS:000236061500010",NA," 2"," 16026595",NA," S10",NA,NA,NA,NA," 2nd Annual Conference of theMidSouth-Computational-Biology-and-Bioinformatics-Society"," OCT 07-09, 2004"," Little Rock, AR"," MidSouth Computat Biol & Bioinformat Soc",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The effects of two types of psychological stresstests, the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and a stress imagery test, onpsychological, physiological, and hormonal responses (salivary cortisoland DHEA) were examined when each test was given twice to cocaine- ormethamphetamine-dependent human subjects, 24 of whom completed at leastone session. The stress imagery test produced significant changes inseveral of the subjective response measures in both first and secondsessions, including several measures of negative affect and a cravingmeasure. The TSST produced significant changes only in the secondsession. The stress imagery protocol showed better replicability acrosstwo sessions. Cocaine users and methamphetamine users did not respondsimilarly in their craving responses. Reported craving formethamphetamine after stress testing showed decreases or much smallerincreases compared to that for cocaine. Neither stress testsignificantly increased salivary cortisol or DHEA, and changes inhormone concentrations were not related to subjective responses. Theseresults suggest that stress imagery testing procedures may be useful asprovocative tests of stress-induced affect and stimulant drug craving.Although less convincing because of the heterogeneity of the subjects,they also suggest that HPA axis responsivity is not clearly linked toacute stress-induced stimulant craving or affective response.

A recent multilaboratory experiment foundsignificant laboratory effects and genotype x laboratory interactionseven after rigorous standardization, raising the concern that resultsare idiosyncratic to a particular laboratory. This finding may beregarded by some critics as a serious shortcoming in behavior genetics.A different strategy is offered here: (i) recognize that even afterinvesting much effort in identifying and eliminating causes forlaboratory differences, genotype x laboratory interaction is anunavoidable fact of life. (h) Incorporate this understanding into thestatistical analysis of multilaboratory experiments using the mixedmodel. Such a statistical approach sets a higher benchmark for findingsignificant genotype differences.

The questionnaire is a self-report 110-item measure thatpostulates five affective temperaments-the depressive, cyclothymic,irritable, hyperthymic, and anxious-which embody both strengths andliabilities along affective lines. Methods: The questionnaire wasadministered to 658 clinically-well subjects in a Turkish universitycircle. We undertook item analysis and test-retest reliability. We thenexamined internal consistency through factor analysis with PCA rotation.Results: We found good to excellent test-retest reliability (0.73-0.91),and internal consistency (0.77-0.85). We deleted 10 items with factorloading < 0.20 for their own subscales, resulting in a questionnairewith 99 items. Despite considerable overlap between depressive andcognitive anxiety traits, a distinct ""nervous""-anxious factor emerged aswell, and the hypothesized (original English) 5-factor structure of theTEMPS-A was supported. Cut-offs for each temperament were based onz-scores higher than +2S.D. Dominant irritable (3.7%). nervous-anxious(3.7%) and depressive (3.1%) temperaments were the most common in thispopulation, whereas dominant cyclothymic (1.7%) and hyperthymic (1.2%)temperaments were relatively uncommon. These temperaments tended to losetheir intensity with age. As expected, women scored significantly higheron the nervous-anxious, and men on the hyperthymic temperaments.Limitations: The sample was composed of younger subjects with highereducation than the General population of Turkey. Although thedistribution of the scores for each of the temperaments deviatedsomewhat from normal Curves, for heuristic reasons we did attempt toprovide prevalence rates based on z-scores. Conclusion: In thispreliminary version of the TEMPS-A, we have retained 100 (of theoriginal 110) traits loading > 0.20. Some deleted items referred tosleep, others appeared socially desirability traits in the Turkishculture endorsed by many subjects.

Captiveenvironments may interfere with these behavioral responses, and theresulting stress may alter many physiological parameters. Abnormalbehaviors indicate that an animal is unable to adjust behaviorally tothe captive environment and, hence, may be expressing abnormalphysiology. Therefore, captive environments may affect the followingaspects of an experiment: validity, by introducing abnormal animals intoexperiments; reliability, by increasing interindividual variationthrough the introduction of such individuals; and replicability, byaltering the number and type of such individuals between laboratories.Thus, far from increasing variability, enrichment may actually improvevalidity, reliability, and replicability by reducing the number ofabnormal animals introduced into experiments. In this article, thespecific example of abnormal repetitive behaviors (ARBs) is explored.ARBs in captive animals appear to involve the same mechanisms as ARBs inhuman psychiatry, which reflect underlying abnormalities of brainfunction. ARBs are also correlated with a wide range of behavioralchanges that affect experimental outcomes. Thus, ARBs in laboratoryanimals may compromise validity, reliability, and replicability,especially in behavioral experiments; and enrichments that prevent ARBmay enhance validity, reliability, and replicability. Although manylinks in this argument have been tested experimentally, key issues stillremain in the interpretation of these data. In particular, it iscurrently unclear (1) whether or not the differences in brain functionseen in animals performing ARB are abnormal, (2) which common behavioralparadigms are affected by ARB, and (3) whether enrichment does indeedimprove the quality of behavioral data. Ongoing and future workaddressing these issues is outlined."," 85"," 66"," 0"," 0"," 86"," 1084-2020"," WOS:000227259000004",NA,NA," 15775020"," Garner, Joseph/C-8422-2009",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, geochemical processes andporewater solute distributions in sandy beds are not well studied withvery few exceptions. An experiment was carried out to determinedifferences in nutrient fluxes between coarse and fine-grained sedimentand water column in aquatic laboratory microcosms.Four 80-litre aquaria, containing seawater and ten sediment cores (8-cmdiameter) each were monitored for 60 days. Coarse and fine-grainedsediment, collected from two different coastal areas of Mytilini, islandof Lesvos, were sieved to avoid macrofaunal bioturbation andhomogenized. Two aquaria were used as replications for each treatment inorder to validate the replicability of the experiment. Informationrelated to chemical and biological parameters was collected from thewater column, the interstitial water and the sediment (in 12-daysinterval). Net fluxes of oxygen and inorganic nutrients were measured byclosing the sediment cores with a rubber stopper. The optimum incubationtime was estimated to be 10 hours in a previous experiment. Watersamples were collected just before closing the cores and after theincubation, in triplicates.The replicability of results within the microcosms of the same treatmentwas excellent in general and differences in trends of fluxes werepresented for specific nutrients. Experimental data showed remarkablereplicability in terms of temporal variability in both treatments. Inmost cases data had the same behaviour with only minor differences inthe magnitude of values i.e. ammonium, silicate and nitrite. However,the nutrient fluxes between sediment and water column depictedsignificant individual fluctuations.The nutrient concentration changes in ""blank"" cores were low in bothtreatments with few exceptions. The methodology developed in the presentwork including the experimental set up and the experimental design isproposed to be used for the clarification of the effects of differentenvironmental factors on nutrient fluxes between sediment and watercolumn in coastal marine ecosystems."," 0"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 1106-5516"," WOS:000237755500161",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA," 9th International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology"," SEP 01-03, 2005"," Rhodes Isl, GREECE"," Global Network Environm Sci & Technol; Univ Aegean, Dept EnvironmStudies",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA," 960-7475-33-X",NA,NA,NA," Lekkas, TD"," Proceedings of the International Conference on Environmental Science andTechnology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Urban DevelopmentProgrammes are usually developed in a complex interplay betweendifferent governmental levels, and implemented by a wide variety ofpublic and non-public parties. This paper addresses the organisation ofthese programmes, concentrating in particular on the form and extent of`public-public partnership', i.e. on the role that the different levelsof the public administration play, both through the administrativesystem and through policy-making. The `empirical' basis for the paperconsists of case studies, derived from the UGIS project (`UrbanGovernance, Social Inclusion and Sustainability,' a research projectfinanced by the European Commission, DG RTD). The short analysis makesclear that both the model of public administration, in terms of theextent and form of decentralisation, and the presence (or lack) of anational policy framework determine the extent to which UDPs can beplanned, approved and implemented at the local level. One of the mainfindings is that the central influence over UDPs depends more on theurban policy framework of the central government than on the model ofpublic administration of a country. Countries with strong national(regional) urban policies, sufficient decentralisation of publicadministration to the municipal level and the use of governance methodsat the local level open up possibilities for successful UDPs. Withoutupper-level urban policy frameworks UDPs might be successful as well,but their replicability and the control over their external effects willnot be ensured."," 4"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 4"," 0040-747X"," WOS:000230727400005",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There is evidencefrom family, twin and adoption studies that the contribution of geneticfactors accounts for 40-60% of alcohol dependence. In humans, the mainapproaches for investigating the complex genetics of alcoholism arelinkage and association studies. Linkage studies reported alcoholism tobe linked to only 5 chromosomal regions (on chromosomes 1, 7, andpossibly 2, 4 and 5) and none of those loci reached a high statisticalsignificance. Association studies are conducted by numerous researchgroups. They test a potential relationship between a certain geneticvariant and alcoholism in a design similar to the classical case-controlstudies. Polymorphisms in the GABAergic, serotonergic, dopaminergic, andglutamatergic system have been related to alcohol- or alcoholism-associated phenotypes. Many studies failed to confirm initialpositive results, raising doubts on the validity and replicability ofthis study approach. Recently more research has been conducted usinggenetic microarrays to investigate expression patterns of genes underthe influence of chronic alcohol consumption. However, these approacheshave several shortcomings, in particular their applicability in humans.In short, approaches in use for years by many research groups such aslinkage and association studies showed either controversial ordisappointing results.

Methods: Two clinical and threenonclinical samples were included in the cross-sectional part of thestudy. One clinical and one nonclinical sample also participated in the6-month follow-up study. To test the replicability of the three-factorstructure of the TAS-20 across samples, a principal component analysiswas conducted, followed by a Procrustes rotation. Linear regressionanalyses were conducted to examine temporal stability and to determinethe specificity of the associations among the TAS-20 scales,neuroticism, and extraversion. Results: The three-factor structure ofthe TAS-20 was confirmed across all five samples. With a few exceptions,neuroticism and extraversion attained a higher level of temporalstability than the alexithymia scales. The TAS-subscale measuringdifficulty identifying feelings (DIF) was less stable in the clinicalthan in the nonclinical sample. Neuroticism was most strongly associatedwith DIF, whereas extraversion was mainly related to externally orientedthinking (EOT). A combination of both neuroticism and extraversion wasthe best predictor of difficulty describing feelings (DDF).

Soil lipids, mostlyoriginating from plants and microorganisms, have traditionally beenanalysed by non-automated extraction and separation methods, whichproduce several lipid fractions, operationally defined by polarity. Herewe present a combination of fast, automated and reproducible techniques,adopted from organic geochemical studies, for preparative separation ofindividual soil lipid fractions with increasing polarity. Thesetechniques involve commercially available instruments, includingaccelerated solvent extraction and a two-step automated medium-pressureliquid chromatography procedure. The method yields eight lipid fractionsconsisting of five fractions fully amenable to gas chromatography/massspectrometry (GC/MS) (aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons,ketones, alcohols, carboxylic acids), and three fractions of highlypolar or high molecular weight compounds (bases, very long-chain waxesters (C40(+)), high polarity compounds) that were not measurable withGC/MS under standard conditions. We tested the method on fiveagricultural soils. Results show that (i) mass recoveries for theindividual fractions are reproducible, (ii) within individual fractionscompound distribution patterns are reproducible, as demonstrated foralkanes and carboxylic acids, and (iii) individual fractions representdistinct and clean compound classes, free of interfering substancesdetectable by GC/MS. Thus, automated separation can be a fast, effectiveand reproducible procedure for fractionation of complex mixtures of soillipids into clean compound classes, directly suitable for a variety ofmolecular (e.g. GC/MS) and isotopic characterizations (e.g. gaschromatography coupled with isotope ratio monitoring mass spectrometryor accelerator mass spectrometry)."," 32"," 19"," 2"," 0"," 34"," 1351-0754"," WOS:000222007600012",NA,NA,NA," Wiesenberg, Guido/A-3883-2009; Schmidt, Michael/G-5186-2012",NA,NA,NA,NA," Wiesenberg, Guido/0000-0003-2738-5775; Schmidt,Michael/0000-0002-7227-0646",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The need for increasingly precisereconstructions of relative sea-level change has, in-turn, driven thedevelopment of new methodologies capable of resolving fine-scalevariability within salt-marsh sedimentary sequences. The use ofsalt-marsh foraminifera, as precise indicators of past tide levels hasplayed a central role in this process and is exemplified by a number ofdetailed studies conducted in Connecticut, USA. In this paper, we applythe most recent methodological advance in the reconstruction of relativesea-levels using salt-marsh foraminifera. We develop a foraminiferaltransfer function for tide level, derived from the modem foraminiferaldistributions of four Connecticut salt-marshes.In contrast to existing approaches that employ site-specificinterpolations of local vertical foraminiferal assemblage zones, thistransfer function can provide objective, quantitative and reproducibleestimates of palacomarsh-surface elevation with explicitly stated errorterms for marshes throughout Connecticut, irrespective of differences intidal range.We demonstrate the foraminiferal transfer function approach by employingit to reconstruct changes in palaeomarsh-surface elevation from threecores recovered from Hammock River marsh, Connecticut. The resultingreconstructions, which are precise to +/- 0.09 m, are tested using anindependent dataset from the neighbouring state of Maine, and are usedto assess a pivotal record of mean high water (MHW) change from thissite. We conclude that the transfer function reconstructions show goodgeneral agreement with previous records of palaeomarsh-surfaceelevation, but with the advantages of quantified error terms and atransparent, reproducible methodology. This replicability will assist inthe comparison or combination of local records of MHW change to inferlarge-scale, regional sea-level variations. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Reference is made to a bicultural New Zealand mental healthnursing clinical indicator study that employed a three-round reactiveDelphi survey. Equal proportions of Maori and non-Maori nurses (n = 20)and consumers (n = 10) rated the importance of 91 clinical indicatorstatements for the achievement of professional practice standards.Additional statements (n = 21) suggested by Delphi participants in round1 were included in subsequent rounds. In round 2, participants explainedthe rating they applied to statements that had not reached consensus inround 1, and summarized responses were provided to participants in round3. Consensus was considered to have been achieved if 85% of round 3ratings lay within a 2-point bracket on the 5-point Likert-scaleoverall, or in one of the Maori nurse, non-Maori nurse, or consumergroups.

In theanalytic situation, dialogue is available to test the world-view andenlarge its horizon, in accord with Gadamer's expansion of hermeneutics,'the classical discipline concerned with the art of understandingtexts', into a method of inquiry open to the possibilities of otherness.An example is given from an analytic training seminar, in which theauthor began by projecting his version of the theory of psychologicaltypes onto the dream material a candidate offered in response to theseminar. A dialogue with the candidate ensued which enabled the teacherto correct his original, somewhat rigid, application of his scientificviewpoint. In such a dialogue, psyche emerges as the final interpreterof what is, generating hypotheses that can fruitfully be applied to theunderstanding of other cases."," 3"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 3"," 0021-8774"," WOS:000220306900004",NA,NA," 15032928",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA," Conference on Science and the Symbolic World - New Paradigms inPsychoanalysis and Analytical Psychology"," APR 23-27, 2003"," Charleston, SC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The stability andreplicability of MEG-derived recordings during this paradigm were testedin a group of eight neurologically normal volunteers and six patientswith perirolandic lesions. We found that a common sensorimotor corticalnetwork, engaging sensory (SI, S2) and motor (M1) areas, was reliablyactivated in all subjects and patients and that the results remainedexceptionally stable over time. Additionally, the clinical validity ofthe MEG-derived maps of activation was tested through intraoperativeelectrocortical stimulation mapping in the group of patients.

The results of this validation studyshow that the so-called CSSMP is a reliable and reproducible method forassessing simultaneously sensory and motor areas.

We say that a test haslow replicability if its outcome strongly depends on the particularrandom partitioning of the data that is used to perform it. We presentempirical measures of replicability and use them to compare theperformance of several popular tests in a realistic setting involvingstandard learning algorithms and benchmark datasets. Based on ourresults we give recommendations on which test to use."," 33"," 9"," 0"," 0"," 33"," 0302-9743"," WOS:000221955100001",NA,NA,NA," Frank, Eibe/A-1434-2008",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA," 8th Pacific/Asia Conference on Advances in Knowledge Discovery and DataMining"," MAY 26-28, 2004"," Sydney, AUSTRALIA"," NICIA; SAS; Univ Technol Sydney; Deakin Univ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA," 3-540-22064-X",NA,NA,NA," Dai, HSrikant, RZhang, C"," LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Only recently, the threeprototypes were replicated in self-reports on questionnaires intended toassess the Big Five (see e.g. Asendorpf, Borkenau, Ostendorf, & vanAken, 2001). This paper addresses the question of whether the threeprototypes are replicable across different data sources. Clusterstructures in self-, peer, and behaviour ratings, all based on the BigFive, were examined in a sample of 600 monozygotic and dizygotic twinsranging in age from 18 to 70 years. The three prototypes could beclearly identified in the self-reports only, whereas in ratings byothers only the Resilient prototype could be replicated. In both peerand behaviour ratings, the second and the third cluster reflected aNon-desirable and an Average type. The analysis of cross-dataconsistency revealed only moderate agreement in assignments ofindividual subjects to types.

Six resulting clusters were labeled Disengaged, Immotive,Relapse Risk, Early Action, Maintainers, and Habituated. A series ofanalyses tested the internal and external validity of the typology. Theinternal validity test revealed that four of the clusters demonstratedhigh stability and replicability, while the Relapse Risk and EarlyAction clusters were less stable. Differences among clusters onself-reported exercise behavior and a strong association with stage ofchange for regular exercise provided external validity evidence of thetypology.Conclusions. The resulting typology reflects a range of motivationalpatterns that are likely to be responsive to different types of messagesand strategies regarding adoption and maintenance of regular exercise.The typology also generates a number of hypotheses about the identifiedclusters that can be empirically tested in further studies.

A sample of 19 child and adolescent patients with GAD and 19controls completed the modified Stroop paradigm with threat,depression-related, positive and neutral words.Results. The data revealed a selective Stroop interference effect fornegative emotional information in the GAD patients, relative to theperformance of the controls.Conclusions. The results provide evidence of a modified Stroop effectfor negative emotional material in children and adolescents with GAD,suggesting that modified Stroop processing in younger generally anxiouspopulations broadly mirrors the profile of results in adults."," 46"," 18"," 1"," 1"," 48"," 0144-6657"," WOS:000185847300001",NA,NA," 14565889"," dalgleish, tim/E-8341-2010; Moradi, Ali R/E-4027-2013",NA,NA," 3",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The studyalso assessed the reliability of the scale and the influence of gender,age, and education on TAS-20 scores. Method: The TAS-20 was administeredto 1933 adults (880 men and 1053 women) residing in several small citiesand towns in Ontario, Canada.

Fourteen healthy adult volunteers (7 males and 7 females), withan average age of 26.61 +/- 4.20 years and no history of extractions,temporomandibular joint dysfunction, or orthodontic treatment, wereselected for the study. Accurate casts were mounted on an articulator(Denar D4A) by means of a facebow and maximum intercuspation siliconeregistration record. A mechanical 3-dimensional mandibular positionindicator was constructed and mounted on the articulator enabling theoperator to analyze the mandibular positions in 3 spatial axes (x,anteroposterior; y, superoinferior; z, mediolateral shift). Each centricrelation method was recorded four times on each subject (at baseline, 1hour, 1 day, and 1 week at approximately the same time of day). Recordswere transferred to the articulator, and data were extracted using astereomicroscope modified to accept the mandibular position indicator.RESULTS: Variability within subjects ranged from 0.03 mm (left-side zaxis for the bimanual method) to 1.6 mm (left-side y axis for the Gothicarch method). To indicate the least variable (most repeatable) method acomparison was made using the F test.

Reversing the cause-effect relationshipof this line of research we investigated whether preceding regionalsuicide rates are related to subsequent election results. Methods: ForAustria's 121 districts, we regressed averaged standardized suiciderates for the preceding period (1988-1994) on political parties'subsequent electoral gains/losses (1999-to-1995) while controlling for aset of 12 domain-relevant psychosocial/economic indices. Results:Stepwise weighted multiple regression led to a significant model. The1999-to-1995 electoral gains/losses of two opposition parties, togetherwith the population variation caused by migration balance and bybirths/deaths balance, accounted for a substantial part (30%) of thevariability in preceding district-level suicide rates. Various othersocial indices failed to contribute further substantial increments tothis model. Conclusions: This finding suggests that variations inpreceding regional suicide incidence might be mirrored in subsequentchanges in voting behavior. A speculative post hoc explanation for thefinding is offered: on a community level, suicide's aftermath mightproduce socially and politically alienated survivors of suicide whoco-shape swings towards opposition parties in subsequent generalelections. The finding calls for more research on suicide's long-termaftermath. Limitations: Within-country replicability and cross-nationalgeneralizability await further investigation. At present, thefactor/mechanism accounting for this finding is neither well-establishednor has been directly tested. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Old lessons are reviewed based on the notion ofreplicability of the ""Kerala model"" and new lessons are analyzed withinthe contexts of sustainability and economic globalization."," 7"," 1"," 0"," 0"," 7"," 0047-2336"," WOS:000186036600003",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Currentmethods for estimating viral production (VP) rely on one or more poorlyconstrained conversion factors. Here, three incubation-based VP methods;fluorescently labeled viruses (FLV), dilution (DIL) and thymidineincorporation (TdR), were evaluated in water samples from the Delaware(DB) and Chesapeake (CB) Bays. In the FLV method the changing ratio ofan added fluorescently labeled viral tracer to total viruses is used toestimate production of new viruses. The dilution approach utilizesvirus-free water to dilute viral abundance to ca. 10% of originalconcentration in experimental incubations. Viral production is inferredfrom the slope of the regression line for changes in viral abundanceover time. The TdR method measures VP through incorporation of3H-thymidine into the viral fraction. VP rates were variable accordingto each method. For station 858 CB, average VP rates were higher for FLVand TdR (16.9X1010 vir/L/d), (17.2X1010 vir/L/d) respectively, than forDIL (4.50X109 vir/L/d). Mean estimates of virioplankton turnover variedbetween methods and locations: CB (FLV 1.85d, DIL 0.68d, TdR 1.64d); DB(FLV 1.65d, DIL 0.19d). Using a burst size of 50 to estimateviral-mediated bacterial mortality indicates that FLV overestimates VPin eutrophic water samples as greater than 100% of bacterial productionwould be consumed through viral lysis. DIL and TdR VP estimates yieldedmore realistic estimates of viral-mediated mortiality with respect tobacterial production. The FLV method had the advantage of providing bothVP and virus removal data. However, FLV requires preparation of alabeled viral concentrate and more microscopic enumerations than DIL.Among the methods DIL was the least difficult and most efficient methodhowever, 80% of bacteria were removed during vacuum filtration resultingin poor replicability. The TdR approach gave similar VP estimates toDIL, but requires use of a large and poorly constrained conversionfactor."," 0"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 1060-2011 ISSN "," BCI:BCI200300534188",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA," 103rd American Society for Microbiology General Meeting"," May 18-22, 2003"," Washington, DC, USA"," American Society for Microbiology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA," Washington, DC, USA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Order was allocated randomly with repeatadministration interrupted by distraction questions. Results: There were185 students who participated, providing 178 fully completed responses.Twenty subjects were male. There was overall agreement in the scores of157 subjects (88.2%), providing a kappa coefficient of 0.811, withagreement in prediction of eating disorder for 167 (93.8%) and a kappavalue of 0.824 (both p < 0.001).

In addition, overlap ofclassification systems was examined to determine whether the fourtypologies may be narrowed to a smaller set of meaningful, non-redundantsubtype schemas.Design Baseline data from five treatment outcome studies were used tofacilitate subtyping according to four alcohol typologies: antisocial(ASP) versus non-ASP, early versus late onset, Type 1/Type 2 and TypeA/Type B.Setting The studies were conducted at several in-patient and out-patienttreatment sites.Participants The sample included 342 participants (23% female) who metDSM-III-R criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence. MeasurementsSubjects were assessed on substance use severity, family history,psychopathology, personality and psychosocial functioning.Findings Type 1/Type 2 and Type A/B typologies were replicated. Type1/Type 2 had poor construct validity due to symptom cluster overlapbetween the two subgroups. Only 14% of the subjects met criteria for ASPThe two strongest associations including that between early versus lateonset and Type 1/Type 2 and that between ASP versus non-ASP and TypeA/Type 13, were expected and reflect overlaps in conceptual definitions.In comparison, the relationship between early versus late onset and ASPversus non-ASP and Type A/B was weak.Conclusions Clinical utility of the ASP/non-ASP typology is limited innon-Veterans Administration (VA) samples, due to low prevalence. TheType 1/Type 2 subtyping schema was redundant with the age of onsetschema, and was the least internally valid of all four typologies.

Appealingfor its ambitious aspiration to harmonize sustainable economicdevelopment at the local level with the conservation of legallyestablished protected areas (e.g., parks and reserves), the ICDPapproach recently has drawn criticism from conservation biologists forfailing to ensure adequate protection of biodiversity. Developmentplanners and economists have also raised questions about the financialsustainability of ICDPs in practice and the replicability of the modelfrom highly local contexts to larger regional scales, This paper brieflyreviews the central elements of the concept of integrated conservationand development and the emerging debate over its effectiveness, Adescription of the Community Initiative Program (CIP), a pilot programof the Rondonia Natural Resources Management project (PLANAFLORO) in thewestern Brazilian Amazon state of Rondonia, follows. The CIP is asignificant experiment because it boldly attempted to apply theprinciples of ICDP to the regional scale involving numerous differentcommunities in one program simultaneously. Based on the author'smid-term review of the CIP in 1999, the development and conservationimpacts of the program are considered. While the CIP has notsignificantly curbed the degradation of protected areas in Rondonia asintended, the evidence suggests lower rates of deforestation inmunicipios (i.e. counties) with the highest concentrations of CIPprojects, Although the economic development impacts are mixed,approximately 50% of the projects delivered tangible benefits to localcommunities. Lessons learned from the CIP are presented in the finalsection. Among the lessons learned from the CIP, detailed in the finalsection, are several that will be familiar to other ICDP evaluators: theimportance of thematic coherence in initial project design, the need forexplicit attention on environmental conservation objectives, deficientinstitutional capacity of implementing organizations, inadequateattention to women's concerns and roles in community projects, and lackof technical criteria for measuring project sustainability."," 16"," 7"," 0"," 0"," 16"," 0364-152X"," WOS:000175552200003",NA,NA," 11992169",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Types are conceptuallyconvenient because they summarize many traits in a single label, butuntil recently most researchers agreed that there was little evidencefor the existence of discrete personality types. Several groups ofresearchers have now proposed replicable, empirical person clustersbased on measures of the Five-Factor Model. We consider severalmethodological artifacts that might be responsible for these types, andconclude that these artifacts may contribute to the replicability oftypes, but cannot entirely account for it. The present research attemptsto replicate these types in four large and diverse adult samples: theBaltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (N = 1856); the East BaltimoreEpidemiologic Catchment Area study (N = 486); the University of NorthCarolina Alumni Heart Study (N = 2 420); and an HIV risk reductionintervention study (N = 274). A clear replication (kappa = 0.60) of theproposed types vas found in only one sample by one standard ofcomparison. The failure of the three personality types to replicate inthree of the four samples leads to the conclusion that they are notrobust empirical entities. Type membership predicted psychosocialfunctioning and ego resiliency and control, but only because itsummarized trait standing; dimensional trait measures were consistentlybetter predictors. Nevertheless, while the types do not refer todistinct, homogeneous classes of persons, they do have utility asconvenient labels summarizing combinations of traits that relate toimportant outcomes.

Thepresent study aimed to investigate the consistency and replicability ofthese prototypes across different FFM measures (i.e. HiPIC and NEO PI-R)and ages (children and adolescents). In addition, the stability ofprototype classification across a 3 year interval was examined. Thetypes described by Caspi and Asendorpf and colleagues were onlypartially replicable and consistent across ages starting from HiPICratings, but not for NEO-PI-R ratings.

CVs on variablesinvolving animals were higher than CVs on plant end-points, which inturn were higher than abiotic variables for all experiments. However, toenhance the interpretability and implementation of micro/mesocosmstudies for pesticide registration, a number of context-dependent stepscould be incorporated; 1) determine the appropriate experimental designand number of replicates by using power analysis, 2) Utilise advancedstatistical analysis, such as probabilistic effect distribution andprincipal response curves, 4) report, preferably in quantitative termsusing power analysis, the risk of Type II error. The author's primaryconclusion is that the level of CVs is context dependent and, therefore,it is not possible to suggest a generally acceptable level of CVs forall experiments. This has been suggested both directly and indirectly inthe literature. Moreover, the number of insignificant (p > 0.05) resultsis high, 88% of all test biotic variables had no statisticalsignificance. The average number of replicates were 3-4, whichtheoretically should yield significant effects at least at the highesttest-concentration, then resulting in 75-66% insignificant results."," 19"," 18"," 1"," 0"," 20"," 0944-1344"," WOS:000179435400013",NA,NA," 12515353",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We explain that Negative Valence terms may distort thestructure of personality-descriptive terms, and that the substantivevariance of Honesty is weakly correlated with Negative Valence. Also, wepoint out that our proposed six factors are (like the Big Five) roughlyorthogonal, and that the occurrence of rotational variants within thissix-dimensional space is not problematic. We argue that in terms ofcomprehensiveness, parsimony, independence of factors, and replicabilityacross languages, our proposed six-factor model so far seems to be theoptimal structure of personality characteristics.

The emergence ofnew forms of credit guarantees, the availability of instruments tofinance private and municipal projects without sovereign guarantees, andthe proliferation of new modalities for private-public sectorpartnerships opened up opportunities for resource mobilization and risksharing which were not available to most developing countries a decadeago.While these innovative financing mechanisms have accessed new,previously inaccessible sources of funds for sector investments and, incombination with a more realistic pricing of services, have enhanced thefinancial sustainability of sectors such as power, water, sanitation,and transport, they have not necessarily enhanced environmentalsustainability. Furthermore, despite the obvious similarities in theinnovative financing instruments in these four sectors, there are alsosignificant differences arising from both different sectoral featuresand historical reasons.This paper explores innovative instruments for sector financing,focusing particularly on energy, transport, water, sanitation, andforestry.

Any solar-induced climatic change needs tobe distinguished from other causes of natural climate variability andfrom short-term catastrophic events induced either by external orinternal processes. Such events might themselves generate a periodicity,or in combination with other forcing factors they may contribute towardsa periodicity (and so spuriously imply a universal and continuingperiodicity in the climate record), or they may resonate with asolar-induced periodicity. Here, evidence from peat records forperiodicity in climate change over the mid to late Holocene is reviewedand this is followed by a test of the replicability of claimedperiodicities using blanket peat data covering the past 2000 yr fromfour sites in the British Isles. Results suggest that the mires studieddo go through phases of being responsive to periodic forcing factors,with ca. 200, ca. 80 and 60-50 yr wavelengths reflected in some datasets. However, the patterns shown are not consistent. This could be theresult of local conditions at individual mires (human impact,sensitivity and vegetation succession) or of changes in the strength ornature of global forcing factors. Assessing a solar-mire link remainsdifficult because the century-scale variations of the Sun show differentintervals between solar minima, the durations of which are themselvesunequal, and because the proxy-climate data-sets from peat profiles maythemselves not be dated with sufficient precision and/or accuracy.Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."," 31"," 7"," 1"," 0"," 32"," 0267-8179"," WOS:000169009600005",NA,NA,NA," Chambers, Frank/I-2965-2012",NA,NA,NA,NA," Chambers, Frank/0000-0002-0998-2093",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To determine the usefulness of the bilirubin-albumin (B:A)molar ratio (MR) and unbound bilirubin (UB) as compared with serum totalbilirubin (TB) in predicting bilirubin encephalopathy as assessed byauditory brainstem responses (ABR) in infants of 28 to 32 weeks'gestational age.Study Design. During a 2-year period, serial ABRs were obtained on 143infants of 28 to 32 weeks' gestational age during the first postnatalweek. Waveforms were categorized on the basis of response replicabilityand the presence of waves III and V. Wave V latencies were also seriallyanalyzed when measurable for individual infants. Maturation of the ABRwas defined as abnormal when the waveform category worsened and/orlatency increased during the study interval. Serum albumin was analyzedat 48 to 72 hours of age in all patients. Serum TB was analyzed asclinically indicated. Aliquots of the same samples were also analyzedfor UB in a subset of infants.Results. The mean peak TB concentration (10.1 +/- 1.7 mg/dL) for the 71infants with normal ABR maturation was not significantly different fromthe mean peak TB (10.2 +/- 2.1 mg/dL) in the 24-hour period precedingthe ABR's first showing abnormal maturation in the other 55 infants.However, in infants with UB analyzed, the mean peak UB (0.62 +/- 0.20 vs0.40 +/- 0.15 mg/dL) was significantly higher in the infants withabnormal maturation (n = 25) than in infants with normal maturation (n =20). The B:A MR results were equivocal. In the entire study population,there was no difference in B:A MR between infants with normal versusabnormal ABR maturation. However, in the subset of infants in whom UBwas measured, although TB was not different, there was a significantdifference in B:A MR. Based on receiver-operating characteristic curves,a UB level of 0.5 mg/dL was the best discriminator with a sensitivity of70% and a specificity of 75%. The proportion of infants who had UB >0.5mug/dL and UB less than or equal to0.5 mg/dL and who had abnormal ABR,maturation was 0.81 and 0.33, respectively, with a significantdifference in the incidence of transient bilirubin encephalopathy amongthese 2 groups. The relative risk of abnormal ABR maturation with UB>0.5 mug/dL compared with UB less than or equal to0.05 mg/dL was 2.45(95% confidence interval: 1.33-4.49).Conclusions. UB is a more sensitive predictor than either serumbilirubin or B:A MR of abnormal ABR maturation, and hence transientbilirubin encephalopathy in premature newborns with hyperbilirubinemia."," 76"," 51"," 5"," 1"," 82"," 0031-4005"," WOS:000168116200031",NA,NA," 11335741",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this paper, variability ofphysico-chemical and biological parameters measured during two long-termexperiments (8 to 9 months) in uncontaminated outdoor freshwater lenticmesocosms (8 m(3)) is analysed. Consequences on the design ofecotoxicity tests in mesocosms and on data analysis are also addressed.Water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen concentration and concentrationof suspended solids exhibited a very low variability whereas nutrientconcentrations displayed elevated levels of variability. Amongbiological parameters, those measured at the individual level were lessvariable than those measured at the community level. Functionaldescriptors frequently exhibited a lower inter-mesocosm variability thanstructural descriptors. Aggregation of data proved to significantlyreduce inter-mesocosm variability. The results indicate that univariatestatistical methods may be used for physico-chemical or species-level(e.g. biometric parameters) data which exhibit a moderate inter-mesocosmvariability. The use of multivariate techniques is suggested for otherlevels of investigation. Nevertheless, variability is not sufficient toidentify useful parameters.

A total offive duplication and deletion events were detected. These five eventsoccurred in three of the six lines, whereas the remaining three linescontained no detectable events. Three of the duplications were at 2.85Mb of the E. coli chromosome, providing evidence for the replicabilityof the adaptation to high temperature. Four candidate genes previouslyshown to play roles in stress and starvation survival were identified inthe region of common duplication. Expression of the two candidate genesexamined is elevated over expression levels in the ancestral lines orthe lines without the duplication. In the two cases where theduplication at 2.85 Mb has been further characterized, the timing of thegenome reorganization is coincident with significant increases inrelative fitness.

The project focuses on timber harvesting as anactivity to potentially supplement community livelihoods and has shownthat commercial harvesting of the natural forest by local communities ispossible and can be mutually beneficial to all concerned. The strengthsand weaknesses of community-based harvesting of the natural forest areassessed. Its strengths lie in the simplicity of the system and itscapability to be satisfactorily implemented by the target group. Assuch, the system itself would appear to be sufficiently robust to beadaptable to most situations, regardless of country, culture ortradition. Its weakness lies in the vulnerability of the system to thoseexternal factors that set the framework conditions in which the systemis to be applied. The usefulness and replicability, both inside andoutside of Indonesia, of the approach as a system that can provideopportunities to improve community livelihood and welfare largelydepends on the support of the respective governments for community-basedforest management, and their readiness to create compatible frameworksfor their implementation. New investigation is required into how policyand institutional change can be made to improve governance at alllevels, in order to motivate and support community based initiatives."," 1"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 1"," 1465-5489"," CABI:20013169214",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA," Paper presented at the 16th Commonwealth Forestry Conference, 'Forestsin a changing landscape', Freemantle, Australia, 18-25 April 2001.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This wascontrary to the popular belief that existed both within and outsidePakistan. The popular notions, which were related to constraints of anintegrated socio-technical system, illiterate farmers, social pressurefrom big landowners, and obstacles caused by the hierarchical society,were proven to be invalid under conditions of a participatory process ofsocial organization. The methodologies used had the common focus onbuilding self-reliance among the farmers, and using field training andother forms of capacity building as the major motivating influences. Afield implementation coordination committee consisting ofrepresentatives of all service delivery agencies working in the area,along with selected water users, highlighted the needed farmer-agencycoordination, and greatly facilitated an incentive mechanism throughcollaborative activities within the pilot sites. This combined effortsuccessfully achieved the formation of a number water users' associationat the tertiary (watercourse) level and a few water users' federations(WUFs) at the secondary canal (distributary) level at the selected pilotsites. The emerging results of this social experiment are encouraging.The new WUFs were able to take collective decisions to negotiate withstate irrigation authorities regarding joint management agreements(JMAs) for managing water resources in the canal system. Although theJMAs were not made immediately effective due to a procedural difficultyimposed by the present legal framework, the WUFs proceeded to test theircapacity in undertaking a planned maintenance programme during the canalclosure period, and also initiating a maintenance-related infrastructureimprovement programme. Replicability of this social organizationprogramme lies in the methodology adopted: the deployment of small fieldteams and the use of local volunteers. The step-wise social organizationprocess is meant to enhance sustainable interest of all the actorsinvolved. One drawback in the pilot efforts, however, has been the lackof full commitment from related government agencies, which have to takethe initiative for empowering the water users' organizations. However,both the enthusiasm and the capacity demonstrated by the water users insocial organization for collective action are considerable, and show agood potential for further progress. Very likely, the demand generatedat the local level could facilitate a process of bureaucraticreorientation, which in turn would provide the necessary institutionalsupport for the new water users' organizations."," 0"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 0"," 0049-8602"," CABI:20013140181",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Significantimprovements were seen in terminal TM/HBPC patients in HR-QoL scales ofemotional role function, social function, bodily pain, mental health,vitality, and general health. Team-Managed HBPC nonterminal patients hadsignificant increases of 5 to 10 points in 5 of 6 satisfaction with carescales. The caregivers of terminal patients in the TM/HBPC groupimproved significantly in HR-QoL measures except for vitality andgeneral health. Caregivers of nonterminal patients improvedsignificantly in QoL measures and reported reduced caregiver burden(P=.008). Team-Managed HBPC patients with severe disability experienceda 22% relative decrease (0.7 readmissions/patient for TM/HBPC group vs0.9 readmissions/patient for control group) in hospital readmissions(P=.03) at 6 months that was not sustained at 12 months. Total mean perperson costs were 6.8% higher in the TM/HBPC group at 6 months ($19 190vs $17 971) and 12.1% higher at 12 months ($31 401 vs $28 008).Conclusions The TM/HBPC intervention improved most HR-QoL measures amongterminally ill patients and satisfaction among non-terminally illpatients. It improved caregiver HR-QoL, satisfaction with care, andcaregiver burden and reduced hospital readmissions at 6 months, but itdid not substitute for other forms of care.

The current report builds on the substantialtheoretical knowledge and empirical data obtained from these structuralanalyses with a view to obtain further progress in the evolution of ourunderstanding of animal anxiety in the elevated plus-maze. The purposeof the present report was two-fold: (a) to test if the a pioriimposition of a 3-factor model, or a competing 2-factor elevatedplus-maze model, would fit our sample (n = 200 CD-1 mice) data in eachof two trials within an inferential confirmatory factor analyticframework; (b) provide a well-fitting model that confers indicatorvariables that can most effectively and parsimoniously measureunderlying constructs of elevated plus-maze behaviour. Multiplemodel-fitting criteria were used, and issues related to datanon-normality, outliers, replicability of the model, sampling error anderror of approximation ill the estimation of final model fit wereaddressed. The final 2-factor model, with estimated error covariancebetween two different pairs of indicator variables, was a good fit onthe trial-1 data, although it was necessary to allow unprotected stretchattends to non-significantly cross-load on factor-2. A 2-factor modelalso fit the trial-2 data from the present analysis, although it wasnecessary to allow closed arm time ratio to negatively cross-load onfactor-1. These results indicate that inferential hypothesis testing andmodel building procedures within a confirmatory factor analysisframework produces interpretable animal anxiety indices in the elevatedplus-maze. Moreover, a 2-factor, rather than a 3-factor model,parsimoniously and unambiguously explained the underlying constructs ofanxiety-like mouse behaviour in the elevated plus-maze in the presentstudy. Taken together, a reduction in the growing number of behaviouralindices reported in elevated plus-maze pharmacological studies issuggested. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The paper then explores the salient issues inthe principle of cost recovery. These are explored from the standpointof the financier and the borrower. It is pointed out that the financierhas obligations and responsibilities to depositors and shareholders. Thepaper then argues that awareness of obligations and responsibilitiesshould be accompanied by practices and procedures that institutionaliseand promote cost recovery. Regarding the borrowers the paper highlightsthe importance of their circumstances within the broader macro-economicsphere. It is then argued that the mode of cost recovery as reflected inthe terms of repayment should as much as possible suit the situation andrequirements of both the borrower and the lender. The discussion thenintroduces the role of ""outsiders"" in cost recovery and how politiciansand busybodies can frustrate the efforts of the financier to recoverfunds invested in housing. The implications of cost recovery are thendrawn out. In this case replicability and investor confidence areemphasised. The results of obsessions with cost recovery are alsooutlined. These points are then illustrated by examples from urbanlow-income housing in Zimbabwe. The study concludes by cautioning thatthe critical issues involved in cost recovery are not exclusivelyfinancial, technical and managerial. Most of the crucial issues relateinstitutional practices and procedures in the face of a multiplicity ofdirect and indirect stakeholders involved. (C) 2000 Elsevier ScienceLtd.

Traditionally,two alternative bill measures have been proposed: bill length measuredfrom the tip to skull (i.e., total culmen), mainly used in Europe, andbill length measured from the tip to the anterior edge of nostrils, usedboth in Europe and America. However, the correlation between bothmeasures as well as the analysis of what they are in fact measuring havenot been explored yet. The aim of this paper is to test in the CitrilFinch (Serinus citrinella) whether measurement of bill length from thetip to the anterior edge of nostrils and total culmen are measuringdifferent components of bill length (e.g., ramphotheca vs. premaxilla),and to assess which is the best measure in relation to their measurementerror. This is specially relevant in granivorous birds for which totalculmen length differs from ramphotheca length. The correlation betweenbill length to nostrils and total culmen was moderate (r = 0.75).Multiple regression of total culmen (dependent variable) on the billcomponents included ramphotheca length (R-2 = 52%) and marginallypremaxilla length to nostrils (R-2 change = 6%, P = 0.06). When usingbill length to nostrils as dependent variable it also includedramphotheca length (R-2 = 60%) and premaxilla length to nostrils (R-2change = 16%, P 0.001). Measurement error was low for bill length tonostrils (ME = 1.6%) but high for total culmen (ME = 26.3%), making thelatter measure not reliable. The replicability of total culmen isprobably decreased in granivorous birds, compared to other passerines,by the fact that in these species the abrupt edge of the ramphothecadiffers from the point at which the culmen meets the skull, whichhinders the location of the end of culmen. All of this highly recommendsthat, specially in granivorous birds, the length of bill should bemeasured from nostril. Our results also show that both bill lengthmeasures are mainly measuring ramphotheca."," 2"," 4"," 0"," 0"," 4"," 0273-8570"," WOS:000166325300004",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Data from 37 study infants (17 fed breast milk and 20 fedcommercial premature formula) revealed that there was no difference inabsolute latencies of waves III and V at baseline; however, the rates ofdecrease of absolute latencies over the study interval weresignificantly greater in infants receiving human milk.Conclusions. Infants fed breast milk have faster brainstem maturation,compared with infants fed formula, based on the rate of maturation ofBAERs.

Nepal is one of 60 countries in which this deficiencyconstitutes a significant public health problem. Each year in Nepal,vitamin A deficiency is responsible for the deaths of 9000 children andfor 2500 children becoming permanently blind. The Nepal National VitaminA Program (NVAP) was begun in 1993 in eight of the country's 75districts. By the end of 1997, the programme covered 32 districts, andby 2003 its coverage will be nationwide.The Nepal NVAP is considered by many to be a highly successful, modelprogramme. It consists primarily of distributing high-dose vitamin Acapsules to all children 6 to 60 months of age during twice-yearlycampaigns. The capsule distribution is carried out by a previouslyexisting network of Female Community Health Volunteers (FCHVs) that hasbeen reinvigorated by the highly visible and universally acclaimedsuccess of the NVAP. An important strategy of the programme has been theempowerment of the FCHVs, which has been accomplished by organizing,training and motivating community workers and other representatives fromeducation, agriculture and other sectors, as well as politicalrepresentatives, to support the FCHVs.The annual cost of the NVAP is US$1.7 million. It costs $1.25 to delivertwo vitamin A capsules to each participant. The cost per averted deathis $327. The NVAP reduces the incidence and severity of diarrhoealdisease and measles, which in turn reduces the need for Ministry ofHealth services, thereby annually saving the Government of Nepal $1.5million. Factoring in these cost savings, the net annual cost of thecurrent NVAP is $167 000, and the net annual cost of the permanent,nationwide programme is estimated at $1.1 million. The NVAP is a highlycost-effective programme. The article concludes with a discussion of thesustainability and replicability of the programme."," 26"," 7"," 0"," 0"," 26"," 0268-1080"," WOS:000087799300004",NA,NA," 10837037",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Compared to results found in adults withsimilar stimulus conditions the stability of the MMN in children seemsto be somewhat lower. The components P1 and N1 to both stimulus types(tone and speech), however, showed a high reliability and individualstability.Conclusion: While MMN is a useful tool to study processing deficits ingroups of children, as e.g. in language-impaired children, MMN as aindividual diagnostic measure should be interpreted very cautiously.

Animal models are needed in whichthese deficits and recovery of the affected functions can beinvestigated. In the present study, the entorhinal area was chosen asthe target for lesioning and for assessing the lesion-induced deficitsin the Morris water maze. The entorhinal cortex is regarded as aninterface between the hippocampus and neocortex. Deafferentiating thehippocampus through entorhinal lesions impairs spatial learning. Theeffects of lesions, induced by either electrocoagulation (experiment 1)or ibotenate excitotoxicity (experiment 2), on spatial orientationbehaviour were investigated. Water maze performance after unilateral orbilateral ibotenate injections into the entorhinal cortex was studied inthe third experiment. In an additional study, the replicability of thespatial learning deficit after lesions induced by bilateral injectionsof ibotenic acid into the entorhinal cortex was assessed by comparingthe results of nine experiments. We found that spatial learning wasimpaired after bilateral lesions aimed at the entorhinal cortex. Theelectrolytic lesion technique produced a relatively large sham effect,whereas the excitotoxic lesioning method did not. Unilateral injectionsof ibotenic acid into the entorhinal cortex did not affect spatialnavigation. The ibotenate induced lesions replicably produced deficitsin the Morris tasks. The degree of the induced spatial learningimpairments and the effects on the rate of acquisition during training,however, differed between experiments. This result suggests that thefundamental biological diversity between shipments of rats can accountfor variation in the effects of parahippocampal damage on spatiallearning even in highly standardized experimental set-ups.Rats lesioned by bilateral injections of ibotenic acid into theentorhinal cortex provide an interesting and reliable model forinvestigating cognitive dysfunctions in neurodegenerative diseases,stroke or traumatic brain injury.

Thus, Fx and HPC lesions result in oppositeeffects in CPP. This is in contrast to spatial learning in the watertask, where both Fx and HPC lesions are associated with acquisitiondeficits. Because it has been demonstrated that damage of dorsal HPC isparticularly disruptive for spatial learning, we tested rats with eitherdorsal or ventral HPC lesions on CPP. To verify replicability ofprevious findings we also tested animals with Fx lesions on the sametask. Lesions limited to dorsal HPC were followed by impairment. Incontrast, lesions limited to ventral HPC resulted in enhanced learning.In agreement with previous data, Fx lesions also resulted in enhancedacquisition. We hypothesize that the effect of dorsal HPC lesions isrelated to interference with spatial learning, while the effect ofventral HPC and Fx lesions suggest increased AMG control of behavior.

TheD-conformation peptides have a potential benefit of enhanced stabilitydue to their resistance to peptidases. Here we report that peptidessynthesized with all D-amino acids are able to prevent fetal death in amouse model of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). The 9 amino acid peptide(SAL) is from activity dependent neurotrophic factor and the 8 aminoacid peptide (NAP) from activity dependent neuroprotective protein.Previously we reported that these peptides in the natural,L-conformation were potent protectors of in utero alcohol-induced fetaldamage (Soc. for Neurosci 1999;25:1009). We chose a model for FAS basedon an acute high exposure to alcohol that provided an outcomeemphasizing the severity of alcohol-induced growth restriction and fetaldeath (Neurobehav Tox.1980 2, 227). For accurate replicability ofalcohol and peptide administration we chose a model utilizingintraperitoneal injection. We chose the highest alcohol dose in themodel (0.03ml/kg) for the most severe test of efficacy. Pregnant C57Bl6Jmice were injected (IP) on gestational day 8 with 25% alcohol or vehiclewith and without D-NAP and D-SAL. Animals were evaluated on gestationalday 18. The fetal demise rate was higher in the alcohol (n=44, 37+-6%)than control (n=44, 7+-2%, P<.001) litters. D-NAP+D-SAL pretreatmentresulted in a fetal death similar to control (n=10, 6+-2%, P=1) andsignificantly less than alcohol (P<.001).
