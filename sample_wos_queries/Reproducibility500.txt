AB BACKGROUND: Dental caries and periodontal disease are the commonest
   bacterial diseases of man and can result in tooth loss. The principal
   method of prevention is the mechanical removal of dental plaque
   augmented by active agents incorporated into toothpastes and
   mouthrinses. In-vitro assays that include complex oral bacterial
   biofilms are required to accurately predict the efficacy of novel active
   agents in vivo. The aim of this study was to develop an oral biofilm
   model using the Calgary biofilm device (CBD) seeded with a natural
   saliva inoculum and analysed by next generation sequencing. The specific
   objectives were to determine the reproducibility and stability of the
   model by comparing the composition of the biofilms over time derived
   from (i) the same volunteers at different time points, and (ii)
   different panels of volunteers.
   RESULTS: Pyrosequencing yielded 280,093 sequences with a mean length of
   432 bases after filtering. A mean of 320 and 250 OTUs were detected in
   pooled saliva and biofilm samples, respectively. Principal coordinates
   analysis (PCoA) plots based on community membership and structure showed
   that replicate biofilm samples were highly similar and clustered
   together. In addition, there were no significant differences between
   biofilms derived from the same panel at different times using analysis
   of molecular variance (AMOVA). There were significant differences
   between biofilms from different panels (AMOVA, P<0.002). PCoA revealed
   that there was a shift in biofilm composition between seven and 14days
   (AMOVA, P<0.001). Veillonella parvula, Veillonella
   atypica/dispar/parvula and Peptostreptococcus stomatis were the
   predominant OTUs detected in seven-day biofilms, whilst Prevotella
   oralis, V. parvula and Streptococcus constellatus were predominant in
   14-day biofilms.
   CONCLUSIONS: Diverse oral biofilms were successfully grown and
   maintained using the CBD. Biofilms derived from the same panel of
   volunteers were highly reproducible. This model could be used to screen
   both antimicrobial-containing oral care products and also novel
   approaches aiming to modify plaque composition, such as pre- or
   probiotics.

AB BACKGROUND: Complaints of the arm, neck, and shoulders (CANS) have a
   multifactorial etiology, and, therefore, their assessment should
   consider both work-related ergonomic and psychosocial aspects. The
   Maastricht Upper Extremity Questionnaire (MUEQ) is one of a few specific
   tools available to evaluate the nature and occurrence of CANS in
   computer-office workers and the impact of psychosocial and ergonomic
   aspects on work conditions. The purpose of the present study was to
   perform a translation and cross-cultural adaptation of the MUEQ to
   Brazilian Portuguese and verify the reliability, internal consistency,
   and structural validity of the MUEQ in Brazilian computer-office
   workers.
   METHODS: The cross-cultural adaptation consisted of five stages (forward
   translation of the MUEQ to Brazilian Portuguese, synthesis of the
   translation, back-translation, expert committee meeting, and the
   pre-final-version test). In the pre-final-version test, 55
   computer-office workers participated. For reproducibility, a sample of
   50 workers completed the questionnaire twice within a one-week interval.
   A sample of 386 workers from the University of Sao Paulo (mean age =
   37.44 years; 95% confidence interval: 36.50-38.38; 216 women and 170
   men) participated on the structural validation and internal consistency
   analysis. Intraclass correlation coefficient was used for the
   statistical analysis of reproducibility, Cronbach's alpha was used for
   internal consistency, and confirmatory factor analysis was used for
   structural validity.
   RESULTS: The calculation of internal consistency, reproducibility, and
   cross validation provided evidence of reliability and lack of
   redundancy. The psychometric properties of the modified MUEQ-Br revised
   were assessed using confirmatory factor analysis, which revealed 6
   factors and 41 questions. For this model, the comparative fit index
   (CFI), goodness-of-fit index (GFI), and non-normed fit index (NNFI) each
   achieved 0.90, and the consistent Akaike information criterion (CAIC),
   chi-square, expected cross-validation index (ECIV), and root mean square
   error of approximation (RMSEA) demonstrated better values.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results provide a basis for using the 41-item MUEQ-Br
   revised for the assessment of computer-office workers' perceptions of
   the psychosocial and ergonomic aspects of CANS and
   musculoskeletal-complaint characterization.

AB BACKGROUND: Two-dimensional (2D) measurements of acetabular morphology
   and orientation are well known; there is less information on these
   acetabular characteristics in three dimensions. One important reason is
   the lack of standardized reference planes for the pelvis, especially in
   relation to the spinopelvic unit; another is that no method precisely
   assesses the acetabulum in three-dimensional (3D) orientation based on
   its axis rather than on the directions of the edges of the acetabular
   rim. We present an objective, highly reliable and accurate, axis-based
   approach to acetabular anthropometry in the measurement of acetabular
   volume and spatial orientation in both normal and pathologic hips. This
   was done using reference planes based on the sacral base (SB) and true
   acetabular axis in 3D computed tomography (CT) pelvic reconstruction.
   METHODS: Radiological examinations of 30 physiologic pelves (60
   acetabula) were included in the study. Reliability and accuracy of the
   method were verified by comparing acetabular angles in 2D pelvic scans
   with 3D reconstructions. We also applied the method to two pathologic
   acetabula.
   RESULTS: Comparison of axis position in the horizontal plane revealed
   significant positive correlations between 2D angle measurements
   (acetabular anteversion angle [AAA] and anterior acetabular index [AAI])
   and 3D measurement of anteversion angle (p<0.001 and p=0.012,
   respectively). In the frontal plane, there was no difference between
   abduction angle, measured on topogram, and inclination angle, obtained
   from a 3D model (p=0.517). In the sagittal plane, there was a
   significant negative correlation between AAA and acetabular tilt
   (p<0.001). Inter- and intra-observer reproducibility was excellent for
   determination of the sacral-base plane and assessment of volume, with
   Fleiss kappa coefficients of 0.850 and 0.783, respectively, and
   intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.900 and 0.950, respectively.
   Inter-observer reproducibility for evaluation of acetabular axis ranged
   from 0.783 to 0.883, and intra-rater reliability ranged from 0.850 to
   0.900 for all 3D angles.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our method is a new, reliable diagnostic tool for assessing
   the acetabula in both normal and pathologic hip joints. The sacral-base
   plane can be used as a stable reference that takes the relationship of
   the acetabulum to the spinopelvic unit into consideration.

AB BACKGROUND: Overexpressing novel antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in plants
   is a promising approach for crop disease resistance engineering.
   However, the in planta stability and subcellular localization of each
   AMP should be validated for the respective plant species, which can be
   challenging due to the small sizes and extreme pI ranges of AMPs which
   limits the utility of standard proteomic gel-based methods. Despite
   recent advances in quantitative shotgun proteomics, its potential for
   AMP analysis has not been utilized and high throughput methods are still
   lacking.
   RESULTS: We created transgenic Nicotiana attenuata plants that
   independently express 10 different AMPs under a constitutive 35S
   promoter and compared the extracellular accumulation of each AMP using a
   universal and versatile protein quantification method. We coupled a
   rapid apoplastic peptide extraction with label-free protein
   quantification by nanoUPLC-MS(E) analysis using Hi3 method and
   identified/quantified 7 of 10 expressed AMPs in the transgenic plants
   ranging from 37 to 91 amino acids in length. The quantitative comparison
   among the transgenic plant lines showed that three particular peptides,
   belonging to the defensin, knottin and lipid-transfer protein families,
   attained the highest concentrations of 91 to 254 pmol per g leaf fresh
   mass, which identified them as best suited for ectopic expression in N.
   attenuata. The chosen mass spectrometric approach proved to be highly
   sensitive in the detection of different AMP types and exhibited the high
   level of analytical reproducibility required for label-free quantitative
   measurements along with a simple protocol required for the sample
   preparation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Heterologous expression of AMPs in plants can result in
   highly variable and non-predictable peptide amounts and we present a
   universal quantitative method to confirm peptide stability and
   extracellular deposition. The method allows for the rapid quantification
   of apoplastic peptides without cumbersome and time-consuming
   purification or chromatographic steps and can be easily adapted to other
   plant species.

AB BACKGROUND: The tetrazolium-based MTT assay has long been regarded as
   the gold standard of cytotoxicity assays as it is highly sensitive and
   has been miniaturised for use as a high-throughput screening assay.
   However, various reports refer to interference by different test
   compounds, including the glycolysis inhibitor 3-bromopyruvate, with the
   conversion of the dye to coloured formazan crystals. This study assessed
   the linear range and reproducibility of three commonly used cell
   enumeration assays; the neutral red uptake (NRU), resazurin reduction
   (RES) and sulforhodamine B (SRB) assays, in comparison to the MTT assay.
   Interference between the MTT assay and three glycolysis inhibitors,
   2-deoxyglucose, 3-bromopyruvate and lonidamine, was investigated.
   RESULTS: Data indicate that the NRU, RES and SRB assays showed the
   smallest variability across the linear range, while the largest
   variation was observed for the MTT assay. This implies that these assays
   would more accurately detect small changes in cell number than the MTT
   assay. The SRB assay provided the most reproducible results as indicated
   by the coefficient of determination after a limited number of
   experiments. The SRB assay also produced the lowest variance in the
   derived 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50), while IC50 concentrations
   of 3-bromopyruvate could not be detected using either the MTT or RES
   assays after 24hours incubation. Interference in the MTT assay was
   observed for all three tested glycolysis inhibitors in a cell-free
   environment. No interferences were observed for the NRU, SRB or RES
   assays.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the MTT assay was not the best
   assay in a number of parameters that must be considered when a cell
   enumeration assay is selected: the MTT assay was less accurate in
   detecting changes in cell number as indicated by the variation observed
   in the linear range, had the highest variation when the IC50
   concentrations of the glycolysis inhibitors were determined, and
   interference between the MTT assay and all the glycolysis inhibitors
   tested were observed. The SRB assay performed best overall considering
   all of the parameters, suggesting that it is the most suitable assay for
   use in preclinical screening of novel therapeutic compounds with
   oxido-reductive potential.

AB BACKGROUND: There is currently no gold standard technique for
   quantifying infarct size (IS) and ischaemic area-at-risk (AAR [oedema])
   on late gadolinium enhancement imaging (LGE) and T2-weighted short tau
   inversion recovery imaging (T2w-STIR) respectively. This study aimed to
   compare the accuracy and reproducibility of IS and AAR quantification on
   LGE and T2w-STIR imaging using Otsu's Automated Technique (OAT) with
   currently used methods at 1.5T and 3.0T post acute ST-segment elevation
   myocardial infarction (STEMI).
   METHODS: Ten patients were assessed at 1.5T and 10 at 3.0T. IS was
   assessed on LGE using 5-8 standard-deviation thresholding (5-8SD),
   full-width half-maximum (FWHM) quantification and OAT. AAR was assessed
   on T2w-STIR using 2SD and OAT. Accuracy was assessed by comparison with
   manual quantification. Interobserver and intraobserver variabilities
   were assessed using Intraclass Correlation Coefficients and Bland-Altman
   analysis. IS using each technique was correlated with left ventricular
   ejection fraction (LVEF).
   RESULTS: FWHM and 8SD-derived IS closely correlated with manual
   assessment at both field strengths (1.5T: 18.3±10.7% LV Mass [LVM] with
   FWHM, 17.7±14.4% LVM with 8SD, 16.5±10.3% LVM with manual
   quantification; 3.0T: 10.8±8.2% LVM with FWHM, 11.4±9.0% LVM with 8SD,
   11.5±9.0% LVM with manual quantification). 5SD and OAT overestimated IS
   at both field strengths. OAT, 2SD and manually quantified AAR closely
   correlated at 1.5T, but OAT overestimated AAR compared with manual
   assessment at 3.0T. IS and AAR derived by FWHM and OAT respectively had
   better reproducibility compared with manual and SD-based quantification.
   FWHM IS correlated strongest with LVEF.
   CONCLUSIONS: FWHM quantification of IS is accurate, reproducible and
   correlates strongly with LVEF, whereas 5SD and OAT overestimate IS. OAT
   accurately assesses AAR at 1.5T and with excellent reproducibility. OAT
   overestimated AAR at 3.0T and thus cannot be recommended as the
   preferred method for AAR quantification at 3.0T.

AB BACKGROUND: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) is a popular next-generation
   sequencing technology used by numerous laboratories with various levels
   of statistical and analytical expertise. Centralized databases, such as
   the Sequence Read Archive and the European Nucleotide Archive, allow
   data to be reanalyzed by independent labs to confirm results and derive
   additional insights. Access to new and shared data highlights the
   necessity for software that both lowers the statistical and analytical
   expertise required to generate results and promotes reproducible
   methodology among laboratories.
   FINDINGS: We have developed fastq2vcf, a pipeline that automates the
   genomic variant calling process using multiple callers. Fastq2vcf offers
   improved flexibility, efficiency, and reproducibility by seamlessly
   integrating several leading sequencing analysis tools. It outputs not
   only the annotated variant call set for each caller, but also the
   consensus variant call set shared by different callers. Furthermore, it
   can be customized and extended easily.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our software tool automatically generates executable
   command lines for a variety of tools required for analyzing WES data. It
   is also highly configurable and provides users with complete control of
   the processing procedure, making it easy to submit and track jobs in
   both single workstation and parallelized computing environments. By
   using this pipeline, WES analysis can be easily reproduced.

AB BACKGROUND: Today, when more than 60% of animal diseases are zoonotic,
   understanding their origin and development and identifying protective
   immune responses in ruminants are major challenges. Robust, efficient
   and cost-effective tools are preconditions to solve these challenges.
   Cytokines play a key role in the main mechanisms by which the immune
   system is balanced in response to infectious pathogens. The cytokine
   balance has thus become the focus of research to characterize immune
   response in ruminants. Currently, SYBR Green reverse transcriptase
   quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is the most widely method used to investigate
   cytokine gene expression in ruminants, but the conditions in which the
   many assays are carried out vary considerably and need to be properly
   evaluated. Accordingly, the quantification of gene expression by RT-qPCR
   requires normalization by multiple reference genes. The objective of the
   present study was thus to develop an RT-qPCR assay to simultaneously
   quantify the expression of several cytokines and reference genes in
   three ruminant species. In this paper, we detail each stage of the
   experimental protocol, check validation parameters and report assay
   performances, following MIQE guidelines.
   RESULTS: Ten novel primer sets were designed to quantify five cytokine
   genes (IL-4, IL-10, IL-12B, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha) and five reference
   genes (ACTB, GAPDH, H3F3A, PPIA and YWHAZ) in cattle, sheep, and goats.
   All the primer sets were designed to span exon-exon boundaries and use
   the same hybridization temperature. Each stage of the RT-qPCR method was
   detailed; their specificity and efficiency checked, proved and are
   reported here, demonstrating the reproducibility of our method, which is
   capable of detecting low levels of cytokine mRNA up to 1 copy whatever
   the species. Finally, we checked the stability of candidate reference
   gene expression, performed absolute quantification of cytokine and
   reference gene mRNA in whole blood samples and relative expression of
   cytokine mRNA in stimulated PBMC samples.
   CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a novel RT-qPCR assay for the
   simultaneous relative quantification of five major cytokines in cattle,
   sheep and goats, and their accurate normalization by five reference
   genes. This accurate and easily reproducible tool can be used to
   investigate ruminant immune responses and is widely accessible to the
   veterinary research community.

   enantiomers using electrokinetic chromatography. The separation was
   achieved using heptakis (2, 3, 6-tri-O-methyl)-beta-cyclodextrin
   (TMbetaCD), a commonly used chiral selector (CS), as it is relatively
   inexpensive and has a low UV absorbance in addition to an anionic
   surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The influence of TMbetaCD
   concentration, phosphate buffer concentration, SDS concentration, buffer
   pH, and applied voltage were investigated. The optimum conditions for
   chiral separation of ketoconazole was achieved using 10mM phosphate
   buffer at pH2.5 containing 20mM TMbetaCD, 5mM SDS, and 1.0% (v/v)
   methanol with an applied voltage of 25kV at 25°C with a 5-s injection
   time (hydrodynamic injection). The four ketoconazole stereoisomers were
   successfully resolved for the first time within 17min (total analysis
   time was 28min including capillary conditioning). The migration time
   precision of this method was examined to give repeatability and
   reproducibility with RSDs ≤5.80% (n =3) and RSDs ≤8.88% (n =9),

AB The copper-soap method, which is based on the absorbance of a fatty
   acid-copper complex at 715nm, is a widely used colorimetric assay to
   determine the lipase activity in reversed micellar system. However, the
   absorbance of the bis(2-ethylhexyl) sodium sulfosuccinate (AOT)-copper
   complex prevents the use of an AOT/isooctane reversed micellar system.
   An extraction step was added to the original procedure to remove AOT and
   eliminate interference from the AOT-copper complex. Among the solvents
   tested, acetonitrile was determined to be the most suitable because it
   allows for the generation of a reproducible calibration curve with oleic
   acid that is independent of the AOT concentrations. Based on the
   validation data, the modified method, which does not experience
   interference from the AOT-copper complex, could be a useful method with
   enhanced accuracy and reproducibility for the lipase assay.

   Chromatography was performed on a Synergi Hydro analytical column with a
   mobile phase of 0.02M ammonium formate in water and acetonitrile, at a

   linearity, carry-over effect, reinjection reproducibility, precision and
   accuracy. The LOD and LOQ values were below 0.8mug/kg and 2.6mug/kg,
   respectively. The proposed method was applied to analyze SFN in honey
   from different botanical origins (rosemary, multifloral, orange blossom
   and heather), and SFN was detected at trace levels in some of the honey
   samples examined.

   vanillin increased significantly at GR-PVP/ABPE compared with bare ABPE,

AB An analytical method was developed and validated for the simultaneous
   determination of four macrocyclic lactones (ML) (abamectin, doramectin,
   ivermectin and moxidectin) in butter, using liquid chromatography with
   fluorescence detection. The method employed heated liquid-liquid
   extraction and a mixture of acetonitrile, ethyl acetate and water, with
   preconcentration and derivatization, to produce stable fluorescent
   derivatives. The chromatographic run time was <12.5min, with excellent
   separation. The method validation followed international guidelines and
   employed fortified butter samples. The figures of merit obtained, e.g.
   recovery (72.4-106.5%), repeatability (8.8%), within-laboratory
   reproducibility (15.7%) and limits of quantification
   (0.09-0.16mugkg(-1)) were satisfactory for the desired application. The
   application of the method to real samples showed that ML residues were
   present in six of the ten samples evaluated. The method proved to be
   simple, easy and appropriate for simultaneous determination of ML
   residues in butter. To our knowledge, this is the first method described
   for the evaluation of ML in butter.

AB In this paper, a simple and sensitive fluorescent sensor for methyl
   parathion is developed based on tyrosine methyl ester ftinctionalized
   carbon dots (Tyr-CDs) and tyrosinase system. The carbon dots are
   obtained by simple hydrothermal reaction using citric acid as carbon
   resource and L-tyrosine methyl ester as modification reagent. The carbon
   dots are characterized by transmission electron microscope, high
   resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction spectrum,
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy. The carbon dots show strong and stable photoluminescence
   with a quantum yield of 3.8%. Tyrosinase can catalyze the oxidation of
   tyrosine methyl ester on the surface of carbon dots to corresponding
   quinone products, which can quench the fluorescence of carbon dots. When
   organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) are introduced in system, they can
   decrease the enzyme activity, thus decrease the fluorescence quenching
   rate. Methyl parathion, as a model of OPs, was detected. Experimental
   results show that the enzyme inhibition rate is proportional to the
   logarithm of the methyl parathion concentration in the range 1.0 x
   10(-10) x 10(-4) M with the detection limit (SIN = 3) of 4.8 x 10(-11)
   M. This determination method shows a low detection limit, wide linear
   range, good selectivity and high reproducibility. This sensing system
   has been successfully used for the analysis of cabbage, milk and fruit
   juice samples. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Electrochemical biosensors have a unique place in determination of

   operation. Unlike chromatographic techniques, electrochemical techniques
   used do not require pre-treatment. Electrochemical biosensors are based
   on amperometric, potentiometric, impedimetric, and conductometric
   principle. Amperometric technique is a commonly used one. Although
   electrochemical biosensors offer a great selectivity and sensitivity for
   early clinical analysis, the poor reproducible results, difficult
   regeneration steps remain primary challenges to the commercialization of
   these biosensors. This review summarizes electrochemical (amperometric,
   potentiometric, impedimetric and conductometric) biosensors for hormone
   detection for the first time in the literature. After a brief
   description of the hormones, the immobilization steps and analytical
   performance of these biosensors are summarized. Linear ranges, LODs,
   reproducibilities, regenerations of developed biosensors are compared.
   Future outlooks in this area are also discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Au@Ag nanorods (Au@AgNRs) was utilized to construct a novel
   sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor for the detection of
   immunoglobulin G (IgG). The sensor was prepared by immoblizing capture
   antibodies on the amine-terminated nanocomposite of carbon
   nanofibers-polyamidoamine dendrimer (CNFs-PAMAM), whilst the trace tag
   was prepared by loading anti-human IgG on Au@AgNRs. The "built-in" Ag
   layer on Au nanorods was characterized by UV-vis extinction spectra,
   transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy. The
   results of cyclic voltammetry indicated that modifying CNFs-PAMAM
   nanocomposite on glassy carbon electrode enabled 177 times of peak
   current increase of Ag in the bimetallic nanorods. The peak current was
   quantitatively related with the concentration of the target protein IgG
   via the formation of immunocomplex. After the parameter optimization,
   the oxidative peak current of silver was proportional to the
   concentration of IgG in a wide linear range of six orders of magnitude
   with a low detection limit of 0.5 fg mL(-1). Besides, this sensor showed
   acceptable reproducibility and stability, and thus the strategy reported
   here has great promise for extension to the other disease biomarkers.

   nanosensor for lead (II) detection based on biocompatible graphene
   quantum dots and graphene oxide by employment of Pb2+-induced

   between graphene quantum dots and graphene oxide, and subsequent

   aptamer-Pb2+ complex triggered by the addition of Pb2+. This nanosensor
   can distinguish Pb2+ ion from other ions with high sensitivity and good

AB A simple and low-cost DNA sensing platform based on Pb2+-specific
   DNAzyme-modified microplate was successfully developed for highly
   sensitive monitoring of lead ion (Pb2+, one kind of toxic heavy metal
   ion) in the environmental samples coupling with a portable personal
   glucometer (PGM)-based detection mode. The detection cell was first
   prepared simply by means of immobilizing the DNAzyme on the
   streptavidin-modified microplate. Gold nanoparticle labeled with
   single-stranded DNA and invertase (Enz-AuNP-DNA) was utilized as the
   signal-transduction tag to produce PGM substrate (glucose). Upon
   addition of lead ion into the microplate, the substrate strand of the
   immobilized DNAzyme was catalytically cleaved by target Pb2+, and the
   newly generated single-strand DNA in the microplate could hybridize
   again with the single-stranded DNA on the Enz-AuNP-DNA. Accompanying
   with the Enz-AuNP-DNA, the carried invertase could convert sucrose into
   glucose. The as-produced glucose could be monitored by using a widely
   accessible PGM for in situ amplified digital readout. Based on
   Enz-AuNP-DNA amplification strategy, as low as 1.0 pM Pb2+ could be
   detected under the optimal conditions. Moreover, the methodology also
   showed good reproducibility and high selectivity toward target Pb2+
   against other metal ions because of highly specific Pb2+-dependent
   DNAzyme, and was applicable for monitoring Pb2+ in the naturally
   contaminated sewage and spiked drinking water samples. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   obtained on the AChE/CNT-NH2/GC electrode. Furthermore, the biosensor
   modified with CNT-NH2 showed a high affinity to acetylthiocholine
   chloride (ATCh) and could catalyze the hydrolysis of ATCh with an

AB A simple and label-free electrochemical aptasensor was developed for

   between aptamer and E2 into the measurable electrochemical signal, the
   nickel hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles (NiHCF NPs) as signal probe was in
   situ introduced on the electrode by a simple two-step deposition method,
   exhibiting well-defined peaks with good stability and reproducibility.
   Subsequently, Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) was covered on the NiHCF NPs,
   which not only provided a platform for immobilizing the aptamer by S-Au
   interaction, but further enhanced the conductivity and stability of the
   signal probe. With the addition of E2, the formation of E2-aptamer
   complexes on the sensing interface retarded the interfacial electron
   transfer reaction of the probe, resulting in the decrease of the
   electrochemical signal. E2 could be readily examined by measuring the
   signal change. A linear range of 1 x 10(-12)-6 x 10(-10) M was obtained
   with a low detection limit of 0.8 x 10(-12) M. The aptasensor also
   exhibited high specificity to E2 in control experiments employing seven
   endocrine disrupting compounds as the interferents that had similar
   structure or coexisted with E2 in the environment. Besides, the
   applicability of the aptasensor was successfully evaluated by

AB The identification of biocompatible nanomaterials with high

   electrochemical cytosensors. We prepared a novel protein-inorganic
   nano-material-bovine serum albumin (BSA) incorporated Ag nanoflowers
   with three-dimensional porous architectures, using a simple biomimetic
   method. The BSA-incorporated Ag nanoflowers were modified on a glassy
   carbon electrode (GCE) surface and conjugated with a targeting lectin
   molecule, i.e., Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA), for sensing DLD-1 human
   colon cancer cells. The BSA-incorporated Ag nanoflowers were a suitable
   platform, and showed improved cell-immobilization capacity, and good
   bio-compatibility, with retention of activity of the immobilized cells.
   These properties are attributed to the large surface area of the porous
   structure and the natural BSA layer acting as a biocompatible support.
   The attachment of DLD-1 cells to the GCE increased the electron-transfer
   resistance, with a good correlation with the logarithm of the
   concentration from 1.35 x 10(2) to 1.35 x 10(7) cells mL(-1), with a low
   detection limit of 40 cells mL(-1). Based on the affinity between SNA
   and sialic acid (SA), the UV-vis absorption spectrum of the one-step
   reaction between SA and acidic ninhydrin indicated that the average
   number of SA molecules on a single living DLD-1 cell surface was
   approximately 2.16 x 10(12). This proposed cytosensing strategy had good
   reproducibility, acceptable precision, and high specificity for
   SA-over-expressed cells, indicating that it has potential applications
   for the early monitoring of tumor cells and convenient evaluation of SA

   a novel signal amplification strategy in this work. Carbon decorated
   Fe3O4 magnetic microspheres (Fe3O4@C) with large specific surface area
   and good adsorption property were used as labels to anchor palladium
   nanoparticles (Pd NPs) and the secondary antibodies (Ab(2)). Pd NPs were
   loaded on Fe3O4@C to obtain Fe3O4@C@Pd with core-shell structure by
   electrostatic attraction, which were further used to immobilize Ab(2)
   due to the bonding of Pd-NH2. A signal amplification strategy was the
   noble metal nanoparticles, such as Pd NPs, exhibiting high
   electrocatalytic activities toward hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) reduction.
   This signal amplification was novel not only because of the great
   capacity, but also the ease of magnetic separation from the sample
   solution based on their magnetic property. Moreover,
   carboxyl-functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs-COOH) were
   used for the immobilization of primary antibodies (Ab(1)). Therefore,
   high sensitivity could be realized by the designed immunosensor based on
   this novel signal amplification strategy. Under optimal conditions, the
   immunosensor exhibited a wide linear range of 0.5 pg/mL to 10 ng/mL
   toward AFP with a detection limit of 0.16 pg/mL (S/N=3). Moreover, it
   revealed good selectivity, acceptable reproducibility and stability,

AB A novel imprinted sol-gel electrochemical sensor for the determination
   of propyl gallate (PG) was developed based on a composite of graphene
   and single walled carbon nanotubes (GR-SWCNTs). It was fabricated by
   stepwise modifying GR-SWCNTs and molecularly imprinted polymers and
   stored in 0.10 mol L-1 phosphate buffer solution pH 6.0, which endowed
   the sensor good sensitivity and selective recognition towards template
   molecules. The morphology and specific adsorption capacity of the sensor
   was characterized by scanning electron microscope and electrochemical
   methods, respectively. Under the optimized conditions, a linear range of
   the sensor to PG was 8.0 x 10(-8)-2.6 x 10(-3) mol L-1 with a limit of
   detection of 5.0 x 10(-8) mol L-1 (S/N = 3). The sensor exhibited
   specificity and selectivity towards template molecules as well as
   excellent reproducibility, regeneration and stability. Furthermore, the
   sensor could be applied to determine PG in edible oils, instant noodles
   and cookies with satisfactory results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB For the first time, we proposed a high-throughput method to quantify
   glutathione in grapes, musts and wines for all grape varieties using
   Stable Isotope Dilution Assay (SIDA). Indeed, the use of SIDA as a
   quantification method is essential to overcome the chemical instability
   of glutathione. In practice, glutathione was derivatized in-situ with
   N-ethylmaleimide to block the cysteine residue and to enhance its
   lipophilic properties. After quenching with acetic acid, samples were
   directly analyzed by LC-MS/MS (run of 13 min) in Multiple Reaction
   Monitoring mode using labeled glutathione as internal standard. The
   validation according to the International Organization of Vine and Wine
   recommendations demonstrated the high sensitivity (LOD = 45 mu g L-1),
   accuracy (recovery = 112%) and intermediate reproducibility (RSD = 12%)
   of the method. This high-throughput method that requires only 1 mL of
   matrix, allowed us to analyze 70 samples per day for a moderate cost.

   (AChE) onto amino functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNT-NH 2), in order
   to fabricate high sensitive and practical organophosphorus pesticide
   (OPs) biosensors. Compared with the pristine, -COOH and -OH decorated
   CNTs, there were larger amount of enzymes adsorbed on the surface of
   CNT-NH 2 with a favorable orientation and the best amperometric response
   was obtained on the AChE/CNT-NH 2/GC electrode. Furthermore, the
   biosensor modified with CNT-NH 2 showed a high affinity to
   acetylthiocholine chloride (ATCh) and could catalyze the hydrolysis of
   ATCh with an apparent Michaelis-Menten constant ( Km) value of 67.4 muM.
   Using paraoxon as a model compound, wide linear ranges from 0.2 nM to 1
   nM and 1 nM to 30 nM, and a low detection limit of 0.08 nM were obtained
   with satisfactory reproducibility and stability. Moreover, the biosensor
   had also been successfully employed for the determination of low
   concentrations of pesticides in real vegetable samples. This method
   could be extended to other functionalized nano-materials for their
   application in constructing biosensors. [All rights reserved Elsevier].

AB The identification of biocompatible nanomaterials with high
   conductivities as sensing interfaces is important in developing novel
   electrochemical cytosensors. We prepared a novel protein-inorganic
   nanomaterial-bovine serum albumin (BSA) incorporated Ag nanoflowers with
   three-dimensional porous architectures, using a simple biomimetic
   method. The BSA-incorporated Ag nanoflowers were modified on a glassy
   carbon electrode (GCE) surface and conjugated with a targeting lectin
   molecule, i.e.,  Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA), for sensing DLD-1
   human colon cancer cells. The BSA-incorporated Ag nanoflowers were a
   suitable platform, and showed improved cell-immobilization capacity, and
   good biocompatibility, with retention of activity of the immobilized
   cells. These properties are attributed to the large surface area of the
   porous structure and the natural BSA layer acting as a biocompatible
   support. The attachment of DLD-1 cells to the GCE increased the
   electron-transfer resistance, with a good correlation with the logarithm
   of the concentration from 1.35times10 2 to 1.35times10 7 cells mL -1,
   with a low detection limit of 40 cells mL -1. Based on the affinity
   between SNA and sialic acid (SA), the UV-vis absorption spectrum of the
   one-step reaction between SA and acidic ninhydrin indicated that the
   average number of SA molecules on a single living DLD-1 cell surface was
   approximately 2.16times10 12. This proposed cytosensing strategy had
   good reproducibility, acceptable precision, and high specificity for
   SA-over-expressed cells, indicating that it has potential applications
   for the early monitoring of tumor cells and convenient evaluation of SA
   on living cells. [All rights reserved Elsevier].

AB A simple and low-cost DNA sensing platform based on Pb 2+-specific
   DNAzyme-modified microplate was successfully developed for highly
   sensitive monitoring of lead ion (Pb 2+, one kind of toxic heavy metal
   ion) in the environmental samples coupling with a portable personal
   glucometer (PGM)-based detection mode. The detection cell was first
   prepared simply by means of immobilizing the DNAzyme on the
   streptavidin-modified microplate. Gold nanoparticle labeled with
   single-stranded DNA and invertase (Enz-AuNP-DNA) was utilized as the
   signal-transduction tag to produce PGM substrate (glucose). Upon
   addition of lead ion into the microplate, the substrate strand of the
   immobilized DNAzyme was catalytically cleaved by target Pb 2+, and the
   newly generated single-strand DNA in the microplate could hybridize
   again with the single-stranded DNA on the Enz-AuNP-DNA. Accompanying
   with the Enz-AuNP-DNA, the carried invertase could convert sucrose into
   glucose. The as-produced glucose could be monitored by using a widely
   accessible PGM for  in situ amplified digital readout. Based on
   Enz-AuNP-DNA amplification strategy, as low as 1.0 pM Pb 2+ could be
   detected under the optimal conditions. Moreover, the methodology also
   showed good reproducibility and high selectivity toward target Pb 2+
   against other metal ions because of highly specific Pb 2+-dependent
   DNAzyme, and was applicable for monitoring Pb 2+ in the naturally
   contaminated sewage and spiked drinking water samples. [All rights

AB In this paper, a simple and sensitive fluorescent sensor for methyl
   parathion is developed based on l-tyrosine methyl ester functionalized
   carbon dots (Tyr-CDs) and tyrosinase system. The carbon dots are
   obtained by simple hydrothermal reaction using citric acid as carbon
   resource and l-tyrosine methyl ester as modification reagent. The carbon
   dots are characterized by transmission electron microscope, high
   resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction spectrum,
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy. The carbon dots show strong and stable photoluminescence
   with a quantum yield of 3.8%. Tyrosinase can catalyze the oxidation of
   tyrosine methyl ester on the surface of carbon dots to corresponding
   quinone products, which can quench the fluorescence of carbon dots. When
   organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) are introduced in system, they can
   decrease the enzyme activity, thus decrease the fluorescence quenching
   rate. Methyl parathion, as a model of OPs, was detected. Experimental
   results show that the enzyme inhibition rate is proportional to the
   logarithm of the methyl parathion concentration in the range 1.0times10
   -10-1.0times10 -4 M with the detection limit ( S/ N=3) of 4.8times10 -11
   M. This determination method shows a low detection limit, wide linear
   range, good selectivity and high reproducibility. This sensing system
   has been successfully used for the analysis of cabbage, milk and fruit
   juice samples. [All rights reserved Elsevier].

AB An ultrasensitive sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor for
   quantitative detection of alpha fetoprotein (AFP) was proposed based on
   a novel signal amplification strategy in this work. Carbon decorated Fe
   3O 4 magnetic microspheres (Fe 3O 4@C) with large specific surface area
   and good adsorption property were used as labels to anchor palladium
   nanoparticles (Pd NPs) and the secondary antibodies (Ab 2). Pd NPs were
   loaded on Fe 3O 4@C to obtain Fe 3O 4@C@Pd with core-shell structure by
   electrostatic attraction, which were further used to immobilize Ab 2 due
   to the bonding of Pd-NH 2. A signal amplification strategy was the noble
   metal nanoparticles, such as Pd NPs, exhibiting high electrocatalytic
   activities toward hydrogen peroxide (H 2O 2) reduction. This signal
   amplification was novel not only because of the great capacity, but also
   the ease of magnetic separation from the sample solution based on their
   magnetic property. Moreover, carboxyl-functionalized multi-walled carbon
   nanotubes (MWCNTs-COOH) were used for the immobilization of primary
   antibodies (Ab 1). Therefore, high sensitivity could be realized by the
   designed immunosensor based on this novel signal amplification strategy.
   Under optimal conditions, the immunosensor exhibited a wide linear range
   of 0.5 pg/mL to 10 ng/mL toward AFP with a detection limit of 0.16 pg/mL
   ( S/ N=3). Moreover, it revealed good selectivity, acceptable
   reproducibility and stability, indicating a potential application in
   clinical monitoring of tumor biomarkers. [All rights reserved Elsevier].

AB A simple and label-free electrochemical aptasensor was developed for
   detecting 17beta-estradiol (E2). To translate the binding events between
   aptamer and E2 into the measurable electrochemical signal, the nickel
   hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles (NiHCF NPs) as signal probe was in situ
   introduced on the electrode by a simple two-step deposition method,
   exhibiting well-defined peaks with good stability and reproducibility.
   Subsequently, Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) was covered on the NiHCF NPs,
   which not only provided a platform for immobilizing the aptamer by S-Au
   interaction, but further enhanced the conductivity and stability of the
   signal probe. With the addition of E2, the formation of E2-aptamer
   complexes on the sensing interface retarded the interfacial electron
   transfer reaction of the probe, resulting in the decrease of the
   electrochemical signal. E2 could be readily examined by measuring the
   signal change. A linear range of 1times10 -12-6times10 -10 M was
   obtained with a low detection limit of 0.8times10 -12 M. The aptasensor
   also exhibited high specificity to E2 in control experiments employing
   seven endocrine disrupting compounds as the interferents that had
   similar structure or coexisted with E2 in the environment. Besides, the
   applicability of the aptasensor was successfully evaluated by
   determining E2 in the real samples. [All rights reserved Elsevier].

   antibodies on the amine-terminated nanocomposite of carbon
   nanofibers-polyamidoamine dendrimer (CNFs-PAMAM), whilst the trace tag
   was prepared by loading anti-human IgG on Au@AgNRs. The
   ldquobuilt-inrdquo Ag layer on Au nanorods was characterized by UV-vis
   extinction spectra, transmission electron microscopy and energy
   dispersive spectroscopy. The results of cyclic voltammetry indicated
   that modifying CNFs-PAMAM nanocomposite on glassy carbon electrode
   enabled 177 times of peak current increase of Ag in the bimetallic
   nanorods. The peak current was quantitatively related with the
   concentration of the target protein IgG via the formation of
   immunocomplex. After the parameter optimization, the oxidative peak
   current of silver was proportional to the concentration of IgG in a wide
   linear range of six orders of magnitude with a low detection limit of
   0.5 fg mL -1. Besides, this sensor showed acceptable reproducibility and

   amplification efficiency, very little nonspecific adsorption with good

AB We present a universal protocol for quick and reproducible conductivity
   determinations in bioapplications using electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopy (EIS), electrode modification and automated spectral
   analysis. Two-terminal EIS measurements may be acquired using any
   standard impedance analyser adjusting the applied sinusoidal potential
   and frequency range for spectral analysis. An implemented Matlab
   algorithm displays the acquired spectra, automatically identifies the
   frequency at which the phase angle (phi) is closest to 0 degrees and
   determines the impedance magnitude, i.e. the solution resistance (R-S).
   The corresponding conductivity value is immediately calculated as the
   ratio of the conductivity cell constant (kappa), determined based on
   calibration, and R-S. This protocol eliminates the need for evaluating a
   specific equivalent circuit followed by non-linear regression based
   curve fitting that is generally required in EIS-based conductivity
   determinations. The protocol is applicable to conductivity
   determinations using different conductivity cell configurations in any
   electrolyte solution regardless of its composition, i.e. in solutions
   with or without electroactive species that give rise to faradaic
   interface impedance. Conducted measurements showed high reproducibility
   in good agreement with a commercial conductometer in a wide range of
   ionic strengths up to five times that of physiological PBS. Since
   measurements in cell culture medium with bare gold electrodes indicated
   the need for recalibration to counteract the effect of biomolecule
   physisorption, the validity of the protocol was further extended using a
   protein-repellent coating of poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether thiol
   self-assembled monolayer. This effectively eliminated electrode fouling,
   facilitating high reproducibility in repeated conductivity
   determinations in the presence of proteins. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

AB A fabrication process for Nb/Al-AlOx/Nb Josephson junctions (JJs) with
   sizes down to 200 nm has been developed on a 200-mm-wafer tool set
   typical for CMOS foundry. This process is the core of several nodes of a
   roadmap for fully-planarized fabrication processes for superconductor
   integrated circuits with 4, 8, and 10 niobium layers developed at MIT
   Lincoln Laboratory. The process utilizes 248 nm photolithography,
   anodization, high-density plasma etching, and chemical mechanical
   polishing (CMP) for planarization of SiO2 interlayer dielectric. JJ
   electric properties and statistics such as on-chip and wafer spreads of
   critical current, I-c, normal-state conductance, G(N), and run-to-run
   reproducibility have been measured on 200-mm wafers over a broad range
   of JJ diameters from 200 nm to 1500 nm and critical current densities,
   J(c), from 10 kA/cm(2) to 50 kA/cm(2) where the JJs become self-shunted.
   Diffraction-limited photolithography of JJs is discussed. A relationship
   between JJ mask size, JJ size on wafer, and the minimum printable size
   for coherent and partially coherent illumination has been worked out.
   The G(N) and I-c spreads obtained have been found to be mainly caused by
   variations of the JJ areas and agree with the model accounting for an
   enhancement of mask errors near the diffraction-limited minimum
   printable size of JJs. I-c and G(N) spreads from 0.8% to 3% have been
   obtained for JJs with sizes from 1500 nm down to 500 nm. The spreads
   increase to about 8% for 200-nm JJs. Prospects for circuit densities >
   10(6) JJ/cm(2) and 193-nm photolithography for JJ definition are
   discussed.

   lactate method in competitive cyclists. Twenty-eight male, well-trained
   cyclists (30.2 ± 10.1 years, 72.0 ± 7.4 kg, 177.3 ± 4.7 cm) were
   recruited to participate in this study. Cyclists completed two
   incremental cycling tests to exhaustion over a period of 7 days to
   determine their peak power output, maximal oxygen uptake, maximal heart
   rate, maximal blood lactate concentration and two lactate turnpoint
   criteria. The fixed blood concentration criterion (3.5 mM) and an
   individual criterion were assessed by a lactate-power curve, considering
   power output, heart rate and oxygen uptake. The main finding of this
   study was that both lactate turnpoint criteria showed identical low
   within-subject variation for power output (2.8% coefficient of
   variation). High values for test-retest correlations ranging from r =
   0.70 to r = 0.94 were found for all variables in both threshold
   criteria. In conclusion, the individual and fixed method to determine
   the second lactate turnpoint showed similar high absolute and relative
   reliability in competitive cyclists.

AB Check-all-that-apply (CATA) questions continue to gain popularity and
   attract interest in developing guidelines regarding their implementation
   and analysis. The current research continues on this path and considers
   visual attention by consumers to CATA questions. This is a pre-requisite
   for elicitation of valid data. Extending previous research, we consider
   whether CATA question list length influences consumers' visual attention
   to the task when it moderately increases from 12 to 20 terms. In a study
   with six wheat crackers consumers (n similar to 120) used a CATA
   questions with either a "short" list (12 terms) or a "long" list (20
   terms). The main difference in visual processing was less attention to
   individual CATA terms when using "long" lists, but greater sustained
   visual attention to the task. The sensory characterisations for wheat
   crackers elicited by "long" and "short" lists differed only in minor
   ways, pointing to little practical impact of the observed differences in
   visual processing. Upon replication of the current results,
   consideration of how these findings generalise to test situations with
   longer CATA questions (30+ terms), tests with fewer/more samples and/or
   samples with more complex sensory characteristics is warranted. (C) 2015

AB In recent years methodological research into application of CATA
   questions has gained momentum. Yet, key questions for this approach
   remain unaddressed - how to generate the sensory terms that populate
   CATA questions and how many terms should be used. The second of these
   questions was addressed in seven consumer studies, involving a total of
   735 consumers and five product categories (crackers, cheese,
   fruit-flavored drinks, chocolate, milk desserts). Sensory product
   characterizations elicited with "short" and "long" CATA questions (10-17
   terms vs. 20-28 terms) were compared on a number of criteria such as
   frequency of CATA term use, product differences, spatial configurations
   (samples and terms) and task perceptions. Two strategies for generating
   "long" lists of CATA terms were examined: adding synonym terms to those
   already featuring on the "short" list (e.g., 'hard' and 'firm'), and
   adding antonym terms to those already featuring on the "short" list
   (e.g., 'hard' and 'not hard' or 'natural' and 'artificial').
   Between-subjects experimental designs were used to compare product
   characterizations from "short" and "long" CATA questions. Results
   revealed that "short" and "long" lists of CATA terms generated largely
   similar results. In general, sample configurations were very similar, as
   were task perceptions. However, there were, at times, differences in
   frequency of CATA term use and term configurations, as well as instances
   where conclusions about sample differences depended on whether "short"
   or "long" CATA lists were used. Additionally, here was some evidence
   that CATA questions with "long" lists of synonym or antonym terms may
   cause a "dilution" effect of the responses. This fits expectations of
   idiosyncrasy in consumer perception/expression of sensory stimuli, but
   may be associated with reduced discriminatory ability of the CATA
   question. How to best balance these opposing considerations is deserving
   of further investigation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study concerns a novel symbolic cognitive vision framework emerged
   from the Cognitive Microscopy (MICO(1)) initiative. MICO aims at
   supporting the evolution towards digital pathology, by studying
   cognitive clinical-compliant protocols involving routine virtual
   microscopy. We instantiate this paradigm in the case of mitotic count as
   a component of breast cancer grading in histopathology. The key concept
   of our approach is the role of the semantics as driver of the whole
   slide image analysis protocol. All the decisions being taken into a
   semantic and formal world, MICO represents a knowledge-driven platform
   for digital histopathology. Therefore, the core of this initiative is
   the knowledge representation and the reasoning. Pathologists' knowledge
   and strategies are used to efficiently guide image analysis algorithms.
   In this sense, hard-coded knowledge, semantic and usability gaps are to
   be reduced by a leading, active role of reasoning and of semantic
   approaches. Integrating ontologies and reasoning in confluence with
   modular imaging algorithms, allows the emergence of new
   clinical-compliant protocols for digital pathology. This represents a
   promising way to solve decision reproducibility and traceability issues
   in digital histopathology, while increasing the flexibility of the
   platform and pathologists' acceptance, the one always having the legal
   responsibility in the diagnosis process. The proposed protocols open the
   way to increasingly reliable cancer assessment (i.e. multiple slides per
   sample analysis), quantifiable and traceable second opinion for cancer
   grading, and modern capabilities for cancer research support in
   histopathology (i.e. content and context-based indexing and retrieval).
   Last, but not least, the generic approach introduced here is applicable
   for number of additional challenges, related to molecular imaging and,
   in general, to high-content image exploration.

AB The tilted head race track coils of the EDIPO test facility are wound
   with cable-in-conduit conductors made by high current density Nb 3Sn
   strands, J c = 2400 A/mm 2 at 12 T 4.2 K. Since the commissioning of the
   coils, frequent voltage spikes were observed at the quench detection
   taps during the low current range of operation, completely disappearing
   above 2 T. The large amplitude of some spikes triggered the quench
   detection system: the parameters for protection (voltage thresholds and
   validation time) had to be modified for the voltage pairs monitoring the
   windings. The occurrence of partial flux jumps in the high current
   density strands is known from former characterization. The fast data
   acquisition of the quench detection system, with 800 Hz sampling
   frequency, allows investigation of the dynamics and propagation of the
   voltage spikes in the various layers of the winding. From the collected
   data of several runs of operation, statistics of amplitude, initial
   location, propagation and reproducibility were drawn, looking also for
   correlation with the operation history, e.g., first cool-down, ramp up
   versus ramp down, ramp rate, etc. The energy released by the flux jumps
   is conservatively estimated by the time integration of the voltage
   spikes and discussed in terms of energy margin and heat removal rate in
   the layers. In conclusion, the limitation of the use of high current
   density Nb 3Sn strands in high current conductors is discussed.

AB Milk protects the health of newborns because it contains essential

   objective of this study was to develop and validate a technique for
   extracting total phenolic compounds (TPCs) from a milk matrix and then
   analyzing them using the Folin-Ciocalteu method. The extraction
   technique was applied to goat milk and involved the addition of
   methanol, acetonitrile, and Carrez I and II reagents, after which
   protein was separated from fat through centrifugation. Subsequently, the
   technique was applied to goat (69.03 +/- 6.23 mg GAE/L), cow (49.00 +/-
   10.77 mg GAE/L), sheep (167.6 +/- 58.77 mg GAE/L) and human milk (82.45
   +/- 12.3 mg GAE/L). The technique showed an acceptable linearity (R-2 =
   0.9998), limit of detection (6.03 mg GAE/L) and quantification (16.2 mg
   GAE/L), repeatability (RSD = 4%), reproducibility (RSD = 6.8%) and
   recovery (>85.41%); it is thus effective and can be used in the routine
   analysis of milk. TPCs obtained from each type of milk indicate a high
   variability among species and among members of the same species. (C)

   synthesized HCNFs were characterized with scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high resolution transmission electron

   (AuNPs). The results indicated that the Au/HCNFs nanoconnposites
   exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity to the reduction of H2O2,
   offering a wide linear range from 1.0 mu M to 3157 mu M with a detection
   limit as low as 0.46 AM. The apparent Michaelis-Menten constant of the
   biosensor was 0.61 mM. The as-fabricated biosensor showed a rapid and
   sensitive amperometric response to hydrogen peroxide with acceptable
   preparation reproducibility and excellent stability. Because of their
   low cost and high stability, these novel HCNFs represent seem to be a

   simultaneous determination of adenine and guanine. The CdSe QDs-GO
   nanocomposite was prepared by ultrasonication and was characterized with
   spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. The nanocomposite modified
   electrode was characterized by cyclic voltannmetry (CV). The modified
   electrode showed excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the
   oxidative determination of adenine and guanine with a good peak
   separation of 0.31 V. This may be due to the high surface area and fast
   electron transfer kinetics of the nanoconnposite. The modified electrode
   exhibited wide linear ranges from 0.167 mu M to 245 mu M for Guanine and
   0.083 mu M to 291 mu M for Adenine with detection limits of 0.055 mu M
   Guanine and 0.028 mu M of Adenine (S/N = 3) respectively. Further, the
   modified electrode was used for the quantitative determination of
   adenine and guanine in herring sperm DNA with satisfactory results. The
   modified electrode showed acceptable selectivity, reproducibility and
   stability under optimal conditions.

AB Inductance of superconducting thin-film inductors and structures with
   linewidth down to 250 nm has been experimentally evaluated. The
   inductors include various striplines and microstrips, their 90deg bends
   and meanders, interlayer vias, etc., typically used in superconducting
   digital circuits. The circuits have been fabricated by a fully
   planarized process with 8 niobium layers, developed at MIT Lincoln
   Laboratory for very-large-scale superconducting integrated circuits.
   Excellent run-to-run reproducibility and inductance uniformity of better
   than 1% across 200-mm wafers have been found. It has been found that the
   inductance per unit length of stripline and microstrip line inductors
   continues to grow as the inductor linewidth is reduced deep into the
   submicron range to the widths comparable to the film thickness and
   magnetic field penetration depth. It is shown that the linewidth
   reduction does not lead to widening of the parameter spread due to
   diminishing sensitivity of the inductance to the linewidth and
   dielectric thickness. The experimental results were compared with
   numeric inductance extraction using commercial software and freeware,
   and a good agreement was found for 3-D inductance extractors. Methods of
   further miniaturization of circuit inductors for achieving circuit
   densities> 10 6 Josephson junctions per cm 2 are discussed.

AB An innovative hydrophilic and anti-fouling coating material for
   application in membrane technology for wastewater treatment has been
   developed by polymerization of a polymerizable bicontinuous
   micro-emulsion (PBM) and used for surface modification of a commercial
   flat polyethersulfone (PES) membrane. The novel nanostructured coating
   has been produced using acryloyloxyundecyltriethylammonium bromide
   (AUTEAB) as a co-polymerizable surfactant, obtained through a synthetic
   method characterized by a lower cost and a higher reproducibility
   compared to other known polymerizable surfactants. The novel composite
   membranes have been characterized and compared with the uncoated PES
   membranes. Coated membranes resulted in a smoother surface and a higher
   hydrophilicity with respect to the uncoated ones, and showed a
   particular nano size channel like morphology making them highly
   resistant to the fouling phenomenon. The covalent anchorage of the
   surfactant on the membrane surface ensured the embedment of the molecule
   in the polymeric matrix avoiding its leaching and also leading the
   coated membranes to have significant antimicrobial activity, which is
   very important for reducing the biolouling phenomenon.
   All these aspects make the tailored coating material an ideal and
   efficient coating for modifications of commercial membrane surfaces, to
   be used in membrane processes in wastewater treatment. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   is reported. Firstly, we employed a facile approach to synthesize PtPd
   nanoparticles (PtPd NPs) on chemically reduced graphene oxide (RGO)

   Owing to the PDA layer as well as the synergistic effect of PtPd NPs,
   the fabricated SOD/PtPd-PDARGO sensor exhibited an outstanding
   sensitivity of 909.7 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) upon O-2(center dot-) in a
   linear range from 0.016 mM to 0.24 mM (R-2=0.992), with a low detection

PY 2015
AB The management of odorous emissions from sewer networks has become an
   important issue for sewer operators resulting in the need to better
   understand the composition of volatile organic sulfur compounds (VOSCs).
   In order to characterise the composition of such malodorous emissions, a
   method based on thermal desorption (TD) and gas chromatography coupled
   to sulfur chemiluminescence detector (GC-SCD) has been developed to
   determine a broader range of VOSCs, hydrogen sulfide (H2S), methanethiol
   (MeSH), ethanethiol (EtSH), dimethyl sulfide (DMS), carbon disulfide
   (CS2), ethylmethyl sulfide (EMS), 1-butanethiol (1-BuSH), dimethyl
   disulfide (DMDS), diethyl disulfide (DEDS), and dimethyl trisulfide
   (DMTS). Parameters affecting the chromatographic behaviour of the target
   compounds were studied (e.g., temperature program, carrier gas velocity)
   as well as the experimental conditions affecting the
   adsorption/desorption process (temperature, flow and time). Optimised
   extraction of VOSCs samples was achieved under adsorption temperatures
   of less than -20 degrees C, and a desorption flow rate of similar to 6
   ml/min. Active collection on the cold trap enabled a small gas volume of
   50-100 ml to be sampled for all analytes without breakthrough.
   Calibration curves were derived at different 11) loading volumes with
   determined linearity ranging between 0.09 ng and 60.1 ng. The method
   detection limits (MDLs) were in the range of 0.10-5.26 mu g/m(3) with TD
   recoveries higher than 66% and reproducibility (relative standard
   deviation values) between 1.8% and 6.1% being obtained for all
   compounds. The VOSCs characterisation at different sewerage collection
   sites in Sydney, Australia (for seasonal, weekly and diurnal) showed
   that six of the ten targeted compounds were consistently detected at all
   sample events. Diurnal patterns of VOSCs investigated were clearly
   observed with the highest concentration occurring after 12 pm (noon) for
   H2S and MeSH. The consecutive 5 day analysis showed no significant
   difference in the targeted VOSCs concentrations and demonstrated the
   suitability of the method for routine sewer VOSCs emission measurements.

   synergistic effect of GNs (large surface area and high conductivity),
   NiNPs (high electrocatalytic activity towards the glucose oxidation) and
   CS (good film-forming and antifouling ability), a nonenzymatic

   displays greatly enhanced electrocatalytic activity towards the glucose
   oxidation in NaOH solution. The PVP-GNs-NiNPs-CS based electrochemical
   glucose sensor demonstrates good sensitivity, wide linear range (0.1 mu
   M-0.5 mM), outstanding detection limit (30 nM), attractive selectivity,
   good reproducibility, high stability as well as prominent feasibility

AB Routine native immobilized pH gradient isoelectric focusing (IPG-IEF)
   and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) are still suffering from
   unfortunate reproducibility, poor resolution (caused by protein
   precipitation) and instability in characterization of intact protein
   isoforms and posttranslational modifications. Based on the concept of
   moving reaction boundary (MRB), we firstly proposed a tunable
   non-IPG-IEF system to address these issues. By choosing proper pairs of
   catholyte and anolyte, we could achieve desired cathodic and anodic
   migrating pH gradients in non-IPG-IEF system, effectively eliminating
   protein precipitation and uncertainty of quantitation existing in
   routine IEF and 2DE, and enhancing the resolution and sensitivity of
   IEF. Then, an adjustable 2DE system was developed by combining
   non-IPG-IEF with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The improved
   2DE was evaluated by testing model proteins and colon cancer cell
   lysates. The experiments revealed that (i) a tunable pH gradient could
   be designed via MRB; (ii) up to 1.65 fold improvement of resolution was
   achieved via non-IPG-IEF; (iii) the sensitivity of developed techniques
   was increased up to 2.7 folds; and (iv) up to about 16.4% more protein
   spots could be observed via the adjustable 2DE as compared with routine
   one. The developed techniques might contribute to complex proteome
   research, especially for screening of biological marker and analysis of
   extreme acidic/alkaline proteins. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Metal organic coordination polymers (CPs), as most attractive

   However, metal-biomolecule CPs and CPs' electrochemical properties and
   applications were studied much less. We focus on this topic aiming at
   electrochemical biosensors with excellent performance and high
   biocompatibility. A new nanoscaled metal-biomolecule CP, Mn-tyr,
   containing manganese and tyrosine, was synthesized hydrothermally and
   characterized by various techniques, including XRD, TEM, EDS, EDX
   mapping, elemental analysis, XPS, and IR. Electrode modified with Mn-tyr
   showed novel bidirectional electrocatalytic ability toward both
   reduction and oxidation of H2O2, which might be due to Mn. With the
   assistance of CNTs, the sensing performance of Mn-tyr/CNTs/GCE was
   improved to a much higher level, with high sensitivity of 543 mA mol(-1)
   L cm(-2) in linear range of 1.00 x 10(-6)-1.02 x 10(-4) mol L-1, and
   detection limit of 3.8 x 10(-7) mol L. Mn-tyr/CNTs/GCE also showed fast
   response, high selectivity, high steadiness and reproducibility. The
   excellent performance implies that the metal-biomolecule CPs are
   promising candidates for using in enzyme-free electrochemical

   bimodal silica-organic sal-gel matrix comprised of tetraethoxysilane
   (TEOS), the hydrophobic additive methyltriethoxysilane (MTES) and the
   porogen polyethylene glycol (PEG). Under carefully optimized
   experimental conditions, employing basic catalysts, yeast cells have
   become the nucleation centers for a silica-organic capsule assembled
   around the cells. The dynamic process involved in the formation of the
   sal-gel matrix has been investigated using optical and scanning electron
   microscopic techniques. The results demonstrated the influence of the
   MTES composition on the nature of the encapsulation of the yeast cells,
   together with the architecture of the three-dimensional (3D) sol-gel
   biomatrix that forms during the encapsulation process. A silica capsule
   was found to form around each yeast cell when using 85 vol% MTES. This
   capsule was found to protect the microorganisms from the harmful effects
   that result from exposure to heavy metal ions and UV radiation. The

AB Early cancer diagnosis is critical for the prevention of metastasis.
   However, simple and efficient methods are needed to improve the
   diagnosis and evaluation of cancer. Here, we propose a reusable
   biosensor based on a magnetic graphene oxide (MGO)-modified Au electrode
   to detect vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in human plasma for
   cancer diagnosis. In this biosensor, Avastin is used as the specific
   biorecognition element, and MGO is used as the carrier for Avastin
   loading. The use of MGO enables rapid purification due to its magnetic
   properties, which prevents the loss of bioactivity. Moreover, the
   biosensor can be constructed quickly, without requiring a drying
   process, which is convenient for proceeding to detection. Our reusable
   biosensor provides the appropriate sensitivity for clinical diagnostics
   and has a wide range of linear detection, from 31.25-2000 pg mL(-1),
   compared to ELISA analysis. In addition, in experiments with 100% serum
   from clinical samples, readouts from the sensor and an ELISA for VEGF
   showed good correlation within the limits of the ELISA kit. The relative
   standard deviation (RSD) of the change in current (Delta C) for
   reproducibility of the Au biosensor was 2.36% (n=50), indicating that it
   can be reused with high reproducibility. Furthermore, the advantages of
   the Avastin-MGO-modified biosensor for VEGF detection are that it
   provides an efficient detection strategy that not only improves the
   detection ability but also reduces the cost and decreases the response
   time by 10-fold, indicating its potential as a diagnosis product. (C)

AB We propose a new, paper-based analytical device (PAD) for blood typing
   that allows for the simultaneous determination of ABO and Rh blood
   groups on the same device. The device was successfully fabricated by
   using a combination of wax printing and wax dipping methods. A 1:2 blood
   dilution was used for forward grouping, whereas whole blood could be
   used for reverse grouping. A 30% cell suspension of A-cells or B-cells
   was used for haemagglutination on the reverse grouping side. The total
   assay time was 10 min. The ratio between the distance of red blood cell
   movement and plasma separation is the criterion for agglutination and
   indicates the presence of the corresponding antigen or antibody. The
   proposed PAD has excellent reproducibility in that the same blood
   groups, namely A, AB, and 0, were reported by using different PADs that
   were fabricated on the same day (n=10). The accuracy for detecting blood
   group A (n=12), B (n=13), AB (n=9), 0 (n=14), and Rh (n=48) typing were
   92%, 85%, 89%, 93%, and 96%, respectively, in comparison with the
   conventional slide test method. The haematocrit of the sample affects
   the accuracy of the results, and appropriate dilution is suggested
   before typing. In conclusion, this study proposes a novel method that is
   straightforward, time-saving, and inexpensive for the simultaneous
   determination of ABO and Rh blood groups, which is promising for use in
   developing countries. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   for the selective determination of the Hg2+ ion by the use of different
   electrodes modified with polythymine, bearing methylene blue, as redox
   probe, in 3' position. The determination of Hg2+ can be employed with an
   excellent degree of selectivity by the use of DNA biosensors through the
   formation of the complex Thymine-Hg-Thymine (T-Hg-T): in fact, Hg2+
   tends to bind two thymines, generating a T-Hg-T complex with a formation
   constant higher than that one of the coupling Adenine-Thymine, which can
   be employed for a selective, fast and cost-effective Hg2+ detection.
   The presence of the Hg2+ in solution leads to the formation of T-Hg-T
   complex thus causing the "hairpin-like" folding of oligonucleotide,
   leading to an improved electronic exchange of methylene blue with the
   electrode surface due to the reduced distance and thus to an increase of
   the faradic current which is detected by means of square wave
   voltammetry (SWV). To test the feasibility of this kind of biosensor to
   be applied to the analysis of Hg2+ we have developed several biosensors
   configuration by modifying the electrochemical sensor transducer: (a) Au
   electrode; (b) Au screen-printed electrode (SPE). The proposed system,
   allows the determination of Hg2+ in the range 0.2-100 nM (0.05-20 ppb),
   with a sensitivity 0.327 mu A/nM, LOD 0.1 nM (0.02 ppb), LOQ 0.2 nM
   (0.05 ppb) and RSD <= 4.3% when Au electrode is used as electrochemical
   transducer; on the other hand, in the case of Au SPE the linear range is
   0.2-50 nM (0.05-10 ppb), with a sensitivity 0.285 mu A/nM, while LOD and
   LOQ are the same as previously and RSD is <= 3.8%. This enabled the
   detection of mercury in real samples (waters and fishes) with good
   accuracy (recoveries 92-101% on waters and 92-107% on fishes,
   respectively) and reproducibility (RSD <= 9.6% for measurements on
   waters and <= 8.8% on fishes, respectively). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

AB This work presents the development of an ultrasensitive biosensor for
   detection of streptomycin residues in milk samples using flow injection
   analysis-electrochemical quartz crystal nanobalance (FIA-EQCN)
   technique. Monoclonal antibody specific to streptomycin was immobilized
   on to the thiol modified gold quartz crystal surface. A broad dynamic
   range (0.3-300 ng/mL) was obtained for streptomycin with a good
   linearity in the range 0.3-10 ng/mL for PBS and 03-50 ng/mL for milk.
   The correlation coefficient (R-2) of the biosensor was found to be 0.994
   and 0.997 for PBS and milk respectively. Excellent recoveries were
   obtained from the streptomycin spiked milk samples in the range
   98-9933%, which shows the applicability of the developed biosensor in
   milk. The reproducibility of the developed biosensor was found
   satisfactory with % RSD (n=5) 0.351. A good co-relation was observed
   between the streptomycin recoveries measured through the developed
   biosensor and the commercial ELISA kit. The analytical figures of merit
   of the developed biosensor confirm that the developed FIA-EQCN biosensor
   could be very effective for low-level detection of streptomycin in milk
   samples. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We have developed a rapid, sensitive, and specific droplet-based
   immunoassay for the detection of Escherichia coil and Salmonella within
   a single-pipetted sample. Polycaprolactone (PCL) electrospun fibers on
   indium-tin-oxide (ITO) glass provide a sufficient surface to render a
   non-slip droplet condition, and while the PCL fibers lend a local
   hydrophilicity (contact angle theta=74 degrees) for sufficient
   sub-micron particle adhesion, air pockets within the fibers lend an
   apparent hydrophobicity. Overall, the contact angle of water on this
   electrospun surface is 119 degrees, and the air pockets cause the
   droplet to be completely immobile and resistant to movement, protecting
   it from external vibration. By using both anti-E. coil conjugated, 510
   nm diameter green fluorescent particles (480 nm excitation and 520 nm
   emission) and anti-Salmonella conjugated, 400 nm diameter red
   fluorescent particles (640 nm excitation and 690 nm emission), we can
   detect multiple targets in a single droplet. Using appropriate light
   sources guided by fiber optics, we determined a detection limit of 10(2)
   CPU mL(-1). Immunoagglutination can be observed under a fluorescence
   microscope. Fluorescence detection (at the emission wavelength) of
   immunoagglutination was maximum at 90 degrees from the incident light,
   while light scattering (at the excitation wavelength) was still present
   and behaved similarly, indicating the ability of double detection,
   greatly improving credibility and reproducibility of the assay. A power
   function (light intensity) simulation of elastic Mie scatter confirmed
   that both fluorescence and light scattering were present. Due to the
   site of the fluorescent particles relative to their incident excitation
   wavelengths, Mie scatter conditions were observed, and fluorescence
   signals show a similar trend to light scattering signals. Smartphone
   detection was included for true portable detection, in which the high
   contact angle pinning of the droplet makes this format re-usable and
   re-configurable. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   in flow mode is achieved using a hybrid polydimethylsiloxane/polyester

   Both systems are very sensitive with low limit of detection (LOD): 0.006
   mu M and 0.004 mu M for batch and flow modes, respectively.
   Nevertheless, the flow mode has advantages such as its reusability,
   automation, low sample volume (6 mu L), and fast response (20 s).

AB A reusable robust radio frequency (RF) biosensor with a rectangular
   meandered line (RML) resonator on a gallium arsenide substrate by
   integrated passive device (IPD) technology was designed, fabricated and
   tested to enable the real-time identification of the glucose level in
   human serum. The air-bridge structure fabricated by an IPD technology
   was applied to the RML resonator to improve its sensitivity by
   increasing the magnitude of the return loss (S-21). The resonance
   behaviour, based on S-21 characteristics of the biosensor, was analysed
   at 9.20 GHz with human serum containing different glucose concentration
   ranging from 148-268 mg dl(-1), 105-225 mg dl(-1) and at a deionised (D)
   water glucose concentration in the range of 25 - 500 mg dl(-1) for seven
   different samples. A calibration analysis was performed for the human
   serum from two different subjects and for D-glucose at a response time
   of 60 s; the reproducibility, the minimum shift in resonance frequency
   and the long-term stability of the signal were investigated. The feature
   characteristics based on the resonance concept after the use of serum as
   an analyte are modelled as an inductor, capacitor and resistor. The
   findings support the development of resonance-based sensing with art
   excellent sensitivity of 1.08 MHz per 1 mg dl(-1), a detection limit of
   8.01 mg dl(-1), and a limit of quantisation of 24.30 mg dl(-1). (C) 2014

AB As awareness of traumatic brain injury (TBI) increases, the need to
   detect mild forms and distinguish between the different severities of
   TBI becomes more apparent. The goal of this work is to develop a
   point-of-care sensor to detect whole blood biomarkers for rapid and
   sensitive diagnosis of TBI severity. Presented herein is the enzymatic
   detection of norepinephrine through the use of immobilization chemistry
   and impedance techniques. Sustained elevation of norepinephrine
   concentrations in the blood has been correlated to negative long-term
   outcomes in TBI cases, often resulting in permanent cognitive or
   physical deficits.
   Novel analysis techniques have been used to identify an optimal binding
   frequency (371.1 Hz) of norepinephrine to the immobilized enzyme on a
   gold disk electrode. This form of analysis yielded a logarithmic fit
   characterized by exceptional responsivity (20.89 Omega/pgmL(-1)),
   reproducibility (R-2=0.96), and lower limit of detection (98 pg/mL)
   first in purified samples, then in rabbit whole blood solutions. Once
   the optimal binding frequency was determined, the preliminary use of an
   impedance-time technique was attempted in this work. This technique more
   closely resembles the amperometric detection method used in commercial
   self-monitoring blood glucose meters, allowing for continuous or
   instantaneous measurement of blood borne biomarkers without compromising
   sensitivity. Future directions include exploration of simultaneous
   multi-marker detection with the impedance-time technique and
   experimentation with novel mesoporous materials to filter large blood
   components. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB We investigate the environmental stability of fullerene solutions by
   static and dynamic light scattering, FTIR, NMR and mass spectroscopies,
   and quantum chemical calculations. We find that visible light exposure
   of fullerene solutions in toluene, a good solvent, under ambient
   laboratory conditions results in C60 oxidation to form fullerene
   epoxides, and subsequently causes fullerene clustering in solution. The
   clusters grow with time, even in absence of further illumination, and
   can reach dimensions from 100nm to the mum scale over 1day. Static light
   scattering suggests that resulting aggregates are fractal, with a
   characteristic power law (df) that increases from approximately 1.3 to
   2.0 during light exposure. The clusters are bound by weak Coulombic
   interactions and are found to be reversible, disintegrating by
   mechanical agitation and thermal stress, and reforming over time. Our
   findings are relevant to the solution processing of composites and
   organic photovoltaics, whose reproducibility and performance requires
   control of fullerene solution stability under storage conditions.

AB Early cancer diagnosis is critical for the prevention of metastasis.
   However, simple and efficient methods are needed to improve the
   diagnosis and evaluation of cancer. Here, we propose a reusable
   biosensor based on a magnetic graphene oxide (MGO)-modified Au electrode
   to detect vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in human plasma for
   cancer diagnosis. In this biosensor, Avastin is used as the specific
   biorecognition element, and MGO is used as the carrier for Avastin
   loading. The use of MGO enables rapid purification due to its magnetic
   properties, which prevents the loss of bioactivity. Moreover, the
   biosensor can be constructed quickly, without requiring a drying
   process, which is convenient for proceeding to detection. Our reusable
   biosensor provides the appropriate sensitivity for clinical diagnostics
   and has a wide range of linear detection, from 31.25-2000 pg mL -1,
   compared to ELISA analysis. In addition, in experiments with 100% serum
   from clinical samples, readouts from the sensor and an ELISA for VEGF
   showed good correlation within the limits of the ELISA kit. The relative
   standard deviation (RSD) of the change in current (Delta C) for
   reproducibility of the Au biosensor was 2.36% ( n=50), indicating that
   it can be reused with high reproducibility. Furthermore, the advantages
   of the Avastin-MGO-modified biosensor for VEGF detection are that it
   provides an efficient detection strategy that not only improves the
   detection ability but also reduces the cost and decreases the response
   time by 10-fold, indicating its potential as a diagnosis product. [All

AB Metal organic coordination polymers (CPs), as most attractive

   However, metal-biomolecule CPs and CPs' electrochemical properties and
   applications were studied much less. We focus on this topic aiming at
   electrochemical biosensors with excellent performance and high
   biocompatibility. A new nanoscaled metal-biomolecule CP, Mn-tyr,
   containing manganese and tyrosine, was synthesized hydrothermally and
   characterized by various techniques, including XRD, TEM, EDS, EDX
   mapping, elemental analysis, XPS, and IR. Electrode modified with Mn-tyr
   showed novel bidirectional electrocatalytic ability toward both
   reduction and oxidation of H 2O 2, which might be due to Mn. With the
   assistance of CNTs, the sensing performance of Mn-tyr/CNTs/GCE was
   improved to a much higher level, with high sensitivity of 543 mA mol -1
   L cm -2 in linear range of 1.00times10 -6-1.02times10 -4 mol L -1, and
   detection limit of 3.8times10 -7 mol L -1. Mn-tyr/CNTs/GCE also showed
   fast response, high selectivity, high steadiness and reproducibility.
   The excellent performance implies that the metal-biomolecule CPs are
   promising candidates for using in enzyme-free electrochemical
   biosensing. [All rights reserved Elsevier].

   and make critical assessment of feasibility of low-temperature XAFS
   experiments in terms of data quality and reproducibility, temperature
   range, calibration and attainable resolution. We adopted the Debye
   Model-based calibration method by measuring XAFS of standard Au Foil
   with known Debye temperature (Theta(Debye))(Au)(thory) = 165 K. The data
   is of good quality and reproducible with international data. By fitting
   Debye Waller Factor (sigma(2)(expt)(T))), we deduced
   (Theta(Debye))(Au)(expt)= 163 K which implies calibration within 2 K.
   Error bars for sigma(2)(expt) (T) correspond to temperature uncertainty
   Delta T < 5 K, which defines the temperature resolution for low
   temperature XAFS experiments. Thus, from both calibration and resolution
   points-of-view, this work demonstrates the feasibility of low
   temperature XAFS experiments at BL-09, Indus-2. Feasibility of extending
   XAFS experiments to lower temperature and unknown samples is discussed.

AB Propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol) is commonly used as an anaesthetic
   agent but is also abused for recreational purposes. Several cases of
   fatalities involving self-administered propofol have been reported. For
   rapid quantification of propofol and propofol beta-d-glucuronide
   (propofol G) in clinical and forensic cases, an ultra-performance liquid
   chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method using pneumatically
   assisted electrospray ionisation has been developed. The technique has
   been validated on both ante-mortem and post-mortem human whole blood.
   The proteins in the blood samples were removed by the addition of a
   mixture of methanol and acetonitrile, and the extract was cleaned up by
   solid phase extraction. The extract was concentrated in dimethyl
   sulphoxide. The system was calibrated using matrix-matched calibrants
   combined with isotope dilution. The lower limits of quantification were
   0.01 and 0.02mg/L for propofol and 0.02 and 0.04mg/L for propofol G in
   ante-mortem and post-mortem whole blood, respectively. The relative
   intra-laboratory reproducibility standard deviation was less than 10% at
   concentrations of 0.2mg/L or higher. The mean true extraction recovery
   was 85% for propofol and 81% for propofol G. The trueness of the
   propofol determination expressed as the relative bias of the test
   results was within ±6% at concentration levels of 0.01-8.5mg/L. Propofol
   was less stable in blood stabilised with a citrate-EDTA-fluoride mixture
   than in blood stabilised with an oxalate-fluoride mixture. The stability
   was lower at -20°C than at 5°C and -80°C. Propofol G did not show
   instability under the storage conditions tested.

AB This article pertains to development and validation of a low cost, fast,
   sensitive, and accurate RP-HPLC method for quantitative analysis of HZ.
   A Hibar mu Bondapak C-18 column as the stationary phase and
   acetonitrile:methanol:buffer (500:200:300) as the mobile phase were used
   to accomplish the separation, when drawn at a flow rate of 1.0mL/min,
   with 235nm as monitoring wavelength. Linearity was established by
   studying the drug over the concentration range of 10-10000ngmL(-1),
   correlation coefficient of r=0.9993, drug recovery (97 to 102%), and
   high reproducibility in serum samples (less than 2.5% RSD) displayed
   excellent linearity, accuracy, and precision. Force degradation studies
   of the drug under various stress conditions (acid, base, oxidation,
   photo, and thermal) proved the stability indicating power of the method.
   Substantial method validation study was carried out inline with ICH
   guidelines and was applied successfully to quantify the amount of HZ in
   bulk, pharmaceutical formulations, and blood serum samples.

AB A 120-mm wide amorphous ribbon of a Fe-Co-Si-B-P-Cu NANOMET reg alloy
   has been successfully produced by a single roll melt spinning technique.
   The optimally annealed samples exhibited low coercivity ( Hc) of 5-7 A/m
   and high saturation magnetic flux density ( Bs) of 1.83 T. The plots of 
   Hc and  Bs vs. annealing temperature ( Ta) revealed basin-like and
   plateau-like characteristics, respectively, indicating the good
   annealing controllability for nanocrystallization and for obtaining
   soft-magnetic properties with high  Bs. The excellent magnetic softness
   was attributed to the nanocrystalline structure composed of
   homogeneously dispersed alpha-Fe grains (with a size of 15-20 nm in
   diameter) emerged from the amorphous structure after optimum annealing.
   The nanocrystalline ribbons also exhibited low core-losses ( W at 50 Hz)
   of 0.37 and 0.64 W/kg under maximum flux density of 1.5 T and 1.7 T,
   respectively. The magnetic properties were comparable with those of
   laboratory-scale small-width ribbons and confirmed to be independent on
   the ribbon width, indicating the good reproducibility of this NANOMET
   reg alloy into mass-production-level precursors.

AB Mouse local lymph node assay (LLNA, OECD TG429) is an alternative test
   replacing conventional guinea pig tests (OECD TG406) for the skin
   sensitization test but the use of a radioisotopic agent, (3)H-thymidine,
   deters its active dissemination. New non-radioisotopic LLNA,
   LLNA:BrdU-FCM employs a non-radioisotopic analog,
   5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) and flow cytometry. For an analogous
   method, OECD TG429 performance standard (PS) advises that two reference
   compounds be tested repeatedly and ECt(threshold) values obtained must
   fall within acceptable ranges to prove within- and between-laboratory
   reproducibility. However, this criteria is somewhat arbitrary and sample
   size of ECt is less than 5, raising concerns about insufficient
   reliability. Here, we explored various statistical methods to evaluate
   the reproducibility of LLNA:BrdU-FCM with stimulation index (SI), the
   raw data for ECt calculation, produced from 3 laboratories. Descriptive
   statistics along with graphical representation of SI was presented. For
   inferential statistics, parametric and non-parametric methods were
   applied to test the reproducibility of SI of a concurrent positive
   control and the robustness of results were investigated. Descriptive
   statistics and graphical representation of SI alone could illustrate the
   within- and between-laboratory reproducibility. Inferential statistics
   employing parametric and nonparametric methods drew similar conclusion.
   While all labs passed within- and between-laboratory reproducibility
   criteria given by OECD TG429 PS based on ECt values, statistical
   evaluation based on SI values showed that only two labs succeeded in
   achieving within-laboratory reproducibility. For those two labs that
   satisfied the within-lab reproducibility, between-laboratory
   reproducibility could be also attained based on inferential as well as
   descriptive statistics.

AB The purpose of this study is to develop a typology of gay male consumers
   based on self-concept variables related to social interactions. Openness
   about sexual orientation, collective self-esteem, stigma-consciousness,
   and negative evaluation were used to identify clusters of gay male
   consumers. An initial test sample (n = 125) suggested a three-cluster
   solution, and a validation sample (n = 247) established reproducibility
   of the proposed typology. Three clusters with distinct interaction
   styles emerged: "confident gay," "diffident gay," and "guarded gay."
   Additionally, the usefulness of the typology is demonstrated by
   comparing the clusters on the basis of complaining propensity.
   Typologies of each cluster and implications for research and practice
   are discussed.

AB Torulaspora delbrueckii yeast strains are being increasingly applied at
   the industrial level, such as in the winemaking process, and so their
   identification and characterisation require effective, fast, accurate,
   reproducible and reliable approaches. Therefore, the development of
   typing techniques that allow discrimination at the strain level will
   provide an essential tool for those working with T. delbrueckii strains.
   Here, 28 T. delbrueckii strains from various substrates were
   characterised using different PCR-fingerprinting molecular methods:
   random amplified polymorphic DNA with polymerase chain reaction
   (RAPD-PCR), minisatellites SED1, AGA1, DAN4 and the newly designed T.
   delbrueckii (Td)PIR, and microsatellites (GAC)5 and (GTG)5. The aim was
   to determine and compare the efficacies, reproducibilities and
   discriminating powers of these molecular methods. RAPD-PCR using the M13
   primers and the newly designed TdPIR3 minisatellite primer pair provided
   discrimination of the greatest number of T. delbrueckii strains. TdPIR3
   clustered the 28 strains into 16 different groups with an efficiency of
   100%, while M13 clustered the strains into 17 different groups, although
   with a lower efficiency of 89%. Moreover, the TdPIR3 primers showed
   reproducible profiles when the stringency of the PCR protocol was
   varied, which highlighted the great robustness of this technique. In
   contrast, variation of the stringency of the M13 PCR protocol resulted
   in modification of the amplified profiles, which suggested low
   reproducibility of this technique.

   using the fluorescence polarisation immunoassay (FPIA). Three tracers
   with different lengths of bridge (0-, 2- and 6-carbon bridge) between
   the hapten molecule
   4-[[(2,3-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-7-benzofuranyloxy)carbonyl]-amino]-butanoi
   c acid (BFNB) and 5-aminofluorescein (AF), fluoresceinthiocarbamyl
   ethylenediamine (EDF), fluoresceinthiocarbamyl hexylenediamine (HDF),
   were synthesised and their binding response with
   anti-carbofuran-specific antibody were evaluated. The physicochemical
   parameters were optimised for the FPIA. The AF-labelled BFNB conjugate
   (BFNB-AF) was found to be the optimal tracer for FPIA of carbofuran. The
   detection limit of carbofuran, IC50 value and the working range were
   2.3, 48.8 and 7.4-202.2 mu g/L, respectively; and the reaction time was
   only 10 min. The average recovery from spiked water and vegetable
   samples was 86.9-95.4% and the mean coefficient of variation was 6.2%
   for inter-assay and 8.7% for intra-assay, which showed good
   reproducibility for FPIA. Thus, the developed FPIA method exhibited the
   potential for the rapid and accurate determination of carbofuran in
   agricultural and environmental samples.

AB BACKGROUND: The RENAL nephrometry score (RNS) allows description of the
   anatomy and the complexity of renal masses. This study aimed to
   investigate the interobserver reproducibility of the RNS between a
   radiologist and a urologist.
   METHODS: The computed tomography (CT) scans of patients undergoing
   partial nephrectomy in the authors' department between June 2010 and
   June 2013 were analyzed for determination of the RNS by a urologist and
   a radiologist blinded to the medical records. Cohen's kappa coefficient
   was used for interobserver reproducibility assessment. Correlations with
   per- and postoperative complication rates and renal function were
   assessed.
   RESULTS: The study included 52 consecutive patients with a mean age of
   55years. The average score was 7.4±1.7 for the urologist and 7.3±1.5 for
   the radiologist. The Cohen's kappa was 0.81 for R, 0.47 for E, 0.63 for
   N, 0.28 for A, and 0.21 for L. The Pearson's coefficient for the total
   RNS was 0.70. The operative time and the occurrence of major
   complications were significantly correlated with the complexity assessed
   by the score of both observers. In the univariate analysis, the RNS, the
   American Society of Anesthesiologists score, and the patient's age were
   significantly associated with major complication rates. In the
   multivariate analysis, the RNS remained significantly associated with
   major complications. No significant difference in postoperative renal
   function according to complexity group was found by either the urologist
   or the radiologist.
   CONCLUSIONS: The reproducibility of the RNS between the radiologist
   andthe urologist was not very good, especially for some items referring
   to the location of the tumor, although the major complication rates were
   significantly associated with the RNS for both observers.

AB Performance characteristics of the megavoltage photon dose measurements
   with EPR and table sugar were analyzed. An advantage of sugar as a
   dosimetric material is its tissue equivalency. The minimal detectable
   dose was found to be 1.5Gy for both the 6 and 18MV photons. The dose
   response curves are linear up to at least 20Gy. The energy dependence of
   the dose response in the megavoltage energy range is very weak and
   probably statistically insignificant. Reproducibility of measurements of
   various doses in this range performed with the peak-to-peak and
   double-integral methods is reported. The method can be used in real-time
   dosimetry in radiation therapy.

AB Color pencils are widely used mostly in kindergartens, in schools and
   could be found in all houses with families having young children. Their
   wide spread use in modern times as well as their chemical composition,
   consisting mostly of Si and Al, constitute two strong motivations
   towards exploiting their use as accidental retrospective
   thermoluminescent dosimeters. The present manuscript reports on the
   study of colored pencils manufactured by a commercial brand in China
   which is very common throughout Turkey. The preliminary results
   discussed in the present work illustrated encouraging characteristics,
   such as the presence of a trapping level giving rise to natural TL in a
   temperature range that is sufficiently high. Specific thermoluminescence
   features of this peak, such as glow peak shape and analysis, anomalous
   fading, thermal quenching, reproducibility, linearity and recovery
   ability to low attributed doses were studied. The results suggest that
   the color pencils could be effectively used in the framework of
   retrospective thermoluminescent dosimetry with extreme caution, based on
   multiple aliquot protocols.

AB Indigenous species are less commonly used in laboratory aquatic toxicity
   tests compared with standard test species due to (1) limited
   availability lack of requisite information necessary for their
   acclimation and maintenance under laboratory conditions and (2) lack of
   information on their sensitivity and the reproducibility of toxicity
   test results. As part of the Natural Resource Damage Assessment aquatic
   toxicity program in response to the Deepwater Horizon Oil incident
   (2010), sensitive life stages of native Gulf of Mexico species were
   evaluated in laboratory toxicity tests to determine the potential
   effects of the spill. Fish (n=5) and invertebrates (n=2) selected for
   this program include the following: the Florida pompano (Trachinotus
   carolinus), red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), spotted sea trout (Cynoscion
   nebulosus), cobia (Rachycentron canadum), red porgy (Pagrus pagrus),
   blue crab (Callinectes sapidus), and the common moon jellyfish (Aurelia
   aurita). Initially in the program, to establish part of the background
   information, acute tests with reference toxicants (CdCl2, KCl, CuSO4)
   were performed with each species to establish data on intraspecies
   variability and test precision as well as identify other factors that
   may affect toxicity results. Median lethal concentration (LC50) values
   were calculated for each acute toxicity test with average LC50 values
   ranging from 248 to 862mg/L for fish exposures to potassium chloride.
   Variability between test results was determined for each species by
   calculating the coefficient of variation (%CV) based on LC50 values. CVs
   ranged from 11.2% for pompano (96-h LC50 value) to 74.8% for red porgy
   24-h tests. Cadmium chloride acute toxicity tests with the jellyfish A.
   aurita had the lowest overall CV of 3.6%. By understanding acute
   toxicity to these native organisms from a compound with known toxicity
   ranges and the variability in test results, acute tests with nonstandard
   species can be better interpreted and used appropriately when
   determining risk.

AB PURPOSE: To evaluate the reproducibility of anterior chamber angle
   measurements obtained by the Zeiss Visante anterior segment optical
   coherence tomography (AS-OCT).
   METHODS: Twenty eyes from 20 normal subjects with open anterior chamber
   angles were studied. The anterior chamber angle was imaged using the
   Visante AS-OCT. The angle-opening distance (AOD 500, AOD 750),
   trabercular iris space area (TISA 500, TISA 750) and scleral spur angle
   (SS angle) at the inferior angle location were measured. All the
   subjects underwent imaging in a darkened room (1foot candles measured at
   the eye). Images were graded in a masked fashion by certified Doheny
   Image Reading Center graders. For intra-grader reproducibility
   assessments, images were re-graded by the same grader 1 week later after
   random sorting of images. For inter-grader assessments, a second masked
   grader independently reviewed the images. Intraclass correlation
   coefficients (ICC) were used to assess reproducibility.
   RESULTS: Inferior angle measurements of AOD (500, 750), TISA (500, 750)
   and SS angle for 20 normal eyes were calculated. The intra-observer ICC
   calculations showed excellent reproducibility for all measurements (AOD
   500=0.95, AOD 750=0.97, TISA 500=0.93, TISA 750=0.94, SS=0.96; p<0.001
   for all). The inter-observer ICC calculations showed lower
   reproducibility for all measurements (AOD 500=0.71, p<0.001; AOD
   750=0.82, p<0.001; TISA 500=0.49, p=0.08; TISA 750=0.61, p=0.02;
   SS=0.75).
   CONCLUSION: Determination of anterior chamber angle measurements was
   possible with the time-domain AS-OCT, but only modest inter-observer
   reproducibility was found even among experienced graders.

AB OBJECTIVES: We sought to assess the feasibility and reproducibility of
   3-dimensional ultrasound molecular imaging (USMI) of vascular
   endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) expression in tumor
   angiogenesis using a clinical matrix array transducer and a clinical
   grade VEGFR2-targeted contrast agent in a murine model of human colon
   cancer.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Animal studies were approved by the Institutional
   Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care. Mice with human colon
   cancer xenografts (n = 33) were imaged with a clinical ultrasound system
   and transducer (Philips iU22; X6-1) after intravenous injection of
   either clinical grade VEGFR2-targeted microbubbles or nontargeted
   control microbubbles. Nineteen mice were scanned twice to assess imaging
   reproducibility. Fourteen mice were scanned both before and 24 hours
   after treatment with either bevacizumab (n = 7) or saline only (n = 7).
   Three-dimensional USMI data sets were retrospectively reconstructed into
   multiple consecutive 1-mm-thick USMI data sets to simulate 2-dimensional
   imaging. Vascular VEGFR2 expression was assessed ex vivo using
   immunofluorescence.
   RESULTS: Three-dimensional USMI was highly reproducible using both
   VEGFR2-targeted microbubbles and nontargeted control microbubbles
   (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.83). The VEGFR2-targeted USMI
   signal significantly (P = 0.02) decreased by 57% after antiangiogenic
   treatment compared with the control group, which correlated well with ex
   vivo VEGFR2 expression on immunofluorescence (rho = 0.93, P = 0.003). If
   only central 1-mm tumor planes were analyzed to assess antiangiogenic
   treatment response, the USMI signal change was significantly (P = 0.006)
   overestimated by an average of 27% (range, 2%-73%) compared with
   3-dimensional USMI.
   CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional USMI is feasible and highly reproducible
   and allows accurate assessment and monitoring of VEGFR2 expression in
   tumor angiogenesis in a murine model of human colon cancer.

AB Lipase is the key enzyme for catalyzing triglyceride hydrolysis in vivo,
   and lipase inhibitors have been used in the management of obesity. We
   present the first report on the use of lipase-adsorbed halloysite
   nanotubes as an efficient medium for the selective enrichment of lipase
   inhibitors from natural products. A simple and rapid approach was
   proposed to fabricate lipase-adsorbed nanotubes through electrostatic
   interaction. Results showed that more than 85% lipase was adsorbed into
   nanotubes in 90min, and approximately 80% of the catalytic activity was
   maintained compared with free lipase. The specificity and
   reproducibility of the proposed approach were validated by screening a
   known lipase inhibitor (i.e., orlistat) from a mixture that contains
   active and inactive compounds. Moreover, we applied this approach with
   high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry technique to
   screen lipase inhibitors from the Magnoliae cortex extract, a medicinal
   plant used for treating obesity. Two novel biphenyl-type natural lipase
   inhibitors magnotriol A and magnaldehyde B were identified, and their
   IC50 values were determined as 213.03 and 96.96muM, respectively. The
   ligand-enzyme interactions of magnaldehyde B were further investigated
   by molecular docking. Our findings proved that enzyme-adsorbed nanotube
   could be used as a feasible and selective affinity medium for the rapid
   screening of enzyme inhibitors from complex mixtures.

AB This paper evaluates different multiresidue methods based on
   comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to
   time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC*GC-TOF/MS) to analyze
   dioxin-related micropollutants in complex food matrices. In a first
   step, the column sets Rtx-PCB/BPX-50 and Rtx-Dioxin2/BPX-50 were
   compared in terms of peak shape (width and symmetry) and resolution for
   the separation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated
   dibenzo-p-dioxins/dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) in solvent. A satisfactory
   separation of 206 dioxin-related micropollutants including the 17 toxic
   PCDD/Fs was achieved in 75min with the column set Rtx-Dioxin2/BPX-50. In
   a second time, the GC*GC-TOF/MS method was spread to the analysis of
   dioxin-related micropollutants in complex food matrices. An extraction
   procedure including accelerated solvent extraction (ASE), centrifugal
   evaporation and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was optimized.
   Starting with meat as a model matrix, a micropollutant spiking method
   was then set up by comparing seven methods in terms of recoveries and
   reproducibility. The method combining immersion of the meat in a large
   volume of solvent containing micropollutants followed by homogenization
   by blender induced recoveries in the acceptable range of 70-130% and
   satisfactory standard deviations (≤10%) for most of the compounds
   studied. Limits of detection of the GC*GC-TOF/MS method ranged between
   50 and 100pg/g of spiked fresh meat for PCBs and between 65 and 227pg/g
   for PCDD/Fs. Potential applications of this method are discussed.

   samples by on-line combination of capillary isotachophoresis-capillary
   zone electrophoresis (cITP-CZE) in automated electrophoretic analyzer
   with the column-coupling configuration of the separation unit were
   studied in this work. The main focus was devoted on the reproducibility
   of important analytes' parameters (migration time, peak height and peak
   area) and also on the stability studies of selected low and high
   molecular mass analytes of inorganic/organic origins (bromate, vitamins,
   proteins) present at low concentration levels in different kinds of
   matrices (mineral water, human urine). Such study was carried out for
   the first time for the electrophoretic analyzer operating in the
   hydrodynamically closed separation system provided with contact-less
   conductivity detectors and UV detector in CZE step. Hydrodynamic and
   electroosmotic flows of the buffer solutions were suppressed and
   therefore, only the electrophoretic transport of ions was significant.
   Obtained results showed the different stabilities of the analytes and
   samples depending on their origin. The focus in the long-term analyses
   should be paid on the storage of the samples and on the regular changing
   the contents of electrolyte vessels to keep the electrolyte composition
   and separation conditions as constant as possible.

AB Culture-independent studies rely on the quantity and quality of the
   extracted environmental metagenomic DNA (mDNA). To fully access the
   plant tissue microbiome, the extracted plant mDNA should allow optimal
   PCR applications and the genetic content must be representative of the
   total microbial diversity. In this study, we evaluated the endophytic
   bacterial diversity retrieved using different mDNA extraction
   procedures. Metagenomic DNA from sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench)
   stem and root tissues were extracted using two classical DNA extraction
   protocols (CTAB- and SDS-based) and five commercial kits. The mDNA
   yields and quality as well as the reproducibility were compared. 16S
   rRNA gene terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-RFLP) was
   used to assess the impact on endophytic bacterial community structures
   observed. Generally, the classical protocols obtained high mDNA yields
   from sorghum tissues; however, they were less reproducible than the
   commercial kits. Commercial kits retrieved higher quality mDNA, but with
   lower endophytic bacterial diversities compared to classical protocols.
   The SDS-based protocol enabled access to the highest sorghum endophytic
   diversities. Therefore, "SDS-extracted" sorghum root and stem microbiome
   diversities were analysed via 454 pyrosequencing, and this revealed that
   the two tissues harbour significantly different endophytic communities.
   Nevertheless, both communities are dominated by agriculturally important
   genera such as Microbacterium, Agrobacterium, Sphingobacterium,
   Herbaspirillum, Erwinia, Pseudomonas and Stenotrophomonas; which have
   previously been shown to play a role in plant growth promotion. This
   study shows that DNA extraction protocols introduce biases in
   culture-independent studies of environmental microbial communities by
   influencing the mDNA quality, which impacts the microbial diversity
   analyses and evaluation. Using the broad-spectrum SDS-based DNA
   extraction protocol allows the recovery of the most diverse endophytic
   communities associated with sorghum tissues and, as such, establishes a
   reliable basis for future study of endophytic communities.

AB OBJECTIVES: To validate the GT1M actigraph accelerometer step count
   function, and the Omron Walking Style Pro pedometer against
   accelerometer-based activity counts, and to compare pedometer-based and
   accelerometer-based steps in preschoolers.
   DESIGN: A sample of 41 preschoolers (21 boys, mean age 5.43±0.63 years)
   from one preschool in Flanders, Belgium, was included in data analysis.
   METHODS: Accelerometer-based and pedometer-based steps were
   simultaneously collected in this Flemish sample of preschool children.
   Preschoolers wore two motion sensors (accelerometer and pedometer) for
   four consecutive days. Pearson correlations were calculated to compare
   accelerometer activity counts with accelerometer-based steps,
   accelerometer activity counts with pedometer-based steps and
   accelerometer-based steps with pedometer-based steps. Bland-Altman
   analysis was carried out to investigate the agreement between the
   pedometer-based and the accelerometer-based steps.
   RESULTS: Accelerometer-based steps correlated moderately high with
   accelerometer activity counts per hour (r=0.77) and per day (r=0.82).
   Pedometer-based steps correlated moderately high with accelerometer
   activity counts per hour (r=0.65) and per day (r=0.64). High
   correlations were revealed between steps from both devices (hourly:
   r=0.92; daily: r=0.89). The Bland-Altman analysis showed a bias of
   221.81 (±1679.78) and the limits of agreement ranged from -3070.57 to
   3514.18 steps per day.
   CONCLUSIONS: Both the accelerometer-based as pedometer-based step counts
   are valid estimates of preschoolers' physical activity levels during
   free-living activities based on group estimates. High agreement between
   both step counts justifies combining and comparing pedometer- and
   accelerometer-based step counts.

AB Recent interest has been growing concerning points of maximum depth
   within folds, the sulcal pits, that can be used as reliable cortical
   landmarks. These remarkable points on the cortical surface are defined
   algorithmically as the outcome of an automatic extraction procedure. The
   influence of several crucial parameters of the reference technique (Im
   et al., 2010) has not been evaluated extensively, and no optimization
   procedure has been proposed so far. Designing an appropriate
   optimization framework for these parameters is mandatory to guarantee
   the reproducibility of results across studies and to ensure the
   feasibility of sulcal pit extraction and analysis on large cohorts. In
   this work, we propose a framework specifically dedicated to the
   optimization of the parameters of the method. This optimization
   framework relies on new measures for better quantifying the
   reproducibility of the number of sulcal pits per region across
   individuals, in line with the assumptions of one-to-one correspondence
   of sulcal roots across individuals which is an explicit aspect of the
   sulcal roots model (Regis et al., 2005). Our procedure benefits from a
   combination of improvements, including the use of a convenient sulcal
   depth estimation and is methodologically sound. Our experiments on two
   different groups of individuals, with a total of 137 subjects, show an
   increased reliability across subjects in deeper sulcal pits, as compared
   to the previous approach, and cover the entire cortical surface,
   including shallower and more variable folds that were not considered
   before. The effectiveness of our method ensures the feasibility of a
   systematic study of sulcal pits on large cohorts. On top of these
   methodological advances, we quantify the relationship between the
   reproducibility of the number of sulcal pits per region across
   individuals and their respective depth and demonstrate the relatively
   high reproducibility of several pits corresponding to shallower folds.
   Finally, we report new results regarding the local pit asymmetry,
   providing evidence that the algorithmic and conceptual approach defended
   here may contribute to better understanding of the key role of sulcal
   pits in neuroanatomy.

   provides maps such as the intra-neurite tissue volume fraction (vin),
   the orientation dispersion index (ODI) and the isotropic volume fraction
   (viso), and here we investigate their potential for spinal cord imaging.
   We scanned five healthy volunteers, four of whom twice, on a 3T MRI
   system with a ZOOM-EPI sequence. In accordance to the published NODDI
   protocol, multiple b-shells were acquired at cervical level and both
   NODDI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics were obtained and
   analysed to: i) characterise differences in grey and white matter
   (GM/WM); ii) assess the scan-rescan reproducibility of NODDI; iii)
   investigate the relationship between NODDI and DTI; and iv) compare the
   quality of fit of NODDI and DTI. Our results demonstrated that: i)
   anatomical features can be identified in NODDI maps, such as clear
   contrast between GM and WM in ODI; ii) the variabilities of vin and ODI
   are comparable to that of DTI and are driven by biological differences
   between subjects for ODI, have similar contribution from measurement
   errors and biological variation for vin, whereas viso shows higher
   variability, driven by measurement errors; iii) NODDI identifies
   potential sources contributing to DTI indices, as in the brain; and iv)
   NODDI outperforms DTI in terms of quality of fit. In conclusion, this
   work shows that NODDI is a useful model for in vivo diffusion MRI of the
   spinal cord, providing metrics closely related to tissue microstructure,
   in line with findings in the brain.

AB Background: The structure and dynamics of DNA are critically related to
   its function. Molecular dynamics simulations augment experiment by
   providing detailed information about the atomic motions. However, to
   date the simulations have not been long enough for convergence of the
   dynamics and structural properties of DNA.
   Methods: Molecular dynamics simulations performed with AMBER using the
   ff99SB force field with the parmbsc0 modifications, including ensembles
   of independent simulations, were compared to long timescale molecular
   dynamics performed with the specialized Anton MD engine on the B-DNA
   structure d(GCACGAACGAACGAACGC). To assess convergence, the decay of the
   average RMSD values over longer and longer time intervals was evaluated
   in addition to assessing convergence of the dynamics via the
   Kullback-Leibler divergence of principal component projection
   histograms.
   Results: These molecular dynamics simulations including one of the
   longest simulations of DNA published to date at similar to 44 mu s
   surprisingly suggest that the structure and dynamics of the DNA helix,
   neglecting the terminal base pairs, are essentially fully converged on
   the similar to 1-5 mu s timescale.
   Conclusions: We can now reproducibly converge the structure and dynamics
   of B-DNA helices, omitting the terminal base pairs, on the mu s time
   scale with both the AMBER and CHARMM C36 nucleic acid force fields.
   Results from independent ensembles of simulations starting from
   different initial conditions, when aggregated, match the results from
   long timescale simulations on the specialized Anton MD engine.
   General significance: With access to large-scale GPO resources or the
   specialized MD engine "Anton" it is possible for a variety of molecular
   systems to reproducibly and reliably converge the conformational
   ensemble of sampled structures. This article is part of a Special Issue

AB The feasibility of detecting the Aflatoxin B-1 in maize kernels
   inoculated with Aspergillus flans conidia in the field was assessed
   using near-infrared hyperspectral imaging technique. After pixel-level
   calibration, wavelength dependent offset, the masking method was adopted
   to reduce the noise and extract region of interest (ROI's) of spectral
   image, then an explanatory principal component analysis (PCA) followed
   by inverse PCA and secondary PCA was conducted to enhance the signal to
   noise ratio (SNR), reduce the dimensionality, and extract valuable
   information of spectral data. By interactive analysis between score
   image, score plot and load line plot, the first two PCs were found to
   indicate the spectral characteristics of healthy and infected maize
   kernels respectively. And the wavelengths of 1729 and 2344 nm were also
   identified to indicate AFB(1) exclusively. The n-dimensional
   visualization method based on PC3 to PC7 was adapted to select the two
   classes of end members as the input data of the spectral angle mapper
   (SAM) classifier to separate the aflatoxin infection and clean kernels.
   The result was compared with chemical analysis of Aflatest (R). And the
   verification accuracy of pixel level reached 100% except the tip parts
   of some healthy kernels were falsely identified as aflatoxin
   contamination. Furthermore, another 26 maize kernels were selected as an
   independent data set to verify the reproducibility of the method
   proposed, and the detection accuracy attained to 92.3%, which
   demonstrated that hyperspectral imaging technique can be used to detect
   aflatoxin in artificially inoculated maize kernels in the field. (C)

AB This paper presented a revised particle impact noise detection (PIND)
   system to detect loose particles in the sealed electronic devices. The
   type of particle material is the valuable information to trace the
   particle' origins and assess the potential harmfulness. The most
   traditional classification model cannot effectively recognize the types
   of material due to particle impact acoustic signals with characteristics
   such as non-stationary, poor repeatability and reproducibility. To
   address this problem, a new method of pattern recognition for material
   identification is proposed based on modified Mel frequency cepstral
   coefficient (MFCC) and hidden Markov model (HMM). First, to be more
   suitable for target identification of different material of particle
   acoustic signals, the relationship between the MFCC features and the Mel
   filter bank is derived, and the modified filter bank is proposed. The
   modified MFCC features are then mapped into HMMs, where the model number
   with the maximum probability is chosen as the identified class. Finally,
   experiments have been carried out with different features and
   classifiers. The results show that the proposed method can effectively
   distinguish the four types of materials including wire, chip, aluminum
   and tin. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   low-voltage organic thin-film transistors based on
   dinaphtho[2,3-b:2',3'-f]thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (DNTT) are thoroughly
   characterized with respect to their optical functionality. The
   fundamental light-dependent effect, i.e., a large but slow
   threshold-voltage shift based on charge trapping in the aluminum oxide
   of the gate dielectric or at the semiconductor-dielectric interface, is
   analyzed depending on various parameters, such as biasing conditions,
   integration time, wavelength and power of the incoming light as well as
   the channel length. An optimized 3-phase operation consisting of reset,
   integration and read-out is proposed in order to maximize
   reproducibility, sensitivity and responsivity of the phototransistors.
   Two distinct regimes, an absorption-limited and a trapping-limited
   regime, are identified depending on the density of available trappable
   electrons, which is deter mined by the optical input power and the
   integration time. The maximum operation frequency is found to be larger
   in phototransistors with shorter channel lengths. Based on these
   results, an organic gesture recognition system with a refresh rate of 1

AB We propose two simple methods that transform a force curve obtained by a
   surface force apparatus (SFA) into a density distribution of a liquid
   near a surface of the SFA probe. The transform methods are derived based
   on the statistical mechanics of simple liquids, where the liquid is an
   ensemble of small spheres. The solvent species is limited to only one
   component and two-body potential between the solvent spheres is
   arbitrary. However, two-body potential between the SFA probe and the
   solvent is restricted to rigid potential (i.e., the transform methods
   are derived within the restriction of the rigid potential). In addition,
   Kirkwood and linear superposition approximations are applied in order to
   derive the transform methods. The transform methods are simply tested in
   both hard-sphere fluid and Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluid with hard core
   potential. The tests are computationally practiced using a
   three-dimensional integral equation theory. It is found that the
   transform method with Kirkwood superposition approximation (transform
   method 1) generally reproduces the more precise solvation structure than
   that with linear superposition approximation (transform method 2). In
   the test of the hard sphere solvent, it is found that the
   reproducibility becomes better as the number density of the solvent is
   lower. Furthermore, it is found in the test of the LJ fluid that the
   reproducibility becomes better as the two-body potential between the SFA
   probe and the solvent approaches rigid potential. This is because, the
   transform methods are derived within the model of the rigid potential.
   It is verified that the transform methods are useful for obtaining of a
   rough image of the solvation structure. (However, if evaporation or
   solidification, a phase transition in a local space sandwiched between
   the two surfaces, occurs while the experiment, the transform methods
   should not be used. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   protocol included T1-turbo spin-echo, T2-turbo spin-echo with fat

   Minimum and maximum percentage variability were 10 % and 19 % for T2*
   (84-91 % of reproducibility). Maximum values of minimum detectable
   differences between limbs was 16 % (with 95 % CI: 2-37). Intra- and
   inter-observer agreement of the three radiologists for T2* was
   considered good. Evaluating the combined influence of the observer and
   of the repeated measurements the reproducibility was 87-98 %.
   T2* measurement of the peripheral nerves is precise and reproducible.
   The healthy contralateral side can be used as an internal control.
   Variations in T2* values up to 16 % have to be considered.

AB Combining the advantages of the biosensor field with the problem of
   detecting Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in human samples, an inexpensive,
   simple and disposable electrochemical immunosensor for glycoprotein B
   detection in urine is proposed. Glycoprotein B has been chosen once is
   the dominant antigen of HCMV. The approach is based on a sandwich-type
   immunoassay, with the HCMV glycoprotein B sandwiched between the
   Anti-HCMV antibody adsorbed onto the working electrode, and the
   Anti-HCMV labeled with gold nanoparticles. Glycoprotein B detection was
   carried out through electrochemical stripping analysis of silver
   nanoparticles quantitatively deposited on the immunosensor through
   catalysis by the nanogold labels. The influence of different steps in
   the immunosensor construction, namely the silver deposition time, silver
   enhancer concentration, antibody concentration, BSA concentration and
   glycoprotein B incubation time, were examined and optimized. The method
   showed a linear dependence between glycoprotein B concentration and the
   corresponding anodic stripping peak current, resulting in detection
   limits of 3.3 +/- 1.7 ng/mL for samples prepared in buffer and 3.2 +/-
   0.2 ng/mL for urine samples, suggesting that the biological matrix does
   not interfere with the immunosensor detection capability. Given its mode
   of preparation, by physical adsorption of the capture antibody in the
   working electrode, the immunosensor also exhibited an acceptable
   reproducibility, with a residual standard deviation of 13.5% for samples
   prepared in buffer and 11.2% for urine samples, thereby presenting a
   promising development potential for clinical applications. (C) 2014

AB In this work, a newly developed UHV-based high precision low background
   setup for hydrogen thermal desorption analysis (TDA) of metallic samples
   is presented. Using an infrared heating with a low thermal capacity
   enables a precise control of the temperature and rapid cool down of the
   measurement chamber. This novel TDA-set up is superior in sensitivity to
   almost every standard hydrogen analyzer available commercially due to
   the special design of the measurement chamber, resulting in a very low
   hydrogen background. No effects of background drift characteristic as
   for carrier gas based TDA instruments were observed, ensuring linearity
   and reproducibility of the analysis. This setup will prove to be
   valuable for detailed investigations of hydrogen trapping sites in
   steels and other alloys. With a determined limit of detection of 5.9 x
   10(-3) mu g g(-1) hydrogen the developed instrument is able to determine
   extremely low hydrogen amounts even at very low hydrogen desorption
   rates. This work clearly demonstrates the great potential of ultra-high
   vacuum thermal desorption mass spectroscopy instrumentation. (C) 2015

AB Self-Interrogation Neutron Resonance Densitometry (SINRD) is a new NDA
   technique that was developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) to
   improve existing nuclear safeguards measurements for LWR fuel
   assemblies. The SINRD detector consists of four fission chambers (FCs)
   wrapped with different absorber filters to isolate different parts of
   the neutron energy spectrum and one ion chamber (IC) to measure the
   gross gamma rate. As a result, two different techniques can be utilized
   using the same SINRD detector unit and hardware. These techniques are
   the Passive Neutron Multiplication Counter (PNMC) method and the SINRD
   method. The focus of the work described in this paper is the analysis of
   experimental measurements of fresh and spent PWR fuel assemblies that
   were performed at LANE and the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute
   (KAERI), respectively, using the SINRD detector. The purpose of these
   experiments was to assess the following capabilities of the SINRD
   detector: 1) reproducibility of measurements to quantify systematic
   errors, 2) sensitivity to water gap between detector and fuel assembly,
   3) sensitivity and penetrability to the removal of fuel rods from the
   assembly, and 4) use of PNMC/SINIRD ratios to quantify neutron
   multiplication and/or fissile content The results from these simulations
   and measurements provide valuable experimental data that directly
   supports safeguards research and development (R&D) efforts on the
   viability of passive neutron NDA techniques and detector designs for
   partial defect verification of spent fuel assemblies. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   (MWCNT-NH2) and ionic liquids (IL) 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
   hexafluorophosphate ([BMIM][PF6]) modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE)
   was developed. Compared with bare electrode, [MWCNT-NH2]-IL modified
   electrode significantly enhanced the oxidation peak current of FAR,
   suggesting that the modified electrode can remarkably improve the
   determining sensitivity of FAR. Electrochemical studies suggested that
   the [MWCNT-NH2]-IL composite system provided a synergistic augmentation
   effect on the voltammetric behavior of electrochemical oxidation of FAR.
   Under the optimum conditions, this constructed biosensor exhibited two
   linear relationships with FAR concentration range from 5.6 x 10(-7) to
   2.8 x 10(-5) mol/L and 3.3 x 10(-5) to 1.6 x 10(-4) mol/L, respectively.
   The detection limit was 3.1 x 10(-8) mol/L (S/N = 3). The proposed
   method can satisfy the detection of FAR in routine clinical analysis.
   The fabricated electrode has been successfully applied to the
   determination of FAR in real samples and exhibited good reproducibility,
   stability and anti-interference. Moreover, the electrochemical method
   and spectroscopy method are also used to study the interaction between
   FAR and human serum albumin (HSA). The binding constant and the number
   of binding sites between FAR and HSA obtained by electrochemical method
   were consistent with the fluorescence analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper describes the electrochemical characterisation of gold and
   platinum microdevices mass fabricated using silicon technology. Specific
   attention was paid to allow in situ electrochemical detection of
   silicate in seawater. Thus, using a silicon nitride (Si3N4) inorganic
   passivation layer patterned using Inductively Coupled Plasma Chemical
   Vapor Deposition (ICP-CVD), coupled with a non-aggressive liftoff based
   process, different electrodes were isolated electrically: one gold or
   platinum working electrode named "macroelectrode" (2 mm of diameter),
   four gold or platinum working ultramicroelectrodes (UME) (15 mu m of
   diameter), one platinum counter electrode and one silver electrode which
   can be used as a reference electrode after its chlorination. Their small
   size and mass fabrication make them very promising for oceanographic
   applications. As some components of microdevices release silicate and
   contaminate the solution, after being immersed in seawater, these
   microdevices were inserted in a specific cell that only puts the
   electrodes in contact with the seawater solution. Gold has been tested
   as a possible material for working electrodes but its lack of adherence
   to the passivation layer in seawater solutions led to nonaccurate
   measurements. On the contrary, pas sivation layer on platinum electrodes
   resists to the seawater corrosive medium. The analytical performances of
   the platinum microdevices has been tested through different silicate
   calibrations and shows an outstanding accuracy and reproducibility when
   measurements are performed, especially with the macroelectrodes which
   showed only 2.8% signal variation after four months of use and a limit
   of quantification of 0.50 timol L-1 suitable for oceanographic

AB The development of a sandwich-type biosensor for glucose quantification
   is presented. This work is focused on the optimization of the enzymatic
   matrix of the bio sensor. The best performance was found for an
   enzymatic matrix composed by 30% w/w mucin, 70% w/w albumin, 1.35 U
   glucose oxidase (GOX) per sensor, and glutaraldehyde diluted to 3%. The
   crosslinking with glutaraldehyde transforms this mixture into a hydrogel
   that is entrapped between two membranes of polycarbonate. The selected
   sandwich-type biosensor showed very good response time, sensitivity,
   stability, and sensor-to-sensor reproducibility.
   According to the results presented in this manuscript, a biosensor
   prepared with very high amount of enzyme would not necessarily increase
   the analytical signal. Simulated curves are compared with experimental
   data to explain the dependence of sensitivity on the concentration of
   enzyme. In addition, this kind of comparison represents a quite simple
   way to estimate the value of vmax 0.13 M s(-1) from the amperometric
   response of a sensor prepared with 1.34 U of GOX.
   Considering that sandwich-type biosensors are commonly assembled as part
   of devices where the sample is diluted with buffer, the more than 3
   orders of magnitude of linear behavior of this sensor would ensure the
   possibility for assessing any sample. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   nanocomposite provides more active sites for Pd nucleation. And the
   synergistic effect of rGO, MWCNTs and Pd NPs significantly improved the
   electrochemical performance of the modified electrode. Pd particles can
   combine HIgG antibodies and enhance the conductivity of electrode. The
   structure of rGO-MWCNT-Pd nanocomposite was characterized by scanning

   microscopy (HRTEM). The HRTEM of Pd NPs and energy dispersive X-ray
   spectroscopy (EDS) of rGO-MWCNT-Pd nanocomposite confirmed the
   composition of the as-synthesized nanocomposite. K-3[Fe(CN)(6)] was used
   as a redox probe. HIgG antibodies are immobilized onto the nanocomposite
   via Pd-NH2 bonds. Cyclic voltammetry and square wave voltammetry were
   used to characterize the recognizability of HIgG. Under optimum
   experimental conditions, the proposed immunoassay exhibited a low

AB A color changeable cellulose triacetate (CTA) membrane-based optode has

   Hg(II) ions in aqueous solutions. The sensing layer of the optode
   consists of phenylthiosemicarbazide derivative of rhodamine 6G
   immobilized in a plasticized CTA membrane. The colorless optode film on
   reaction with Hg(II) turned pink, in color, and the intensity of the
   color was found to be directly proportional to the amount of Hg(II). The
   sensing mechanism is based on the mercury-induced spirolactum ring
   opening followed by its cyclization to form highly conjugated system
   which leads to the development of pink color. Various experimental
   parameters such as pH, optode composition and response time have been
   optimized. Under these conditions, the sensor showed a wide linear
   dynamic range of 10-5000 ng mL(-1) Hg(II), with a detection limit of 1.3
   ng mL(-1). In addition to its stability and reproducibility, optode
   showed a high selectivity toward Hg(II) ions as compared to other
   coexisting ions in real water samples. The developed optode is suitable
   for rapid and onsite detection of Hg(II) ions in a variety of aqueous
   samples. The sensor was successfully applied for the determination of

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The ketamine model has dominated drug discovery in
   schizophrenia over the past decade, supported by genetic and postmortem
   evidence implicating glutamatergic transmission. This review assesses
   recent successes and disappointments of glutamatergic agents and
   identifies promising new directions.
   RECENT FINDINGS: Strategies focused on enhancing activity of the
   N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor via direct agonists at the glycine
   site or by inhibition of glycine reuptake have produced modest and often
   inconsistent evidence of efficacy, as have approaches to reduce
   excessive glutamate release by lamotrigine or by mGluR2/3 agonists.
   Strategies targeting alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole
   propionic acid (AMPA) receptors have also met with only limited success.
   Newer approaches include selective allosteric modulation of NMDA
   receptor subunits and of mGluR5 receptors. In addition, intracellular
   pathways downstream of NMDA receptors may also provide new treatment
   targets, as exemplified by phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors.
   SUMMARY: Targeting glutamatergic transmission remains one of the most
   promising strategies in schizophrenia, particularly early in the course
   of illness, but therapeutic approaches may require greater specificity
   for receptor subtype type, illness phase, and individual biology in
   order to enhance efficacy and overcome problems with reproducibility of
   clinical results.

AB BACKGROUND: Gallbladder disease is highly related to inflammation, but
   the inflammatory processes are not well understood. Bile provides a
   direct substrate in assessing the local inflammatory response that
   develops in the gallbladder. To assess the reproducibility of measuring
   inflammatory markers in bile, we designed a methods study of 69
   multiplexed immune-related markers measured in bile obtained from
   gallstone patients.
   METHODS: To evaluate assay performance, a total of 18 bile samples were
   tested twice within the same plate for each analyte, and the 18 bile
   samples were tested on two different days for each analyte. We used the
   following performance parameters: detectability, coefficient of
   variation (CV), intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and percent
   agreement (concordance among replicate measures above and below
   detection limit). Furthermore, we examined the association of analyte
   levels with gallstone characteristics such as type, numbers, and size.
   RESULTS: All but 3 analytes (Stem Cell Factor, SCF; Thrombopoietin, TPO;
   sIL-1RI) were detectable in bile. 52 of 69 (75.4%) analytes had
   detectable levels for at least 50% of the subjects tested. The
   within-plate CVs were ⩽25% for 53 of 66 (80.3%) detectable analytes, and
   across-plate CVs were ⩽25% for 32 of 66 (48.5%) detectable analytes.
   Moreover, 64 of 66 (97.0%) analytes had ICC values of at least 0.8.
   Lastly, the percent agreement was high between replicates for all of the
   analytes (median; within plate, 97.2%; across plate, 97.2%). In
   exploratory analyses, we assessed analyte levels by gallstone
   characteristics and found that levels for several analytes decreased
   with increasing size of the largest gallstone per patient.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that multiplex assays can be used to
   reliably measure cytokines and chemokines in bile. In addition,
   gallstone size was inversely related to the levels of select analytes,
   which may aid in identifying critical pathways and mechanisms associated
   with the pathogenesis of gallbladder diseases.

   sharing soil spectral data between users, as spectral variations can be
   encountered from one protocol to the next. This further prevents the
   generation of a robust model for a given soil property using the
   worldwide data archive. To solve this problem in the laboratory, a joint
   project between CSIRO - Perth and Tel Aviv University (TAU) was
   conducted to establish a standard protocol for soil measurement, along
   with the use of an internal standard procedure to generate correction
   factors to normalize all possible variations to a soil benchmark (SBM)
   setup. The method is based on a proof of concept reported by Pimestein
   et al. (2011) for the use of an internal soil standard (ISS), a concept
   adopted from the wet chemistry discipline. To formulate the ISS method
   proposed herein, we used samples from two sand dunes that were
   characterized for their mineralogy, stability and reflectance
   reproducibility to be suitable for the standardization mission. These
   samples were found to be stable in space and time and to hold a stable
   soil structure and spectral response common to soils. Five soil samples
   were used to examine the performance of the suggested ISS approach. The
   ISS and soil samples were carefully measured for reflectance at the
   CSIRO laboratory using a new calibrated ASD and different protocols and
   procedures harboring minor and major differences. In addition, the exact
   same ISS and soil samples were measured in the TAU laboratory with a
   different ASD, protocols and ambient conditions. A systemic quantitative
   study was conducted to judge the performance of the ISS method. The
   results demonstrated that each protocol provides significant spectral
   variations from the SBM protocol, but all can be corrected to the SBM
   measurements. The results are promising as they can be achieved with any
   protocol if the systematic variations are kept constant. The ISS samples
   can also be used to track spectrometer deterioration and
   measurement-setup stability. The current paper provides information on
   how to obtain and use the ISS, and recommends a simple protocol for
   measuring soil reflectance under laboratory conditions. (C) 2015

AB Femtosecond near-infrared lasers are widely used for a number of
   ophthalmic procedures, with flap cutting in the laser-assisted in situ
   keratomileusis (LASIK) surgery being the most frequent one. At the same
   time, lasers of this type, equipped with harmonic generators, have been
   shown to deliver enough ultraviolet (UV) power for the second stage of
   the LASIK procedure, the stromal ablation. However, the speed of the
   ablation reported so far was well below the currently accepted
   standards. Our purpose was to perform high-speed photorefractive
   keratectomy (PRK) with femtosecond UV pulses in rabbits and to evaluate
   its predictability, reproducibility and healing response. The laser
   source delivered femtosecond 206 nm pulses with a repetition rate of 50
   kHz and an average power of 400 mW. Transepithelial PRK was performed
   using two different ablation protocols, to a total depth of 110 and 150
   mum. The surface temperature was monitored during ablation; haze
   dynamics and histological samples were evaluated to assess outcomes of
   the PRK procedure. For comparison, analogous excimer ablation was
   performed. Increase of the ablation speed up to 1.6 s/diopter for a 6 mm
   optical zone using femtosecond UV pulses did not significantly impact
   the healing process.

AB ZSM-5 is one of the most well-known members of zeolite family owing to
   its huge number of industrial applications due to its instinct acidity
   and well-defined micropore structure. It can be synthesized in a one or
   multi-step hydrothermal procedure employing versatile synthesis
   parameters. Here, seed-assisted OSDA (organic structure directing
   agent)-free synthesis method based on using TPABr-silicalite-1 as
   structure directing agent is proposed as an economical route considering
   reproducibility and short synthesis time benefits as well. This two-step
   synthesis technique exploits an enriched aluminum template-free
   precursor gel containing zeolite nuclei that attach and grow around high
   siliceous zeolite cores named as silicalite-1. The prepared ZSM-5
   product was characterized using XRD, SEM, FT-IR, EDX, elemental mapping,
   ICP and N 2 adsorption-desorption techniques. Results confirmed the
   fully crystalline pure MFI structure of the obtained product. The
   catalytic behavior of the fabricated material as support was evaluated
   in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH). The PtSn-based ZSM-5
   catalyst maintained its activity to a certain level of about 31% propane
   conversion after 7 h time on stream with more than 89% total olefins
   selectivity. It seems that seeding along with using a cheap template
   like TPABr in the synthesis of seeds is an efficient method which has
   the potential to be emerged as a promising method for the ZSM-5
   large-scale production. [All rights reserved Elsevier].

AB The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) in a two-way analysis of
   variance is a ratio involving three variance components. Two recently
   developed methods for constructing confidence intervals (CI's) for the
   ICC are the Generalized Confidence Interval (GCI) and Modified Large
   Sample (MLS) methods. The resulting intervals have been shown to
   maintain nominal coverage. But methods for determining sample size for
   GCI and MLS intervals are lacking. Sample size methods that guarantee
   control of the mean width for GCI and MLS intervals are developed. In
   the process, two variance reduction methods are employed, called
   dependent conditioning and inverse Rao-Blackwellization. Asymptotic
   results provide lower bounds for mean CI widths, and show that MLS and
   GCI widths are asymptotically equivalent. Simulation studies are used to
   investigate the new methods. A real data example is used and application
   issues discussed. The new methods are shown to result in adequate sample
   size estimates, the asymptotic estimates are accurate, and the variance
   reduction techniques are effective. A sample size program is
   developed.(1) Future extensions of these results are discussed. (C) 2014

AB This paper presented a revised particle impact noise detection (PIND)
   system to detect loose particles in the sealed electronic devices. The
   type of particle material is the valuable information to trace the
   particle' origins and assess the potential harmfulness. The most
   traditional classification model cannot effectively recognize the types
   of material due to particle impact acoustic signals with characteristics
   such as non-stationary, poor repeatability and reproducibility. To
   address this problem, a new method of pattern recognition for material
   identification is proposed based on modified Mel frequency cepstral
   coefficient (MFCC) and hidden Markov model (HMM). First, to be more
   suitable for target identification of different material of particle
   acoustic signals, the relationship between the MFCC features and the Mel
   filter bank is derived, and the modified filter bank is proposed. The
   modified MFCC features are then mapped into HMMs, where the model number
   with the maximum probability is chosen as the identified class. Finally,
   experiments have been carried out with different features and
   classifiers. The results show that the proposed method can effectively
   distinguish the four types of materials including wire, chip, aluminum
   and tin. [All rights reserved Elsevier].

   free nucleotide monophosphates in human milk is proposed. It involves
   centrifugal ultrafiltration (CUF) as sample treatment and capillary
   electrophoresis-electrospray mass spectrometry (CE-ESI-MS) for
   separation and simultaneous quantification.
   The optimised method, applied to the analysis of human milk samples,
   included their dilution (1:5) with water followed by CUF treatment. No
   matrix effects were found. The method provided limits of detection
   between 0.08 and 0.13 mu g mL(-1) and limits of quantification between
   0.26 and 0.431 mu g mL(-1). The intralaboratory repeatability and
   reproducibility afforded relative standard deviation values lower than
   10%.
   The method was applied to the study of the effects of Holder
   pasteurisation and high-pressure processing on the nucleotide contents
   in samples from a human milk bank. The results showed concentration
   values between 0.5 and 10 mu g mL(-1), with higher concentrations for
   the samples treated by pasteurisation. The effect of freezing time on
   the content of nucleotides was also assessed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Suppressed ion chromatography with the use of a conductivity detector

   When a mixed solution of sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, and
   acetone was used as the mobile phase, simultaneous determination of
   eight inorganic anions (i.e., fluoride, chloride, nitrite, nitrate,
   sulphite, phosphate, sulphate, and thiosulphate) was completed in
   approximately 25 min. Linearity, reproducibility, and detection limits
   were determined for the proposed method. In the case of sulphite
   detection, a linear calibration curve with a good correlation
   coefficient of 0.9992 was obtained from the peak height of sulphite with
   a relative standard deviation (n = 6) 1.48%. In addition, the detection
   limit of sulphite was 0.27 mg/L at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3.
   Further, the developed method was applied for the determination of

   screen-printed electrodes were firstly modified with a mixed monolayer
   of a primary thiolated DNA aptamer and a spacer thiol,
   6-nnercapto-1-hexanol. VEGF protein was then incubated with the
   aptasensor. An enzyme-amplified detection scheme, based on the coupling
   of a streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate and secondary
   biotinylated aptanner was then applied. The enzyme catalyzed the
   hydrolysis of the electroinactive 1-naphthylphosphate to 1-naphthol;
   this product is electroactive and has been detected by means of
   differential pulse voltamnnetry (DPV). The aptasensor response was found
   to be linearly related to the target concentration between 0 and 250
   nnnol L-1; the detection limit was 30 nmol L-1. The performance of the
   immunoassay in terms of reproducibility and selectivity has been also

AB Bimetallic Ni-Cr nano-oxide catalysts were synthesized by thermal

   for the oxidation of methanol. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray
   diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The electroactivity of
   the catalysts towards methanol oxidation in a solution containing 0.25 M
   NaOH and 1.0 M MeOH was examined using cyclic voltammetry and
   chronoamperometry. The results indicate that a mixture of
   rhombohedral-structured NiO and Cr2O3 nanocrystals generated at the
   calcination temperature of 500-700 degrees C while octahedral-structured
   spinel NiCr2O4 formed at higher temperature. The influence of metallic
   molar ratio on the electrocatalytic performance of the catalysts was
   studied. The Ni-Cr nano-oxides prepared at comparatively low temperature
   displayed significantly higher catalytic activity and durability in
   alkaline solution toward electrooxidation of methanol compared with the
   pure nano NiO. The results indicate a synergy effect between NiO and
   Cr2O3 enhancing the electrocatalytic properties of the bimetallic Ni-Cr
   nano-oxide catalysts. Meanwhile, NiCr2O4 hardly increased the activity
   and durability of the catalyst. In addition, the Ni-Cr catalyst also
   exhibited excellent stability and good reproducibility. Therefore, Ni-Cr
   nano-oxide catalyst may be a suitable and cheap electrocatalyst for

   batch-to-batch uniformity of the main physico-chemical features of the
   nanoparticles in the setting of the large-scale GMP process. In the
   clinical trial, 29 patients were treated with this nanoparticle between
   2007 and 2010. Pharmacokinetic data of anti-EGFR-ILs-dox collected

AB Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC*GC) has been
   rapidly growing in popularity. The GC*GC separation is performed by
   interfacing a modulator between two columns of different selectivities.
   The modulator periodically traps and then re-injects the analytes
   eluting from the first column into the second column. The most popular
   GC*GC systems require consumables such as liquid N2 for the trapping
   function of the modulator. Although these systems are very effective,
   their costs are a hindrance to more widespread use. A new, single-stage
   thermal modulator for GC*GC that requires no consumables has been
   developed and tested. The device traps analytes using a proprietary
   stainless steel capillary trap compressed between two ceramic cooling
   pads. Analytes are thermally desorbed from the trap into the second
   column via resistive heating. To evaluate this system, a routine
   accredited method for the analysis of polychlorinated biphenyls,
   organochlorine pesticides and chlorobenzenes was run using the new
   modulator and its performance was compared to that of an industry
   standard modulation system. Within-day repeatability (% RSD ranging from
   2% to 13%), between-day reproducibility (% RSD from 3% to 15%), as well
   as between-trap reproducibility were assessed. The results are very
   encouraging as negligible shifts in retention times (% RSD from 0.3% to
   0.6% in the 1st dimension and 0.8% to 2% in the 2nd dimension) were
   observed for both within-day and day-to-day comparisons of the studied
   samples (ANOVA, p=0.9893 for the sediment reference material compared),
   and the quantitative results were comparable. Routine analysis and
   quality control applications will benefit from the improved
   reproducibility as the variances in cold/hot jet flows and temperatures
   are eliminated. An overview of the device operation and the results from
   this study are summarized.

AB The feeding of a fed-batch cultivation producing recombinant protein was
   controlled by a soft sensor set-up. It was assumed that the control
   approach could be based on the cell's production of carbon dioxide and
   that this parameter indicates the metabolic state occurring at induced
   protein expression. The soft sensor used the on-line signals from a
   carbon dioxide analyser and a near-infrared (NIR) probe for biomass to
   estimate the specific production rate [Formula: see text] . Control
   experiments were carried out with various [Formula: see text] set-points
   where we observe that the feeding of nutrients to the culture could
   easily be controlled and resulted in a decreased variability compared to
   uncontrolled cultivations. We therefore suggest that this control
   approach could serve as an alternative to other commonly applied methods
   such as controlling the cell's overflow metabolism of acetate or the
   cell's specific growth rate. However, further studies of the internal
   metabolic fluxes of CO2 during protein expression would be recommended
   for a more precise characterization of the relationship between
   [Formula: see text] and protein expression in order to fully interpret
   the control behaviour.

   manufacturing process, traditionally handmade. Within this process, the
   human operator plays a central role (i.e. knowledge and expertise),
   whereas the (intelligent) automation is carrying out physical operation,
   which is guided and supervised by the human operator. Process guiding
   assistance is given based on the formalisation of the
   human-machine-interaction. By deducing information of interest with
   respect to the current process goal, the established process model can
   be easily used for supervision and assistance. The integrated
   human-automation-system is initially evaluated. The results are
   discussed for the future work with respect to the individual process
   understanding and process reproducibility.

AB A novel hyphenated technique, namely the combination of stir bar
   sorptive extraction (SBSE) with isotope dilution direct analysis in real
   time (DART) Orbitrap (TM) mass spectrometry (OT-MS) is presented for the
   extraction of phosphoric acid alkyl esters (tri- (TnBP), di- (HDBP), and
   mono-butyl phosphate (H2MBP)) from aqueous samples. First, SBSE of
   phosphate esters was performed using a Twister (TM) coated with 24 mu L
   of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as the extracting phase. SBSE was
   optimized for extraction pH, phase ratio (PDMS volume/aqueous phase
   volume), stirring speed, extraction time and temperature. Then, coupling
   of SBSE to DART/Orbitrap-MS was achieved by placing the Twister (TM) in
   the middle of an open-ended glass tube between the DART and the Orbitrap
   (TM). The DART mass spectrometric response of phosphate esters was
   probed using commercially available and synthesized alkyl phosphate
   ester standards. The positive ion full scan spectra of alkyl phosphate
   triesters (TnBP) was characterized by the product of self-protonation [M
   + H](+) and, during collision-induced dissociation (CID), the major
   fragmentation ions corresponded to consecutive loss of alkyl chains.
   Negative ionization gave abundant [M - H](-) ions for both HDnBP and
   H2MnBP. Twisters (TM) coated with PDMS successfully extracted phosphate
   acid esters (tri-, di- and mono-esters) granted that the analytes are
   present in the aqueous solution in the neutral form.
   SBSE/DART/Orbitrap-MS results show a good linearity between the
   concentrations and relative peak areas for the analytes in the
   concentration range studied (0.1-750 ng mL(-1)). Reproducibility of this
   SBSE/DART/Orbitrap-MS method was evaluated in terms of %RSD by
   extracting a sample of water fortified with the analytes. The %RSDs for
   TnBP, HDnBP and H2MnBP were 4, 3 and 3% (n = 5) using the respective
   perdeuterated internal standards. Matrix effects were investigated by
   matrix matched calibration standards using underground water samples
   (UWS) and river water samples (RWS). Matrix effects were effectively
   compensated by the addition of the perdeuterated internal standards. The
   application of this new SBSE/DART/Orbitrap-MS method should be very
   valuable for on-site sampling/monitoring, limiting the transport of
   large volumes of water samples from the sampling site to the laboratory.

AB Globally, human exposures to organophosphate (OP) insecticides may pose
   a significant burden to the health of mothers and their developing
   fetuses. Unfortunately, relevant data is limited in certain areas of the
   world concerning sources of exposure to OP insecticides in pregnant
   populations. To begin to address this gap in information for Puerto
   Rico, we studied repeated measures of urinary concentrations of 10 OP
   insecticide metabolites among 54 pregnant women from the northern karst
   region of the island. We also collected demographic data and
   self-reported information on the consumption of fruits, vegetables, and
   legumes in the past 48 h before urine collection and home pest-related
   issues. We calculated the distributions of the urinary biomarkers and
   compared them to women of reproductive age from the general U.S.
   population. We also used statistical models accounting for correlated
   data to assess within-subject temporal variability of the urinary
   biomarkers and to identify predictors of exposure. We found that for all
   but two metabolites (para-nitrophenol [PNP], diethylthiophosphate
   [DETP], 50th or 95th percentile urinary concentrations (the metric that
   was used for comparison was based on the biomarker's detection
   frequency) of the other eight metabolites (3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol
   [TCPY], 2-isopropyl-4-methyl-6-hydroxy-pyrimidine, malathion
   dicarboxylic acid, diethylphosphate, diethyldithiophosphate,
   dimethylphosphate, dimethylthiophosphate [DMTP],
   dimethyldithiophosphate) were somewhat lower in our cohort compared with
   similarly aged women from the continental United States, TCPY, PNP,
   DETP, and DMTP, which were the only urinary metabolites detected in
   greater than 50% of the samples, had poor reproducibility (intraclass
   correlation coefficient range: 0.19-0.28) during pregnancy. Positive
   predictors of OP insecticide exposure included: age; marital or
   employment status; consumption of cherries, grape juice, peanuts, peanut
   butter, or raisins; and residential application of pesticides. Further
   research is needed to understand what aspects of the predictors
   identified influence OP insecticide exposure during pregnancy. (C) 2015

AB BACKGROUND: Two new immunoassay methods for aldosterone assay using
   automated platforms recently became available into market. The main aim
   of the present study is to evaluate the analytical performance of these
   automated direct immunoassay methods, and also to compare their
   analytical characteristics to those of the most popular RIA and EIA
   methods used in an Italian External Quality Assessment (EQA) study.
   METHODS: In this study analytical performances of two aldosterone
   immunoassays using the IDS iSYS and DiaSorin LIAISON fully automated
   platforms, were evaluated. Results obtained with the two platforms in
   EDTA plasma samples of healthy subjects and patients were compared with
   those obtained by RIA and EIA methods used in the Italian EQA scheme,
   named Immunocheck study.
   RESULTS: The two automated methods showed similar analytical
   performances: LoD 83.9 vs 92.2pmol/L, LoQ 104.4 vs 111.1pmol/L,
   respectively; moreover, the within-run and total imprecision values
   showed CV% between 8.1 and 14.1 for samples with 180.8 and 387.2pmol/L
   concentration for both methods. There was a close linear regression
   between methods, however we found a significant proportional bias
   between LIAISON and iSYS methods. The EQA samples results obtained with
   these two methods were highly correlated to the consensus mean values.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that aldosterone values measured with the
   two automated methods actually show better reproducibility, shorter
   laboratory Turn Around Time (TAT) and require less "hands on labor"
   compared to RIA and EIA immunoassays. However, in our study significant
   bias was observed in result comparison, this means that translating
   aldosterone concentration in clinical information an appropriate
   definition of reference ranges for each method is mandatory.

AB BACKGROUND: Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a class of endogenous RNAs, have
   emerged as an enigmatic class of RNAs. Little is known about their value
   in the diagnosis of cancers.
   METHODS: The targeted circRNA of this study was selected using two
   circRNA databases: CircBase (http://circbase.org/) and circ2Traits
   (http://gyanxet-beta.com/circdb/). Divergent primers, rather than
   commonly used convergent primers, for the circRNA were designed. The
   circRNA levels in 101 paired gastric cancer tissues and adjacent
   nontumorous tissues from surgical gastric cancer patients and 36 paired
   plasma samples from preoperative and postoperative gastric cancer
   patients were analyzed by real-time quantitative reverse
   transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The specificity of
   the amplified products was measured by melting curve analysis and DNA
   sequencing. To observe the stability of circRNA, three randomly selected
   samples of gastric cancer tissues were stored at room temperature, 4°C
   and -20°C, and then, their circRNA levels were analyzed. To verify the
   reproducibility of qRT-PCR, circRNA levels were detected in a set of
   specimens (n=15) in two independent experiments with an interval of one
   day. Then, the correlation of their Ct values was determined. The
   relationships between circRNA expression levels and clinicopathological
   factors of patients with gastric cancer were further analyzed by one-way
   analysis of variance. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
   was established to evaluate the diagnostic value.
   RESULTS: Hsa_circ_002059, a typical circular RNA, was first found to be
   significantly downregulated in gastric cancer tissues compared with
   paired adjacent nontumorous tissues (p<0.001). Its levels in plasma
   collected from postoperative gastric cancer patients were found
   significantly different from those from preoperative gastric cancer
   patients. The area under the ROC curve was 0.73. Importantly, we further
   found that lower expression levels were significantly correlated with
   distal metastasis (P=0.036), TNM stage (P=0.042), gender (P=0.002) and
   age (P=0.022). The stability of circRNAs and the reproducibility of the
   qRT-PCR method for detecting circRNA levels were determined.
   CONCLUSION: These results suggested that circRNAs are highly stable in
   mammalian cells and that one specific circRNA, hsa_circ_002059, may be a
   potential novel and stable biomarker for the diagnosis of gastric
   carcinoma.

AB We have developed and fully validated a fast and simple LC-MS/MS assay
   to quantitate a therapeutic protein BMS-A in cynomolgus monkey serum.
   Prior to trypsin digestion, a recently reported sample pretreatment
   method was applied to remove more than 95% of the total serum albumin
   and denature the proteins in the serum sample. The pretreatment
   procedure simplified the biological sample prior to digestion, improved
   digestion efficiency and reproducibility, and did not require reduction
   and alkylation. The denatured proteins were then digested with trypsin
   at 60°C for 30min and the tryptic peptides were chromatographically
   separated on an Acquity CSH column (2.1mm*50mm, 1.7mum) using gradient
   elution. One surrogate peptide was used for quantitation and another
   surrogate peptide was selected for confirmation. Two corresponding
   stable isotope labeled peptides were used to compensate variations
   during LC-MS detection. The linear analytical range of the assay was
   0.50-500mug/mL. The accuracy (%Dev) was within ±5.4% and the total assay
   variation (%CV) was less than 12.0% for sample analysis. The validated
   method demonstrated good accuracy and precision and the application of
   the innovative albumin removal sample pretreatment method improved both
   assay sensitivity and robustness. The assay has been applied to a
   cynomolgus monkey toxicology study and the serum sample concentration
   data were in good agreement with data generated using a quantitative
   ligand-binding assay (LBA). The use of a confirmatory peptide, in
   addition to the quantitation peptide, ensured the integrity of the drug
   concentrations measured by the method.

AB Despite decades of creatinine measurement in biological fluids using a
   large variety of analytical methods, an accurate determination of this
   compound remains challenging. Especially with the novel trend to assess
   biomarkers on large sample sets preserved in biobanks, a simple and fast
   method that could cope with both a high sample throughput and a low
   volume of sample is still of interest. In answer to these challenges, a
   fast and accurate ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem
   mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method was developed to measure
   creatinine in small volumes of human urine. In this method, urine
   samples are simply diluted with a basic mobile phase and injected
   directly under positive electrospray ionization (ESI) conditions,
   without further purification steps. The combination of an important
   diluting factor (10(4) times) due to the use of a very sensitive triple
   quadrupole mass spectrometer (XEVO TQ) and the addition of creatinine-d3
   as internal standard completely eliminates matrix effects coming from
   the urine. The method was validated in-house in 2012 according to the
   EMA guideline on bioanalytical method validation using Certified
   Reference samples from the German External Quality Assessment Scheme
   (G-Equas) proficiency test. All obtained results for accuracy and
   recovery are within the authorized tolerance ranges defined by G-Equas.
   The method is linear between 0 and 5g/L, with LOD and LOQ of 5*10(-3)g/L
   and 10(-2)g/L, respectively. The repeatability (CVr=1.03-2.07%) and
   intra-laboratory reproducibility (CVRW=1.97-2.40%) satisfy the EMA 2012
   guideline. The validated method was firstly applied to perform the
   German G-Equas proficiency test rounds 51 and 53, in 2013 and 2014,
   respectively. The obtained results were again all within the accepted
   tolerance ranges and very close to the reference values defined by the
   organizers of the proficiency test scheme, demonstrating an excellent
   accuracy of the developed method. The method was finally applied to
   measure the creatinine concentration in 210 urine samples, coming from
   190 patients with a chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 20 healthy
   subjects. The obtained creatinine concentrations (ranging from 0.12g/L
   up to 3.84g/L) were compared, by means of a Passing Bablok regression,
   with the creatinine contents obtained for the same samples measured
   using a traditional compensated Jaffe method. The UHPLC-MS/MS method
   described in this paper can be used to normalize the concentration of
   biomarkers in urine for the extent of dilution.

AB For a round robin test for EN 1420-1 (Odour assessment for organic
   materials in contact with drinking water) with 14 contributing
   laboratories from 10 European countries segments of a plastic pipe were
   sent to the laboratories which performed a migration test and an odour
   analysis of the migration waters (water that had contact with the
   organic material) according to the procedure described in the standard
   from 1999. In addition reference substances (Methyl tert-butyl ether,
   1-butanol and hexanal) were investigated for their suitability to
   qualify the panels and the individual panellists. Methyl tert-butyl
   ether (MtBE) and 1-butanol proved to be suitable for this purpose,
   whereas hexanal showed a wide distribution of the individual odour
   threshold concentrations. Both possible testing options (unforced and
   forced choice) were performed and gave similar results. However, with
   respect to the qualification of the panellists and the data analysis the
   unforced choice procedure showed advantages. As human olfactory
   perception is used for the analysis, the reproducibility and the
   comparability between laboratories is of particular concern. For the
   pipe material the TON results of the different laboratories were in a
   range of ±1.5 dilutions based on a dilution factor of 2. This might be
   improved by taking the individual sensitivities of the panellists into
   account more strongly. Appropriate measures for the improvement of the
   test method appear to be the use of the proposed reference substances
   for the training of the panellists as well as the auditing and the
   selection of the panellists. The results of this round robin test are
   used in the revision process of the standard.

   result indicated that polysaccharides' structures and contents were

   from different producing areas, the A1245/A1328 ratio might be an

   addressed successfully (i.e., formulation, reproducibility, toxicity and
   quality assurance) in conjunction with the strong companies drive in the
   fast delivery of the new therapy to the patient. Four samples are under

   efficiency combined with minimum treatment duration and show the

   charged antibody-conjugated magnetic mesoporous Fe3O4 (Ab-Fe3O4) by
   electrostatic interaction to achieve encapsulation of toluidine blue
   (TB). With the addition of SCCA, APSM was replaced from Ab-Fe3O4 due to
   the specific binding of antibody to antigen, and then the trapped TB was
   released from the pores. The released TB could be detected by square
   wave voltammetry and the signal could be correlated with the amount of
   SCCA. The developed CRSHIP displayed a high current response, a
   relatively wide linear range (from 0.001 to 4.0 ng/mL) and a low
   detection limit (0.33 pg/mL) for the detection of SCCA. The method

   in interstitial fluid (ISF) is reported.
   The proposed transdermal biosensor makes use of an array of
   silicon-dioxide hollow microneedles that are about one order of
   magnitude both smaller (borehole down to 4 pm) and more densely-packed
   (up to 1 x 10(6) needles/cm(2)) than state-of-the-art microneedles used
   for biosensing so far. This allows self-powered (i.e. pump-free) uptake
   of ISF to be carried out with high efficacy and reliability in a few
   seconds (uptake rate up to 1 As) by exploiting capillarity in the
   microneedles. By coupling the microneedles operating under
   capillary-action with an enzymatic glucose biosensor integrated on the
   backside of the needle-chip, glucose measurements are performed with
   high accuracy ( +/- 20% of the actual glucose level for 96% of measures)
   and reproducibility (coefficient of variation 8.56%) in real-time (30 s)
   over the range 0-630 mg/dI, thus significantly improving
   microneedle-based biosensor performance with respect to the
   state-of-the-art. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A cascade signal amplification strategy through combining
   surface-initiated enzymatic polymerization (SIEP) and the subsequent
   deposition of strepavidin functionalized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs)
   was proposed. The first step of constructing the electrochemical
   immunosensor involves covalently immobilizing capture antibody on a
   chitosan modified glass carbon electrode, which then catalyzes DNA
   addition of deoxynucleotides (dNTP) at the 3'-OH group by terminal
   deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), leading to the formation of long
   single-stranded DNAs labeled with numerous biotins. Following the
   deposition of numerous strepavidin functionalized AgNPs on those long
   DNA chains, electrochemical stripping signal of silver was used to
   monitor the immunoreaction in KCl solution. Using a-fetoprotein as a
   model analyte, this amplification strategy could detect fetoprotein down
   to 0.046 pg/mL with a wide linear range from 0.1 pg/mL to 1.0 ng/mL. The
   achieved high sensitivity and good reproducibility suggest that this
   cascade signal amplification strategy has great potential for detecting
   biological samples and possibly clinical application. (C) 2014 Elsevier

AB An ultrasensitive photoelectrochemical (PEC) immunoassay based on signal
   amplification by enzyme mimetics was fabricated for the detection of
   mouse IgG (as a model protein). The PEC immunosensor was constructed by
   a layer-by-layer assembly of poly (diallyldimethylammonium chloride)
   (PDDA), CdS quantum dots (QDs), primary antibody (Ab(1), polyclonal goat
   antimouse IgG), and the antigen (Ag, mouse IgG) on an indium-tin oxide
   (ITO) electrode. Then, the secondary antibody (Ab(2), polyclonal goat
   antimouse IgG) combined to a bio-bar-coded Pt
   nanoparticle(NP)-G-quadruplex/hemin probe was used for signal
   amplification. The bio-bar-coded Pt NP-G-quadruplex/hemin probe could
   catalyze the oxidation of hydroquinone (HQ) using H2O2 as an oxidant,
   demonstrating its intrinsic enzyme-like activity. High sensitivity for
   the target Ag was achieved by using the bio-bar-coded probe as signal
   amplifier due to its high catalytic activity, a competitive
   nonproductive absorption of hemin and the steric hindrance caused by the
   polymeric oxidation products of HQ For most important, the oxidation
   product of HQ acted as an efficient electron acceptor of the illuminated
   CdS QDs. The target Ag could be detected from 0.01 pg/mL to 1.0 ng/mL
   with a low detection limit of 6.0 fg/mL. The as-obtained immunosensor
   exhibited high sensitivity, good stability and acceptable
   reproducibility. This method might be attractive for clinical and

   photo-patterning of two polymeric gels, polyacrylamide gel and
   polyethylene glycol (PEG) gel, on a glass slide. The resulting chip
   consists of 40 polyacrylamide gel pad array units for the immobilization
   of microbeads and each gel pad array is surrounded with a PEG
   micropillar ring to confine the samples within the microarray. As a
   proof of concept, this chip was tested for quantitative immunoassays for
   two model cancer markers, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and
   prostate specific antigen (PSA), in serum samples. Detection limits
   below the physiological threshold level for cancer diagnosis were
   achieved with good inter- and intra-chip reproducibility. Moreover, by
   using spatial encoded microbeads, simultaneous detection of both hCG and
   PSA on each gel pad array is achieved with single filter fluorescence
   imaging. This gel pad array chip is easy to use, easy to fabricate with
   low cost materials and minimal equipment and reusable. It could be a
   useful tool for common biolabs to customize their own microbead array
   for multi-analyte immunoassays. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Novel self-assembled dipeptide-gold nanoparticle (DP-AuNP) hybrid
   microspheres with a hollow structure have been prepared in aqueous
   solution by a simple one-step method. Diphenylalanine (FF) dipeptide was
   used as a precursor to form simultaneously peptide spheres and a
   reducing agent to reduce gold ions to gold nanoparticles in water at 60
   degrees C. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM) revealed that formed AuNPs were localized both inside
   and on the surface of the dipeptide spheres. Horseradish peroxidase
   (HRP) as a model enzyme was further immobilized on the dipeptide-AuNP
   hybrid spheres to construct a mediate H2O2 amperometric biosensor.
   UV-vis spectroscopy showed that the immobilized HRP retained its
   original structure. Cyclic voltammetry characterization demonstrated
   that the HRP/dipeptide-AuNP hybrid spheres modified glassy carbon
   electrode showed high electrocatalytic activity to H2O2. The proposed
   biosensor exhibited a wide linear response in the range from 5.0 x
   10(-7) to 9.7 x 10(-4) M with a high sensitivity of 28.3 mu A mM(-1). A
   low detection limit of 1.0 x 10(-7) M was estimated at S/N=3. In
   addition, the biosensor possessed satisfactory reproducibility and
   long-term stability. These results indicated that the dipeptide-AuNP
   hybrid sphere is a promising matrix for application in the fabrication
   of electrochemical biosensors due to its excellent biocompatibility and
   good charge-transfer ability. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB A highly sensitive immunoassay utilizing surface-enhanced Raman
   scattering (SERS) has been developed with a new Raman reporter and a
   unique SERS-active substrate incorporated into a microfluidic device. An
   appropriately designed Raman reporter, basic fuchsin (FC), gives strong
   SERS enhancement and has the ability to bind both the antibody and gold
   nanostructures. The fuchsin-labeled immuno-Au nanoflowers can form a
   sandwich structure with the antigen and the antibody immobilized on the
   SERS-active substrate based on Au-Ag coated GaN. Our experimental
   results indicate that this SERS-active substrate with its strong
   surface-enhancement factor, high stability and reproducibility plays a
   crucial role in improving the efficiency of SERS immunoassay. This SERS
   assay was applied to the detection of Hepatitis B virus antigen (HBsAg)
   in human blood plasma. A calibration curve was obtained by plotting the
   intensity of SERS signal of FC band at 1178 cm(-1) versus the
   concentration of antigen. The low detection limit for Hepatitis B virus
   antigen was estimated to be 0.01IU/mL. The average relative standard
   deviation (RSD) of this method is less than 10%. This SERS immunoassay
   gives exact results over a broad linear range, reflecting clinically
   relevant HBsAg concentrations. It also exhibits high biological
   specificity for the detection of Hepatitis B virus antigen (C) 2014

   NanoFe(3)O(4)@GO enabled all the ABEI immobilized molecules

   multifunctionalized GO attracted on the surface of magnetic glass carbon
   electrode through magnetism. Thus the ECL immunosensor could be prepared

AB A cascade signal amplification strategy through combining
   surface-initiated enzymatic polymerization (SIEP) and the subsequent
   deposition of strepavidin functionalized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs)
   was proposed. The first step of constructing the electrochemical
   immunosensor involves covalently immobilizing capture antibody on a
   chitosan modified glass carbon electrode, which then catalyzes DNA
   addition of deoxynucleotides (dNTP) at the 3'-OH group by terminal
   deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), leading to the formation of long
   single-stranded DNAs labeled with numerous biotins. Following the
   deposition of numerous strepavidin functionalized AgNPs on those long
   DNA chains, electrochemical stripping signal of silver was used to
   monitor the immunoreaction in KCl solution. Using alpha-fetoprotein as a
   model analyte, this amplification strategy could detect fetoprotein down
   to 0.046 pg/mL with a wide linear range from 0.1 pg/mL to 1.0 ng/mL. The
   achieved high sensitivity and good reproducibility suggest that this
   cascade signal amplification strategy has great potential for detecting
   biological samples and possibly clinical application. [All rights

AB An ultrasensitive photoelectrochemical (PEC) immunoassay based on signal
   amplification by enzyme mimetics was fabricated for the detection of
   mouse IgG (as a model protein). The PEC immunosensor was constructed by
   a layer-by-layer assembly of poly (diallyldimethylammonium chloride)
   (PDDA), CdS quantum dots (QDs), primary antibody (Ab 1, polyclonal goat
   antimouse IgG), and the antigen (Ag, mouse IgG) on an indium-tin oxide
   (ITO) electrode. Then, the secondary antibody (Ab 2, polyclonal goat
   antimouse IgG) combined to a bio-bar-coded Pt
   nanoparticle(NP)-G-quadruplex/hemin probe was used for signal
   amplification. The bio-bar-coded Pt NP-G-quadruplex/hemin probe could
   catalyze the oxidation of hydroquinone (HQ) using H 2O 2 as an oxidant,
   demonstrating its intrinsic enzyme-like activity. High sensitivity for
   the target Ag was achieved by using the bio-bar-coded probe as signal
   amplifier due to its high catalytic activity, a competitive
   nonproductive absorption of hemin and the steric hindrance caused by the
   polymeric oxidation products of HQ. For most important, the oxidation
   product of HQ acted as an efficient electron acceptor of the illuminated
   CdS QDs. The target Ag could be detected from 0.01 pg/mL to 1.0 ng/mL
   with a low detection limit of 6.0 fg/mL. The as-obtained immunosensor
   exhibited high sensitivity, good stability and acceptable
   reproducibility. This method might be attractive for clinical and
   biomedical applications. [All rights reserved Elsevier].

   signal. Based on this detection strategy, the biosensor showed high
   sensitivity with low detection limit of 0.15 ng/mL. Moreover, the

AB A novel controlled release system-based homogeneous immunoassay protocol
   (CRSHIP) was developed for the detection of squamous cell carcinoma
   antigen (SCCA). The positively charged aminated polystyrene microsphere
   (APSM) used as molecular gate was capped on the pores of the negatively
   charged antibody-conjugated magnetic mesoporous Fe 3O 4 (Ab-Fe 3O 4) by
   electrostatic interaction to achieve encapsulation of toluidine blue
   (TB). With the addition of SCCA, APSM was replaced from Ab-Fe 3O 4 due
   to the specific binding of antibody to antigen, and then the trapped TB
   was released from the pores. The released TB could be detected by square
   wave voltammetry and the signal could be correlated with the amount of
   SCCA. The developed CRSHIP displayed a high current response, a
   relatively wide linear range (from 0.001 to 4.0 ng/mL) and a low
   detection limit (0.33 pg/mL) for the detection of SCCA. The method
   showed high selectivity and good reproducibility. In addition, the
   CRSHIP provided a simple, fast and sensitive approach for the detection
   of SCCA in serum sample. [All rights reserved Elsevier].

   photo-patterning of two polymeric gels, polyacrylamide gel and
   polyethylene glycol (PEG) gel, on a glass slide. The resulting chip
   consists of 40 polyacrylamide gel pad array units for the immobilization
   of microbeads and each gel pad array is surrounded with a PEG
   micropillar ring to confine the samples within the microarray. As a
   proof of concept, this chip was tested for quantitative immunoassays for
   two model cancer markers, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and
   prostate specific antigen (PSA), in serum samples. Detection limits
   below the physiological threshold level for cancer diagnosis were
   achieved with good inter- and intra-chip reproducibility. Moreover, by
   using spatial encoded microbeads, simultaneous detection of both hCG and
   PSA on each gel pad array is achieved with single filter fluorescence
   imaging. This gel pad array chip is easy to use, easy to fabricate with
   low cost materials and minimal equipment and reusable. It could be a
   useful tool for common biolabs to customize their own microbead array
   for multi-analyte immunoassays. [All rights reserved Elsevier].

AB Novel self-assembled dipeptide-gold nanoparticle (DP-AuNP) hybrid
   microspheres with a hollow structure have been prepared in aqueous
   solution by a simple one-step method. Diphenylalanine (FF) dipeptide was
   used as a precursor to form simultaneously peptide spheres and a
   reducing agent to reduce gold ions to gold nanoparticles in water at 60
   degC. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM) revealed that formed AuNPs were localized both inside
   and on the surface of the dipeptide spheres. Horseradish peroxidase
   (HRP) as a model enzyme was further immobilized on the dipeptide-AuNP
   hybrid spheres to construct a mediate H 2O 2 amperometric biosensor.
   UV-vis spectroscopy showed that the immobilized HRP retained its
   original structure. Cyclic voltammetry characterization demonstrated
   that the HRP/dipeptide-AuNP hybrid spheres modified glassy carbon
   electrode showed high electrocatalytic activity to H 2O 2. The proposed
   biosensor exhibited a wide linear response in the range from 5.0times10
   -7 to 9.7times10 -4 M with a high sensitivity of 28.3 muA mM -1. A low
   detection limit of 1.0times10 -7 M was estimated at  S/N=3. In addition,
   the biosensor possessed satisfactory reproducibility and long-term
   stability. These results indicated that the dipeptide-AuNP hybrid sphere
   is a promising matrix for application in the fabrication of
   electrochemical biosensors due to its excellent biocompatibility and
   good charge-transfer ability. [All rights reserved Elsevier].

AB A one-step electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunosensor for
   ultrasensitive detection of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) was
   developed based on multi-functionalized graphene oxide (GO), which was
   prepared with N-(4-aminobutyl)-N-ethylisoluminol (ABEI) and CA19-9
   antibody (anti-CA19-9) chemically bound to the surface of magnetic GO
   (nanoFe 3O 4@GO). ABEI and anti-CA19-9 acted as the
   electrochemiluminophore and the capture device for CA19-9 respectively.
   NanoFe 3O 4@GO enabled all the ABEI immobilized molecules
   electrochemically active due to its good conductivity, and brought
   multi-functionalized GO attracted on the surface of magnetic glass
   carbon electrode through magnetism. Thus the ECL immunosensor could be
   prepared through a one-step process that facilitates ultrasensitive
   detection of CA19-9. Under optimal conditions, the ECL intensity of the
   immunosensor decreased proportionally to the logarithmic concentrations
   of CA19-9 in the range of 0.001-5 U/mL with a detection limit of 0.0005
   U/mL. This one-step ECL immunosensor showed good performance in
   specificity, stability, reproducibility, regeneration and application.
   It opened a new avenue to apply multi-functionalized bionanomaterials in

AB The validation of the AFM method for elastic modulus E measurement in

   in materials with E <5MPa is mainly biological, including soft tissues
   and single cells. For the diagnosis of malignant human tumors, a change
   in cell elasticity, within tissues, has recently been recognized as a
   marker of metastatic potential. To measure a cell elasticity difference,
   reproducible E measurements in biological samples are needed. In this
   work a robust method for a metrological validation of E measurements in
   the range 500-5000kPa was developed, based on the realization of thick E
   standard samples and on the study of the interactions between the
   measurement process and the sample at micro- and nano-scale. E
   measurement reproducibility limit of 4% has been reached. This allows
   designing a very sensitive and reproducible measurement of E in
   biological samples representing thus a powerful diagnostic tool for

AB One of the main activities in data-intensive science is data analysis.
   Although there are many popular technologies that can assist scientists
   in various isolated aspects of data analysis, supporting analysis
   processes in holistic ways that promote system interoperability,
   integration and automation, as well as scientific reproducibility and
   efficient data handling, presents many challenges. A common solution to
   address these challenges is to find efficient ways of integrating
   various existing technologies together to meet the analysis needs of
   scientists (which is similar to the idea behind science gateways). We
   believe that this solution is essentially an exercise in software
   design; and in many situations, these challenges should be tackled from
   a software design perspective. Consequently, this paper reviews
   different architectural design approaches that can be used to address
   these challenges and proposes a service-oriented framework called the Ad
   Hoc Data Grid Environment, which consists of an architectural pattern
   and its associated operational guidelines. The guidelines prescribe a
   number of activities based on an iterative decomposition approach to
   produce and evolve software architectures according to constantly
   changing user needs. The framework is demonstrated on a case study
   involving analysis processes required for conducting financial event
   studies. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB A simple and versatile method is described to construct high performance
   three-dimensional (3D) graphene-based enzyme biosensor. Monolithic and
   macroporous 3D graphene foam grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD)
   was used as a freestanding electrode for co-immobilization of
   horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and a commonly used redox mediator,
   methylene blue (MB). Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were employed as carriers
   of MB molecules to immobilize them on 3D graphene surface through strong
   pi-pi stacking force. Mussel-inspired biopolymer polydopamine (PDA) was
   formed by in-situ polymerization and served as a green linker, which
   could covalently graft HRP on the surface of 3D graphene/MB-CNTs
   electrode. In addition, PDA layer could also effectively prevent the
   leakage of inner electron mediators. Owing to the 3D macroporous
   architecture, exceptional properties of graphene and surface-bound
   mediators, the biosensor demonstrated outstanding performance for
   reagentless detection of H2O2 in terms of wide linear range (0.2 mu M to
   1.1 mM), high sensitivity (227.8 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2)), low detection
   limit (58.0 nM), and fast response (reaching 95% of the steady current
   within 3 s). The biosensor exhibited high reproducibility and stability.

AB Robust quantification of analytes is a prerequisite for meaningful
   metabolomics experiments. In non-targeted metabolomics it is still hard
   to compare measurements across multiple batches or instruments. For
   targeted analyses isotope dilution mass spectrometry is used to provide
   a robust normalization reference.
   Here, we present an approach that allows for the automated
   semi-quantification of metabolites relative to a fully stable
   isotope-labeled metabolite extract. Unlike many previous approaches, we
   include both identified and unidentified compounds in the data analysis.
   The internal standards are detected in an automated manner using the
   non-targeted tracer fate detection algorithm. The ratios of the light
   and heavy form of these compounds serve as a robust measure to compare
   metabolite levels across different mass spectrometric platforms. As
   opposed to other methods which require high resolution mass
   spectrometers, our methodology works with low resolution mass
   spectrometers as commonly used in gas chromatography electron impact
   mass spectrometry (GC-EI-MS)-based metabolomics.
   We demonstrate the validity of our method by analyzing compound levels
   in different samples and show that it outperforms conventional
   normalization approaches in terms of intra- and inter-instrument
   reproducibility. We show that a labeled yeast metabolite extract can
   also serve as a reference for mammalian metabolite extracts where
   complete stable isotope labeling is hard to achieve. (C) 2015 The

AB Serious bloodstream infections are a significant complication in
   critically ill patients. The treatment of these infections has become
   more difficult because of the increasing prevalence of multiresistant
   strains, especially methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
   Rapid differentiation of low number of MRSA from methicillin-susceptible
   S. aureus (MSSA) cells (10(1)-10(2) cells mL (1)) in blood is necessary
   for fast effective antibiotic therapy. Currently, three groups of
   techniques, phenotyping, genotyping, and mass spectrometry, are used for
   MRSA and MSSA strains differentiation. Most of these techniques are
   time-consuming. PCR and other molecular techniques allow the detection
   and differentiation between MSSA and MRSA directly from blood cultures.
   These methods alone are rapid and they have good reproducibility and
   repeatability. Potential disadvantages of the genotyping methods include
   their discrimination ability, technical complexity, financial costs, and
   difficult interpretation of the results.
   Recently, capillary electrophoresis (CZE) was successfully used to
   differentiate between the agar-cultivated MRSA and MSSA strains in fused
   silica capillaries etched with supercritical water and modified with
   (3-glycidyloxypropyl) trimethoxysilane. The possible use of CZE as a
   fast and low-cost method for distinguishing between the blood-incubated
   MRSA or MSSA cells has been tested in this manuscript. Our goal was to
   test low amounts of bacteria (similar to 10(2) cell mL (1)) similar to
   those in clinical samples. The migration times of the purified
   blood-incubated cells and the agar-cultivated cells were different from
   each other. However, their isoelectric point was the same for all
   strains. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   left ventricle (LV) quantification method, incorporating multislice
   image registration into the 3D model reconstruction, to improve
   reproducibility of 3D LV functional quantification. Multi-breath-hold
   short-axis and radial long-axis images were acquired from 10 patients
   and 10 healthy subjects. The proposed framework reduced misalignment
   between slices to subpixel accuracy (2.88 to 1.21mm), and improved
   interstudy reproducibility for 5 important clinical functional measures,
   i.e. end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, ejection fraction,
   myocardial mass and 3D-sphericity index, as reflected in a reduction in
   the sample size required to detect statistically significant cardiac
   changes: a reduction of 21-66%. Our investigation on the optimum
   registration parameters, including both cardiac time frames and number
   of long-axis (LA) slices, suggested that a single time frame is adequate
   for motion correction whereas integrating more LA slices can improve
   registration and model reconstruction accuracy for improved functional
   quantification especially on datasets with severe motion artefacts.

   (RSDs) for 13 replicate determination of 1.0 x 10(-6) L-thyroxine is
   1.1%. The proposed method was successfully applied for the determination

AB Due to the difficulties of working with chloramines, a critical
   examination of monochloramine standard preparation has been performed in
   order to select the best synthesis conditions. The analyte has been
   determined by in-tube solid phase extraction coupled to capillary liquid
   chromatography with UV detection (IT-SPME Capillary LC DAD). Potential
   factors affecting the response of monochloramine such as the pH of
   mobile phase and the volume of sample processed by IT-SPME Capillary LC
   DAD have been investigated and optimized. According to the results of
   the study, 0.1mL or 4.0mL of sample at neutral pH were loaded in the
   chromatographic system. A sensitive and selective method has been
   developed for the determination of monochloramine in water. Validation
   of the method has been performed. The linear range was 0.09-5mg/L with
   linear regression coefficients (R(2)) greater than 0.995. Method
   reproducibility expressed as relative standard deviation (RSD, %), was
   lower than 15%. The limits of detection (LODs) were 0.029 and 0.01mg/L
   by processing 0.100mL or 4mL of the samples, respectively, being below
   the maximum residues levels allowed for this compound. The sensitivity
   achieved by the developed method was better than that obtained by the
   reference method. The developed method was applied to water samples (tap
   and swimming pool water).

AB Molecular profiles of adhesion secretions of Gromphadorrhina portentosa
   (Madagascar hissing cockroach, Blattodea) were investigated by gas
   chromatography mass spectrometry with particular focus on a
   comprehensive analysis of linear and branched hydrocarbons. For this
   purpose, secretions from the tarsi (feet), possibly contributing to
   adhesion on smooth surfaces, and control samples taken from the tibiae
   (lower legs), which contain general cuticular hydrocarbons that are
   supposed to be not involved in the biological adhesion function, were
   analyzed and their molecular fingerprints compared. A major analytical
   difficulty in such a study constitutes the representative, spatially
   controlled, precise and reproducible sampling from a living insect as
   well as the minute quantities of insect secretions on both tarsi and
   tibiae. Thus, three different in vivo sampling methods were compared in
   terms of sampling reproducibility and extraction efficiency by replicate
   measurement of samples from tarsi and tibiae. While contact solid-phase
   microextraction (SPME) with a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) fiber showed
   higher peak intensities, a self-made uncoated glass fiber had the best
   repeatability in contact-SPME sampling. Chromatographic profiles of
   these two contact-SPME sampling methods were statistically not
   significantly different. Inter-individual variances were larger than
   potentially existing minor differences in molecular patterns of distinct
   sampling methods. Sampling by solvent extraction was time consuming,
   showed lower sensitivities and was less reproducible. In general,
   sampling by contact-SPME with a cheap glass fiber turned out to be a
   viable alternative to PDMS-SPME sampling. Hydrocarbon patterns of the
   tarsal adhesion secretions were qualitatively similar to those of
   epicuticular hydrocarbon profiles of the tibiae. However, hydrocarbons
   were in general less abundant in tarsal secretions than secretions from
   tibiae.

AB Capillary electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometry (CE/MS) is
   gaining its space among the most powerful tools in modern
   (bio)analytical laboratory. The most challenging instrumental aspect in
   CE/MS is striking the balance between the stability and reproducibility
   of the signal and sensitivity of the analysis. Several interface designs
   have been published in the past decade addressing the variety of
   instrumental aspects and ease of operation. Most of the interfaces can
   be categorized either into the sheath flow arrangement (considered to be
   a de facto standard), or sheathless interface, often expected to provide
   the ultimate sensitivity. In this work we have explored an
   "interface-free" approach, where the CE/MS analysis was performed in
   narrow bore (<20mum ID) electrospray capillary. The separation capillary
   and electrospray tip formed one entity and the high voltage, applied at
   the injection end of the capillary served for both the separation and
   electrospray ionization. Thus the separation voltage was defined as the
   product of the electrospray current and resistivity of the separation
   electrolyte. Optimum conditions for the separation and electrospray
   ionization were achieved with voltage programming. The performance of
   this simplest possible CE/MS system was tested on peptide separations
   from the cytochrome c tryptic digest. The subnanoliter sample
   consumption and sensitivity in the attomole range predetermines such a
   system for analysis of limited samples.

AB Three different molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) for quercetin were
   prepared with various combinations of functional monomers and porogens.
   First, the sorption capacities of investigated MIPs using frontal
   analyses were determined in different solvents. In order to asses the
   specificity of molecular recognition except of quercetin there was also
   employed another structurally related compound: rutin. In all cases it
   was observed that synthesized MIPs displayed the highest sorption
   capacities for the template in MeOH/H2O and in ACN for rutin. In the
   next step, the most optimal MIP (with 4-vinylpyridine as the functional
   monomer and acetone as the porogen) was chosen astheMISPE-sorbent to
   selective extraction of quercetin from the hop cone extract. Prepared
   polymeric material allowed the purification of sample with satisfactory
   capacity, selectivity to the template molecule, and a high
   reproducibility of results. LODs (S/N=5) were 0.3 mu g/mL for quercetin
   and 0.25 mu g/mL for rutin. LOQs (S/N=10) were 0.6 mu g/mL for quercetin
   and 0.5 mu g/mL for rutin.

   type and concentration of sugaring-out agent, the volume of
   acetonitrile, pH value, temperature, and vortex time were investigated.
   Separation was performed on a Diamonsil C-18 column (150x4.6mm i.d., 5
   mu M) with acetonitrile and 0.05% formic acid (60:40, v/v) as mobile
   phase. The column effluents were monitored at 254nm. The method showed
   good linearity for honokiol and magnolol in the range of 0.5-50.0 mu g
   center dot mL(-1), and the limits of detection were 13 and 24ng center
   dot mL(-1), respectively. RSD values for repeatability and
   reproducibility were less than 1.62% and 1.80%, respectively. The
   recoveries were in the range of 85.8-103.7%. Compared with the Chinese
   Pharmacopoeia method, the established method was simple, fast, and
   greatly reduced the consumption of toxic organic solvent. Statistical
   test showed that the analytical results for the determination of the
   same sample by the two methods had no significant difference.

AB To evaluate and validate the reproducibility of MR Elastography
   (MRE)-derived liver stiffness values on two different MR vendor

   This investigation was approved by the hospital IRB. MRE exams were

   clinical patients on two different 1.5 T MR scanners-once on a Philips
   MR scanner and immediately afterward in back-to-back fashion on a
   General Electric MR scanner, or vice versa. All scan parameters were
   kept identical on the two platforms to the best extent possible. After
   the MRE magnitude and phase images were obtained, the data were
   converted into quantitative images displaying the stiffness of the liver
   parenchyma. Mean liver stiffness values between the two platforms were
   compared using interclass correlation with a p value < 0.05 considered
   statistically significant.
   Interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) value of 0.994 was obtained for
   13 subjects with p value < 0.001 indicating a significantly positive
   correlation.
   As MRE gains in acceptance and as its availability becomes more
   widespread, it is important to ascertain and confirm that liver
   stiffness values obtained on different MRE vendor platforms are
   consistent and reproducible. In this small pilot investigation, we
   demonstrate that liver stiffness measurement with MRE is reproducible
   and has very good consistency across two vendor platforms.

AB Pediatric acquired aplastic anemia (AA) is a bone marrow disorder that
   is difficult to distinguish from inherited bone marrow failure syndromes
   and hypocellular refractory cytopenia of childhood (RCC). Historically,
   patients with hypocellular RCC have been given the diagnosis of AA. To
   assess the clinical and histologic distinction between RCC and AA, we
   performed a retrospective analysis of 149 patients previously diagnosed
   with AA between 1976 and 2010. We evaluated event free survival (EFS),
   overall survival (OS), response rates to immunosuppressive therapy,
   treatment-related toxicities and clonal evolution. The 5-year EFS and OS
   were 50.8%+/- 5.5% and 73.1%+/- 4.7%, respectively. Patients with very
   severe AA had worse OS compared to patients with severe and moderately
   severe AA. Seventy-two patients had diagnostic pathology specimens
   available for review. Three pediatric hematopathologists reviewed and
   reclassified these specimens as AA, RCC or Other based on 2008 WHO
   Criteria. The concordance between pathologists in the diagnosis of AA or
   RCC was modest. RCC was associated with a trend toward improved OS and
   EFS and was not prognostic of immunosuppression therapy treatment
   failure. There was a low rate of clonal evolution exclusively associated
   with moderately severe AA. Our findings indicate that a diagnosis of RCC
   is difficult to establish with certainty and does not predict outcomes,
   calling into question the reproducibility and clinical significance of
   the RCC classification and warranting further studies. Am. J. Hematol.

AB PURPOSE: To measure average retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thicknesses
   in healthy, full-term neonates.
   DESIGN: Descriptive research to develop normative data.
   METHODS: Healthy infants born between 37 and 42 weeks postmenstrual age
   were imaged with hand-held spectral-domain optical coherence tomography.
   A custom script segmented the RNFL; the fovea and optic nerve center
   were manually selected. A second script measured the average RNFL
   thickness along the papillo-macular bundle, defined as the arc from -15
   degrees to + 15 degrees on the axis from the optic nerve to fovea, with
   radii of 1.1, 1.3, 1.5, and 1.7 mm from the center of the optic disc.
   Shapiro-Wilk W tests assessed these measurements for normality to
   determine the age-appropriate radial distance for subsequent analyses.
   Average RNFL thicknesses for four temporal 45-degree sectors (superior
   temporal, temporal superior, temporal inferior, and inferior temporal)
   and the temporal quadrant were calculated and compared to demographic
   parameters for all infants.
   RESULTS: Fifty full-term infants were adequately imaged for RNFL
   analysis. RNFL thicknesses at 1.5 mm radial distance from the optic
   nerve were the most normally distributed. While there was a trend toward
   greater mean superior temporal RNFL thickness for both black and
   Hispanic vs white infants (128 +/- 27 mu m, 124 +/- 30 mu m, and 100 +/-
   19 mu m, respectively, P = .04 for both comparisons), there were no
   other significant differences noted in RNFL thicknesses by race, sex,
   gestational age, or birth weight.
   CONCLUSIONS: We present RNFL thickness measurements for healthy,
   full-term infants that may serve as normative data for future analyses.

   (F-18-FDG) uptake on F-18-FDG positron emission tomography (PET)/CT and
   F-18-FDG PET/MR scans in patients with head and neck squamous cell
   carcinoma (HNSCC).
   Methods: 30 patients with HNSCC were included in this prospective study.
   The patients were scanned twice before radiotherapy treatment with both
   PET/CT and PET/MR. Patients were scanned on the same scanners, 3 days
   apart and according to the same protocol. Metabolic tumour activity was
   measured by the maximum and peak standardized uptake value (SUVmax and
   SUVpeak, respectively), and total lesion glycolysis from the metabolic
   tumour volume defined from >= 50% SUVmax. Bland-Altman analysis with
   limits of agreement, coefficient of variation (CV) from the two
   modalities were performed in order to test the reproducibility.
   Furthermore, CVs from SUVmax and SUVpeak were compared. The area under
   the curve from cumulative SUV-volume histograms were measured and tested
   for reproducibility of the distribution of F-18-FDG uptake.
   Results: 24 patients had two pre-treatment PET/CT scans and 21 patients
   had two pre-treatment PET/MR scans available for further analyses. Mean
   difference for SUVmax, peak and mean was approximately 4% for PET/CT and
   3% for PET/MR, with 95% limits of agreement less than +/- 20%. CV was
   small (5-7%) for both modalities. There was no significant difference in
   CVs between PET/CT and PET/MR (p = 0.31). SUVmax was not more
   reproducible than SUVpeak (p = 0.09).
   Conclusion: F-18-FDG uptake in PET/CT and PET/MR is highly reproducible
   and we found no difference in reproducibility between PET/CT and PET/MR.
   Advances in knowledge: This is the first report to test reproducibility
   of PET/CT and PET/MR.

AB fMRI is increasingly implemented in the clinic to assess memory
   function. There are multiple approaches to memory fMRI, but limited data
   on advantages and reliability of different methods. Here, we compared
   effect size, activation lateralisation, and between-sessions reliability
   of seven memory fMRI protocols: Hometown Walking (block design), Scene
   encoding (block design and event-related design), Picture encoding
   (block and event-related), and Word encoding (block and event-related).
   All protocols were performed on three occasions in 16 patients with
   temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Group T-maps showed activity bilaterally
   in medial temporal lobe for all protocols. Using ANOVA, there was an
   interaction between hemisphere and seizure-onset lateralisation
   (P=0.009) and between hemisphere, protocol and seizure-onset
   lateralisation (P=0.002), showing that the distribution of
   memory-related activity between left and right temporal lobes differed
   between protocols and between patients with left-onset and right-onset
   seizures. Using voxelwise intraclass Correlation Coefficient,
   between-sessions reliability was best for Hometown and Scenes (block and
   event). The between-sessions spatial overlap of activated voxels was
   also greatest for Hometown and Scenes. Lateralisation of activity
   between hemispheres was most reliable for Scenes (block and event) and
   Words (event). Using receiver operating characteristic analysis to
   explore the ability of each fMRI protocol to classify patients as
   left-onset or right-onset TLE, only the Words (event) protocol achieved
   a significantly above-chance classification of patients at all three
   sessions. We conclude that Words (event) protocol shows the best
   combination of between-sessions reliability of the distribution of
   activity between hemispheres and reliable ability to distinguish between
   left-onset and right-onset patients. Hum Brain Mapp 36:1595-1608, 2015.

AB Purpose: To compare the extent of tumor motion between 4-dimensional CT
   (4DCT) and cine-MRI in patients with hepatic tumors treated with
   radiation therapy.
   Methods and Materials: Patients with liver tumors who underwent 4DCT and
   2-dimensional biplanar cine-MRI scans during simulation were
   retrospectively reviewed to determine the extent of target motion in the
   superior-inferior, anteriore-posterior, and lateral directions. Cine-MRI
   was performed over 5 minutes. Tumor motion from MRI was determined by
   tracking the centroid of the gross tumor volume using deformable image
   registration. Motion estimates from 4DCT were performed by evaluation of
   the fiducial, residual contrast (or liver contour) positions in each CT
   phase.
   Results: Sixteen patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (n=11),
   cholangiocarcinoma (n=3), and liver metastasis (n=2) were reviewed.
   Cine-MRI motion was larger than 4DCT for the superior-inferior direction
   in 50% of patients by a median of 3.0 mm (range, 1.5-7 mm), the
   anterior-posterior direction in 44% of patients by a median of 2.5 mm
   (range, 1-5.5 mm), and laterally in 63% of patients by a median of 1.1
   mm (range, 0.2-4.5 mm).
   Conclusions: Cine-MRI frequently detects larger differences in hepatic
   intrafraction tumor motion when compared with 4DCT most notably in the
   superior-inferior direction, and may be useful when assessing the need
   for or treating without respiratory management, particularly in patients
   with unreliable 4DCT imaging. Margins wider than the internal target
   volume as defined by 4DCT were required to encompass nearly all the
   motion detected by cine-MRI for some of the patients in this study. (C)

   Objective To determine the reproducibility and intermethod reliability
   of a youth calcium food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) in a
   multiracial/ethnic sample of children and adolescents.
   Design Reproducibility (n=69) and intermethod reliability (n=393)
   studies were conducted by administering repeat FFQs and three
   unannounced 24-hour dietary recalls to stratified random samples of
   individuals participating in the Bone Mineral Density in Childhood
   Study.
   Participants/setting Children and adolescents ages 5 to 21 years. Main
   outcome measures Calcium intake estimated from the FFQ and 24-hour
   dietary recalls.
   Statistical analysis Reproducibility was assessed by the intraclass
   correlation coefficient (ICC). Intermethod reliability was assessed by
   deattenuated Pearson correlations between the FFQ and 24-hour recalls.
   Attenuation factors and calibration corrected effect estimates for bone
   density were calculated to determine the potential influence of
   measurement error on associations with health outcomes.
   Results The ICC (0.61) for repeat administrations and deattenuated
   Pearson correlation between the FFQ and 24-hour recalls (r=0.60) for all
   subjects indicated reproducibility and intermethod reliability (Pearson
   r=0.50 to 0.74 across sex and age groups). Attenuation factors were <=
   0.50 for all sex and age groups and lower for non-Hispanic blacks
   (lambda=0.20) and Hispanics (lambda=0.26) than for non-Hispanic whites
   (lambda=0.42).
   Conclusions The Bone Mineral Density in Childhood Study calcium FFQ
   appears to provide a useful tool for assessing calcium intake in
   children and adolescents drawn from multiracial/ethnic populations
   and/or spanning a wide age range. However, similar to other FFQs,
   attenuation factors were substantially <1, indicating the potential for
   appreciable measurement error bias. Calibration correction should be
   performed and racial/ethnic differences in performance considered when
   analyzing and interpreting findings based on this instrument.

AB Background Dietary patterns provide insight into relationships between
   diet and disease. Food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) can identify
   dietary patterns in adults, but similar analyses have not been performed
   for toddlers.
   Objective The aim of the Eating Assessment in Toddlers study was to
   evaluate the relative validity and reproducibility of dietary patterns
   from an FFQ developed for toddlers aged 12 to 24 months.
   Design/setting Participants were 160 toddlers aged 12 to 24 months and
   their primary caregiver who completed an FFQ twice, approximately 5
   weeks apart (FFQ1 and FFQ2). A 5-day weighed food record was collected
   on nonconsecutive days between FFQ administrations.
   Statistical analysis Principal component analysis identified three major
   dietary patterns similar across FFQ1, FFQ2, and the 5-day weighted food
   record.
   Results The sweet foods and fries pattern was characterized by high
   intakes of sweet foods, fries and roast potato and kumara (sweet
   potato), butter and margarines, processed meat, sweet drinks, and fruit
   or milk drinks. The vegetables and meat pattern was characterized by
   high intakes of vegetables, meat, eggs and beans, and fruit. The milk
   and fruit pattern was characterized by high intakes of milk and milk
   products and fruit, and low intakes of breastmilk and infant and
   follow-up formula. The FFQ (FFQ1) correctly classified 43.1% to 51.0% of
   toddlers into the same quartile of pattern score as the 5-day weighted
   food record, and Pearson correlations ranged from 0.56 to 0.68 for the
   three patterns. Reliability coefficients ranged from 0.71 to 0.72 for
   all three dietary patterns.
   Conclusions the Eating Assessment in Toddlers study FFQ shows acceptable
   relative validity and high reproducibility for identifying dietary
   patterns in toddlers.

AB Background: A novel classification of pulmonary adenocarcinoma (ADC)
   distinguishing five growth patterns has been established by the
   International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer/American Thoracic
   Society/European Respiratory Society. There is evidence that an
   additional cribriform pattern associates with a distinct clinical
   behavior.
   Methods: We evaluated the predominant growth pattern of 674 resected ADC
   as recommended by the International Association for the Study of Lung
   Cancer/American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society, including
   the cribriform pattern. The predominant pattern type was correlated with
   clinical, molecular, and survival data.
   Results: Two hundred forty-eight (36.8%) of the pulmonary ADC were
   solid, 207 (30.6%) were acinar, 101 (15%) were papillary, 55 (8.2%) were
   micropapillary, 35 (5.2%) were lepidic, and 28 cases (4.2%) were
   cribriform predominant (cpADC). Minor cribriform components were
   frequently observed (28.6% of all cases). cpADC showed the second
   highest proliferative capacity of all patterns, no somatic mutations in
   the epidermal growth factor receptor (p = 0.001) and a high rate of KRAS
   mutations. Overall survival (OS) of patients with cpADC (mean OS: 62.7
   months) ranged in between survival times of patients with acinar (mean
   OS: 71.3 months) and solid predominant ADC (mean OS: 54.5 months); cpADC
   was associated with the worst disease-free survival (DFS) of all
   patterns (mean DFS: 36.9 months). Both associations were confirmed by
   multivariate analysis (p < 0.01 for both OS and DFS). Hazard ratios for
   cpADC were 1.72 for OS and 2.99 for DFS, with lepidic predominant ADC
   set as reference (hazard ratio: 1).
   Conclusions: Our data support the introduction of cpADC as a novel
   category into future morphology based on pulmonary ADC classifications.
   Further international studies are required to validate the reported
   clinicopathological associations of the cribriform pattern.

AB Introduction: We investigated whether a group of pathologists could
   reproducibly apply the International Association for the Study of Lung
   Cancer/American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society
   (IASLC/ATS/ERS) classification for lung adenocarcinoma to a cohort of
   stage 1 tumors and whether this architectural classification and/or
   other parameters could demonstrate survival advantage.
   Methods: A total of 145 cases of 7th edition of tumor, node, metastasis
   stage 1 adenocarcinoma were retrospectively reviewed for predominant
   architectural pattern, including cribriform pattern, nuclear grade,
   mitotic index, and necrosis. The parameters were assessed for
   reproducibility and survival and using multivariate analysis, compared
   with stage, age, and sex.
   Results: The majority of tumors had a mixed architecture with the acinar
   pattern being the most common predominant architecture. Micropapillary
   and cribriform architecture were the least frequent patterns. This study
   demonstrated that a group of five pathologists could reproducibly apply
   the IASLC/ATS/ERS classification. Although there were insufficient
   cribriform-predominant adenocarcinomas for assessment, when the
   percentage of all cribriform was combined with other architectures, it
   was associated with a worse prognosis. The majority of the parameters
   assessed demonstrated significance with univariate analysis but only
   mitotic index, as assessed by the highest count/10 high-power fields
   remained significant with multivariate analysis.
   Conclusion: In this study of resected stage 1 primary lung
   adenocarcinoma, we found mitotic index to be the only independent
   prognostic marker. It was more closely associated with outcome than
   either pathologic T stage or IASLC/ATS/ERS architecture-based
   classification. Further validation of concordance and reproducibility in
   reporting mitotic index, as well as validation of prognostic
   significance, needs to be undertaken in independent data sets.

TI Modified Masaoka Stage and Size Are Independent Prognostic Predictors in

AB Introduction: The prognostic value of histopathologic classifications of
   thymoma is debated. Problematic reproducibility might cause this
   controversy. We studied the prognostic significance of three
   histopathologic classifications of thymomas after three thoracic
   pathologists agreed upon thymoma subtype and invasion. We also compared
   the outcome to established prognostic parameters.
   Methods: Patients, surgically treated for thymic epithelial neoplasm at
   Mayo Clinic (1942-2008), were staged according to the modified Masaoka
   staging and the recently proposed staging by Moran. Three thoracic
   pathologists independently classified all cases according to the World
   Health Organization, Bernatz, and proposed Suster and Moran
   classification. Only thymoma that all three pathologists diagnosed as
   the same histopathologic subtype and extent of invasion were included in
   outcome analysis.
   Results: In 214 (proposed Suster and Moran classification), 145 (World
   Health Organization classification), and 120 cases (Bernatz
   classification), reviewers agreed upon subtype of thymoma and invasion
   and follow-up was available. Median follow-up time was 7.5-7.7 years
   (range between classifications). All histopathologic classifications
   were associated with overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (p
   = 0.0001 to p = 0.048); only Bernatz classification was independent of
   modified Masaoka staging associated with OS (p = 0.04). Modified Masaoka
   stage predicted outcome independent of all histopathologic
   classifications and resection status and strongly correlated with the
   proposed Moran stage (correlation coefficient, 0.95). Thymoma size and
   age were prognostic parameters for OS independent of any histopathologic
   classification.
   Conclusions: Histopathologic classifications of thymomas are associated
   with prognosis but are in general not independent predictors of outcome.
   Modified Masaoka stage and proposed Moran staging are independent
   prognostic parameters for thymoma and superior to histopathologic
   classifications.

AB Background and aims: South Asians have a higher risk of developing
   cardiovascular disease than white Caucasians. The underlying cause is
   unknown, but might be related to higher cardiac susceptibility to
   metabolic disorders. Short-term caloric restriction (CR) can be used as
   a metabolic stress test to study cardiac flexibility. We assessed
   whether metabolic and functional cardiovascular flexibility to CR
   differs between South Asians and white Caucasians.
   Methods and results: Cardiovascular function and myocardial
   triglycerides were assessed using a 1.5T-MRI/S-scanner in 12 middle-aged
   overweight male South Asians and 12 matched white Caucasians before and
   after an 8-day very low calorie diet (VLCD). At baseline South Asians
   were more insulin resistant than Caucasians. Cardiac dimensions were
   smaller, despite correction for body surface area, and pulse wave
   velocity (PWV) in the distal aorta was higher in South Asians. Systolic
   and diastolic function, myocardial triglycerides and pericardial fat did
   not differ significantly between groups. After the VLCD body weight
   reduced on average by 4.0 +/- 0.2 kg. Myocardial triglycerides increased
   in both ethnicities by 69 +/- 18%, and diastolic function decreased
   although this was not significant in South Asians. However, pericardial
   fat and PWV in the proximal and total aorta were reduced in Caucasians
   only.
   Conclusion: Myocardial triglyceride stores in middle-aged overweight and
   insulin resistant South Asians are as flexible and amenable to
   therapeutic intervention by CR as age-, sex- and BMI-matched but less
   insulin resistant white Caucasians. However, paracardial fat volume and
   PWV showed a differential effect in response to an 8-day VLCD in favor
   of Caucasians. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The applications of carbon nanotube (CNT) as solid-phase extraction
   matrix and bulk modification material in electrochemiluminescence (ECL)
   have been demonstrated for the first time. The bulk modification of
   Ru(phen) (2+)(3) has been achieved through the preparation of Ru(phen)
   (2+)(3)/Nafion modified CNT ceramic electrode. The bulk modification
   method has the advantages of easy electrode surface renewal and facile
   electrode preparation over surface immobilization approaches. Moreover,
   Ru(phen)(3)(2+)/Nafion modified CNT ceramic electrode can serve as an
   excellent solid- phase microextraction matrix because of the presence of
   CNT in the electrode. The combination of the Ru(phen)(3)(2+)/Nafion
   modified CNT ceramic electrode with solid-phase extraction enables
   ultrasensitive detection of perphenazine. The log-log calibration plot
   for perphenazine is linear from 1 x 10(-6) to 1 x 10(-11) M with a
   detection limit of 5.8 x 10(-12) M. The Ru(phen)(3)(2+)/Nafion modified
   CNT ceramic electrode shows better detection limit than
   Ru(phen)(3)(2+)/Nafion modified graphite ceramic electrode by about two
   orders of magnitude because of strong adsorption capacity and large
   adsorbing area of multi-walled CNT as well as low ECL background. It is
   one of the most sensitive methods for the Ru(phen)(3)(2+) ECL
   determination of coreactants so far. The detection takes less than 3
   min, which makes this method promising for on-site detection. This
   method was also successfully applied for the determination of
   perphenazine in human urine samples spiked with perphenazine. The
   Ru(phen)(3)(2+)/Nafion modified CNT ceramic electrode exhibits
   outstanding long-term stability and reproducibility. The remarkable
   extraction capability and outstanding long-term stability of
   Ru(phen)(3)(2+)/Nafion modified CNT ceramic electrode as well as the
   advantages of bulk modification method make the present detection
   strategy promising for ultrasensitive detection of organic compounds.

   glucose is carried out at 0.52 V (versus Ag/AgCl). The amperometric
   signals are linearly proportional to glucose concentration from 3 mu M

   waveguide resonator was coated with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) polymer
   and used as a humidity probe. A dielectric change in the PVP due to a
   change in the ambient humidity introduces a fast phase shift in the
   probe, which causes a frequency shift in the MSW oscillator. The
   humidity sensing behavior of this device was investigated at room
   temperature over a range of 12.595% relative humidity (RH). Furthermore,
   the device was used to monitor human breath as a non-invasive sensor,
   showing great adaptability and ease of use in a real application. In
   conclusion, the sensor exhibited reproducibility, accuracy, high

AB The use of porous silicon (PS) as an electrochemical biosensor has been
   reviewed. For electrochemical biosensing, the enhanced surface area is
   not the only advantage of using PS. In fact, depending on the
   transduction mechanisms, various issues like modulation of electric
   field lines through the pores and its interface with the biomolecules
   and ions of the analytes, nature of PS-metal contacts, orientation of
   the molecules within the pores and modification of the effective spring
   constant of the structure leading to a change in the resonant frequency
   have significant impact on sensitivity, reproducibility and longevity.
   In this review, we provide a critical assessment of the various factors
   which are actually responsible for enhanced performance of PS
   electrochemical biosensors. Formation procedures of PS for
   electrochemical biosensing have been mentioned. The mechanism of surface
   modification and derivatization has been briefly discussed. The contact
   formation techniques have been outlined. Four different categories of
   electrochemical biosensors using PS have been analysed in details with
   emphasis on equivalent circuit models and the specific role of PS in the
   electrical transduction mechanisms. Finally the existing challenges and
   the future prospects of such devices for commercial use are highlighted.

   The developed green synthesis approach successfully eradicates issues

   analysis showed a wide linear range up to 5 mM and sensitivity
   improvements of more than 22 times in comparison to the control sample.
   Subsequently, an electrochemical glucose biosensor was fabricated by the
   immobilization of glucose oxidase (GOx) via bi-functional linkers. This

   bonding between graphene and the enzymatic amide groups, while
   preserving the sp(2) graphene structure, whilst promoting better

AB Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship
   of postural stability and lower extremity performance with core
   stability, knee laxity, and muscle strength in patients with anterior
   cruciate ligament reconstruction.
   Design Twenty-eight anterior cruciate ligament-reconstructed subjects
   were included in the study. Anterior knee laxity tests, isokinetic knee
   muscle strength tests, and core stability tests were performed.
   Single-limb postural stability was assessed in both eyes-open and
   eyes-closed positions on a static surface and an eyes-open condition on
   a foam surface. A single-legged hop test was performed to assess lower
   extremity performance. To detect differences between the operated and
   healthy leg, a Mann-Whitney U test was performed, and a correlation
   analysis was performed using the Spearman correlation coefficient.
   Results Knee muscle strength and laxity were different between the
   operated and healthy legs (P < 0.05). Postural stability scores
   correlated with core stability tests (P < 0.05) in both the operated and
   healthy legs. In the operated leg, knee laxity and muscle strength
   correlated with the mediolateral sway index on a foam surface (P <
   0.05). Knee flexor and extensor muscle strength correlated with the
   single-legged hop for both legs (P < 0.05).
   Conclusions Decreased core stability, decreased knee muscle strength,
   and increased knee laxity correlated with single-limb postural
   stability. Better hop performance was demonstrated with better knee
   flexor and extensor muscle strength and was independent from core
   stability.

AB Infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV) causes
   mortality or runt deformity syndrome in penaeid shrimps and is
   responsible for significant economic losses in the shrimp aquaculture
   industry. Here, we describe a novel real-time isothermal recombinase
   polymerase amplification (RPA) assay developed for IHHNV detection.
   Using IHHNV plasmid standards and DNA samples from a variety of
   organisms, we evaluated the ability of the IHHNV-RPA assay to detect
   IHHNV based on analysis of its sensitivity, specificity, rapidity, and
   reproducibility. Probit analysis of eight independent experimental
   replicates indicated satisfactory performance of the RPA assay, which is
   sufficiently sensitive to detect as few as 4 copies of the IHHNV genome
   within 7 min at 39 degrees C with 95 % reliability. Therefore, this
   rapid RPA method has great potential for applications, either in field
   use or as a point of care diagnostic technique.

AB This study aims to evaluate the intraobserver and interobserver

   erosion score measurements in patients with gout by using dual-energy CT
   (DECT) scans comparing their bone erosion volumes against bone erosion
   scores and also to determine a valid measure of joint destruction in
   chronic gout. Sixty-six subjects underwent DECT scans of the hands or
   feet. Two independent observers measured the tophus urate volumes and
   bone erosion volumes using automated volume assessment software and the
   erosion scores based on the rheumatoid arthritis magnetic resonance
   imaging score (RAMRIS). The intraobserver and interobserver
   reproducibility were analyzed by intraclass correlation coefficient
   (ICC) and limits of agreements analysis. The relationship between
   erosion volumes and erosion scores was analyzed. The intraobserver and
   interobserver ICC for tophus urate volume measurements (n = 636) were
   1.000 (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1.000 to 1.000) and 1.000 (95
   % CI 1.000 to 1.000), 0.999 (0.999, 0.999) and 0.999 (0.999, 0.999) for
   bone erosion volumes (n = 350), 0.937 (0.928, 0.946) and 0.899 (0.883,
   0.912) for erosion scores (n = 350). Strong positive correlations were
   demonstrated between individual erosion volumes and scores (r (s) =
   0.914, p < 0.001) as well as total erosion volume and score per patient
   (r = 0.838-0.867, p < 0.001). This study demonstrated a high
   reproducibility of tophus urate volumes, erosion volumes, and erosion
   score measurements using DECT. Erosion volumes show to be a more direct
   and accurate method to evaluate bone erosion compared with erosion
   score, strongly supporting it as a superior and standard measure of
   structural joint damage in gout.

AB In the nearly 100 years since the discovery of therapeutic insulin,
   significant research efforts have been directed at finding the
   underlying cause of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and developing a cure for the
   disease. While progress has clearly been made toward each of these
   goals, neither vision has been fulfilled. With increasing pressure from
   both public and private funders of diabetes research, growing impatience
   of those with T1D at the lack of practical discoveries, increased
   competition for research funds, uncertainties on the reproducibility of
   published scientific data, and questions regarding the value of animal
   models, the current research environment has become extraordinarily
   difficult to traverse from the perspective of investigators. As a
   result, there is an increasing pressure toward performance of what might
   be considered safe research, where the aim is to affirm existing dogmas
   rather than to pioneer efforts involving unconventional thought.
   Psychologists refer to this practice as observational bias while
   cartoonists label the process the streetlight effect. In this
   Perspective, we consider notions in T1D research that should be subject
   to bold question and provide additional concepts, many somewhat orphan
   to research efforts, whose investigation could lead to a means for truly
   identifying the cause of and a cure for T1D.

AB PurposeTo develop a registration-based autofocusing (RAF) motion
   correction technique for high-resolution trabecular bone (TB) imaging
   and to evaluate its performance on in vivo MR data.
   Materials and MethodsThe technique combines serial registration with a
   previously developed motion correction technique autofocusing for
   automatic correction of subject movement degradation of MR images
   acquired in longitudinal studies. The method was tested on in vivo
   images of the distal radius to measure improvements in serial
   reproducibility of parameters in 12 women (ages 50-75 years), and to
   compare with the navigator echo-based correction and autofocusing.
   Furthermore, the technique's ability to optimize the sensitivity to
   detect simulated bone loss was ascertained.
   ResultsThe new technique yielded superior reproducibility of
   image-derived structural and mechanical parameters. Average coefficient
   of variation across all parameters improved by 12.5%, 27.0%, 33.5%, and
   37.0%, respectively, following correction by navigator echoes,
   autofocusing, and the RAF technique (without and with correction for
   rotational motion); average intra-class correlation coefficient
   increased by 1.2%, 2.2%, 2.8%, and 3.2%, respectively. Furthermore,
   simulated bone loss (5%) was well recovered independent of the choice of
   reference image (4.71% or 4.86% with respect to using either the
   original or the image subjected to bone loss) in the time series.
   ConclusionThe data suggest that our technique simultaneously corrects
   for intra-scan motion corruption while improving inter-scan
   registration. Furthermore, the technique is not biased by small changes
   in bone architecture between time-points. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging

AB PurposeTo compare cardiovascular magnetic resonance-feature tracking

   for the calculation of short and long axis Lagrangian strain measures in
   systole and diastole.
   Materials and MethodsHealthy controls (n = 35) and patients with dilated
   cardiomyopathy (n = 10) were identified prospectively and underwent
   steady-state free precession (SSFP) cine imaging and SPAMM imaging using
   a gradient-echo sequence. A timed offline analysis of images acquired at
   identical horizontal long and short axis slice positions was performed
   using CMR-FT and dynamic tissue-tagging (CIMTag2D). Agreement between
   strain and strain rate (SR) values calculated using these two different
   methods was assessed using the Bland-Altman technique.
   ResultsAcross all participants, there was good agreement between CMR-FT
   and CIMTag for calculation of peak systolic global circumferential
   strain (-22.7 6.2% vs. -22.5 +/- 6.9%, bias 0.2 +/- 4.0%) and SR (-1.35
   +/- 0.42 1/s vs. -1.22 +/- 0.42 1/s, bias 0.13 +/- 0.33 1/s) and early
   diastolic global circumferential SR (1.21 +/- 0.44 1/s vs. 1.07 +/- 0.30
   1/s, bias -0.14 +/- 0.34 1/s) at the subendocardium. There was
   satisfactory agreement for derivation of peak systolic global
   longitudinal strain (-18.1 +/- 5.0% vs. -16.7 +/- 4.8%, bias 1.3 +/-
   3.8%) and SR (-1.04 +/- 0.29 1/s vs. -0.95 +/- 0.32 1/s, bias 0.09 +/-
   0.26 1/s). The weakest agreement was for early diastolic global
   longitudinal SR (1.10 +/- 0.40 1/s vs. 0.67 +/- 0.32 1/s, bias -0.42 +/-
   0.40 1/s), although the correlation remained significant (r = 0.42, P <
   0.01). CMR-FT generated these data over four times quicker than CIMTag.
   ConclusionThere is sufficient agreement between systolic and diastolic
   strain measures calculated using CMR-FT and myocardial tagging for
   CMR-FT to be considered as a potentially feasible and rapid alternative.

AB PurposeTo determine normative values for left ventricular (LV) volumes,

   associations between sex, age, and body size with LV parameters in
   community-dwelling adults.
   Materials and MethodsIn all, 1794 Framingham Heart Study Offspring
   cohort members underwent LV short-axis oriented, contiguous multislice
   cine steady-state free precession MR of the left ventricle; from these a
   healthy referent group (n=852, 619 years, 40% men) free of clinical
   cardiac disease and hypertension (SBP<140, DBP<90 mmHg, never used
   antihypertensive medication 30 years prior to scanning) was identified.
   Referent participants were stratified by sex and age group (55, 56-65,
   >65 years); LV parameters were indexed to measures of body size.
   ResultsMen have greater LV volumes and mass than women both before and
   after indexation to height, powers of height, and body surface area
   (P<0.01 all), but indexation to fat-free mass yielded greater LV volume
   and mass in women. In both sexes, LV volumes and mass decrease with
   advancing age, although indexation attenuates this association. LVEF is
   greater in women than men (68 +/- 5% vs. 66 +/- 5%, P<0.01) and
   increases with age in both sexes (P<0.05).
   ConclusionAmong nonhypertensive adults free of cardiac disease, men have
   greater LV volumes and mass with sex differences generally persisting
   after indexation to body size. LV volumes and mass tend to decrease with
   greater age in both sexes. Female sex and advanced age were both
   associated with greater LVEF. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2015;41:1038-1045.

AB PurposeTo determine the interstudy reproducibility of myocardial strain
   and peak early-diastolic strain rate (PEDSR) measurement on
   cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessed with feature
   tracking (FT) and tagging, in patients with aortic stenosis (AS).
   Materials and MethodsCardiac MRI was performed twice (1-14 days apart)
   in 18 patients (8 at 1.5 Tesla [T], 10 at 3T) with moderate-severe AS.
   Circumferential peak systolic strain (PSS) and PEDSR were measured in
   all patients. Longitudinal PSS and PEDSR were assessed using FT in all
   patients, and tagging in the 3T sub-group.
   ResultsPSS was higher with FT than tagging (21.0 1.9% versus 17.0 +/-
   3.4% at 1.5T, 21.4 +/- 4.0% versus 17.7 +/- 3.0% at 3T, P < 0.05), as
   was PEDSR (1.3 +/- 0.3 s(-1) versus 1.0 +/- 0.3 s(-1), P = 0.10 at 1.5T
   and 1.3 +/- 0.4 s(-1) versus 0.8 +/- 0.3 s(-1), P < 0.05 at 3T). The
   reproducibility of PSS was excellent with FT (coefficient of variation
   [CoV] 9-10%) and good with tagging at 1.5T (13-19%). Reproducibility of
   circumferential PEDSR was best at 1.5T when only basal/mid slices were
   included (CoV 12%), but moderate to poor at 3T (29-35%). Reproducibility
   of longitudinal strain was good with FT (10-16%) but moderate for PEDSR
   (approximate to 30%).
   ConclusionIn patients with AS, FT consistently produces higher values
   compared with tagging. The interstudy reproducibility of PSS is
   excellent with FT and good with tagging. The reproducibility of
   circumferential PEDSR at 1.5T is good when only basal and mid slices are
   used. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2015;41:1129-1137. (c) 2014 Wiley

   nanoparticles are investigated by scanning electron microscopy and the
   average diameter is approximately 80-100 nm. Structural quality of Co3O4
   nanoparticles is confirmed from X-ray powder diffraction measurements,
   while the Raman spectroscopy has been used to understand the chemical
   bonding between different atoms. The magnetic measurement has confirmed
   that Co3O4 nanoparticles show ferromagnetic behavior, which could be
   attributed to the uncompensated surface spins and/or finite size
   effects. The ferromagnetic order of Co3O4 nanoparticles is raised with
   increasing the decomposition temperature. A physical adsorption method
   is adopted to immobilize the surface of CS/Co3O4 nanocomposite.
   Potentiometric sensitivity curve has been measured over the
   concentration range between 1 x 10(-4) and 8 x 10(-2) M of urea

AB Studies of the natural history of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection

   widely used. We sought to develop a cost-effective, high-throughput
   alternative using the same PGMY09/11 primer/probe system and offering
   sensitivity and specificity comparable to those with LA to ensure
   continuity in longitudinal studies. We report here on a Luminex-based
   approach, PGMY-LX, that offers type-specific detection of 33 oncogenic
   and nononcogenic types. Detection of HPV type-specific plasmid DNA was
   highly specific, with high signal-to-noise ratios for all types except
   nononcogenic type 40 and no cross-reactivity between types. Cohen's
   unweighted kappa values for 378 clinical samples tested by both LA and
   PGMY-LX were >= 0.8 (range, 0.80 to 1.0) for 25 types, including
   oncogenic HPV types 16, 31, 33, 39, 45, 58, and 59 and possibly
   oncogenic types 53, 66, 73, and 82) and >0.7 (range, 0.74 to 0.79) for
   oncogenic types 18, 35, 51, and 56 and probable oncogenic type 68b,
   indicating substantial or better type-specific agreement between the two
   methods. The reproducibility by PGMY-LX of the types detected by LA
   varied from 94% when a single HPV type was present to 66% when multiple
   types were present. The interrun reproducibility for PGMY-LX varied from
   98% for single-type infections to 85% for multiple-type infections. The
   high reproducibility of PGMY-LX and the type-specific agreement with LA
   allows PGMY-LX to be incorporated into longitudinal, cohort studies that
   have historically relied on LA.

AB Mycoplasma hyorhinis (M. hyorhinis) has re-emerged as an important swine
   pathogen in recent years causing significant economic losses in post
   weaning pigs. Genetic variability of M. hyorhinis has been described
   based on different molecular methods that have limited resolution and
   reproducibility. The present study was undertaken to develop a molecular
   epidemiological typing tool for M. hyorhinis based on multiple loci of
   variable number of tandem repeats in its genome, termed MLVA. The typing
   method was designed on the basis of the number of repeats in two
   hypothetical proteins, MHR_0152 and MHR_0298. A total of 205 samples
   were analyzed, including field isolates, clinical specimens, and a
   reference strain. Analysis of the combination of the 2 loci revealed 16
   MLVA types in 165 of the 205 samples. In the remaining forty samples
   only one locus could be amplified. The most frequent types obtained from
   the set of samples were 8-4 (36.9%), 8-3 (11.5%), 7-4 (11.5%), 9-4
   (10.9%) and 10-4 (9.3%). The Simpson's diversity index for the assay was
   D = 0.814 when the 165 samples were taken into account. No clustering
   was observed based on the geographical location, sample type, or year of
   isolation or sampling. The MLVA assay developed in this investigation
   showed to be a reproducible and portable assay which could be easily
   performed and transferred to other laboratories. The use of this
   technique will assist in epidemiological investigations and can be used
   to improve the understanding the molecular biology of M. hyorhinis
   variants. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A wet-chemical approach is used to fabricate centimeter-scale gold
   nanoisland films (NIFs) with tunable morphology of islands and with
   strong electromagnetic coupling between them. The approach consists in a
   uniform seeding of small gold nanoparticles on a glass or silicon
   substrate, followed by controllable growth of the seeds into small
   nanoislands. A special technique for TEM sampling was developed to
   follow the gradual formation of larger-sized isolated nanoparticles,
   nanoislands of sintered overgrown seeds, and a complete gold layer with
   nanoscale cracks. The electromagnetic field distribution inside the
   fabricated NIFs was calculated by FDTD simulations applied to actual TEM
   images of the fabricated samples rather than to artificial models
   commonly used. SERS measurements with 1,4-aminothiophenol (ATP)
   molecules demonstrated the analytical enhancement factor about of 10(7)
   and the fundamental enhancement factor about of 10(8) for optimized
   substrates. These values were at least 1 order of magnitude higher than
   that for self-assembled arrays of gold nanostars and silver nanocubes.
   SERS spectra of independent samples demonstrated good sample-to-sample
   reproducibility in terms of the relative standard deviation (RSD) of the
   main peaks less than 20%. Additionally, Raman maps with 1 mum increment
   in X-Y directions of NIFs (800 spectral spots) demonstrated good
   point-to-point repeatability in the intensity of the main Raman
   vibration modes (RSD varied from 5% to 15% for 50 randomly selected
   points). A real-life application of the fabricated SERS substrates is
   exemplified by the detection of the thiram fungicide in apple peels
   within the 5-250 ppb linear detection range. Specifically, the NIF-based
   SERS technology detected thiram on apple peel down to level of 5
   ng/cm(2).

AB CO2 adsorption was investigated on amine-functionalized mesoporous
   silica (SBA-15) and periodic mesoporous organosilica (PMO) samples.
   Hexagonally (p6mm) ordered mesoporous SBA-15 and benzene-PMO (BPMO)
   samples were prepared in the presence of Pluronic P123 block copolymer
   template under acidic conditions. Three kinds of amine-containing
   organosilanes and polyethylenimine were used to functionalize SBA-15 and
   BPMO. Small-angle X-ray scattering and nitrogen adsorption isotherms
   showed that these samples featured ordered mesostructure, high surface
   area, and narrow pore size distributions. Solid-state (13)C- and (29)Si
   cross-polarization magic-angle spinning NMR spectra showed chemical
   linkage between amine-containing modifiers and the surface of mesoporous
   materials. The chemically linked amine-containing modifiers were found
   to be on both the inner and outer surfaces.
   N-[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]ethylenediamine-modified BPMO (A2-BPMO)
   sample exhibited the highest CO2 uptake (i.e., 3.03 mmol/g measured on a
   volumetric adsorption analyzer) and the fastest adsorption rate (i.e.,
   13 min to attain 90% of the maximum amount) among all the samples
   studied. Selectivity and reproducibility measurements for the A2-BPMO
   sample showed quite good performance in flowing N2 gas at 40 mL/min and
   CO2 gas of 60 mL/min at 25 °C.

AB OBJECTIVE: To objectify and quantify inter- and intra-observer
   variability of brain 18-FDG PET-CT interpretation in the context of
   cognitive and functional impairment amongst the elderly.
   METHODS: 25 patients underwent brain 18-FDG PET-CT for investigation of
   dementia/MCI and frail elderly patients. Three observers interpreted
   studies in two forms: standardised datasets reconstructed by an outside
   observer and individualised reconstructions. Observers graded regional
   18-FDG uptake in 11 brain areas and gave overall impressions on studies
   as pathological/normal. One observer repeated this process following a
   3-month interval. The Kappa statistic was used to calculate inter- and
   intra-observer agreement on grading of regional 18-FDG uptake and
   overall impressions of studies as pathological/normal.
   RESULTS: Moderate inter-observer agreement was observed across
   standardised and individualised dataset reconstructions when 11 regional
   brain areas were compared cumulatively and overall impressions on
   studies were given as pathological vs normal. Higher levels of
   inter-observer agreement were found when comparing high versus low
   grading of regional uptake and when reporting standardised
   reconstructions. Intra-observer agreement between standardised vs
   individualised dataset reconstructions were moderate-to-fair across 11
   brain regions cumulatively. Temporal intra-observer agreement of
   individualised dataset reconstructions comparing normal vs pathological
   opinions showed strong agreement (kappa=0.884 [95% CI 0.662; 1.000)].
   CONCLUSION: Despite a strong agreement in final diagnosis, this study
   demonstrates a moderate inter- and substantial intra-observer
   reproducibility in reporting brain 18-FDG PET-CT. Such results suggest
   that the visual analysis approach is different between nuclear
   physicians but leads to the same final diagnosis.

AB OBJECTIVE: Static renal scintigraphy with Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid
   (DMSA) is considered a scintigraphic gold standard in detection of
   post-inflammatory renal scars. Reports on usefulness of conventional
   summed (SUM) Tc-99m mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3) or Tc-99m ethylene
   dicysteine (EC) dynamic scintigraphic images in detection of renal
   scarring are ambiguous and some authors emphasize low sensitivity of
   this method. The work aimed at assessment of a diagnostic efficacy of
   parametric clearance images (PAR) generated from a dynamic renal
   scintigraphy in detection of renal scars.
   METHODS: A study group consisting of 80 children (56 girls, 24 boys, age
   5-18years) with recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI) and documented
   one to five incidents of APN-28 children, and with recurrent UTI of the
   lower part of the urinary tract only-52 children. Altogether 160 kidneys
   were evaluated. Static renal Tc-99m DMSA SPECT scintigraphy and after
   2-4days Tc-99m EC dynamic renal scintigraphy were performed in every
   patient not earlier than 6months after the last documented incident of
   UTI. PAR images generated from a dynamic renal scintigraphy acquired
   between 40 and 140s. generated by in-house developed software and SUM
   images obtained in the same time period were compared with a reference
   Tc-99m DMSA SPECT study.
   RESULTS: For all kinds of images (SPECT, PAR and SUM), high indices of
   reproducibility were obtained-89% (kappa=0.80), 88% (kappa=0.78) and 89%
   (kappa=0.73). Agreement in a Howard scale of a reference method (SPECT)
   with PAR and SUM methods amounted to 83 and 64%, respectively (p=0.004).
   Sensitivity and accuracy of PAR method as compared with SUM method were
   significantly higher: 89 vs. 49% (p<0.0001) and 88 vs. 73% (p=0.002),
   and specificity was slightly lower: 88 vs. 93% (p=0.043). SPECT and PAR
   methods revealed higher incidence of renal scars than a SUM method in
   patients with documented incident(s) of APN-64, 68 and 39%, p=0.009 and
   0.008, respectively.
   CONCLUSION: PAR images generated from a dynamic renal scintigraphy
   improved sensitivity of detection of renal scars as compared with SUM
   images, providing a high reproducibility and diagnostic efficacy,
   similar to that of Tc-99m DMSA, in detection of post-inflammatory renal
   scarring.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe the principles and operation of a new
   telemetry-based function test for the Nucleus cochlear implant, known as
   the CS19 Intra-Cochlear Impedance Matrix (IIM) and to present results
   from a multicentre clinical study to establish reproducibility
   (test-retest reliability) and normative ranges.
   METHOD: The IIM test measures bipolar impedances between all electrode
   pairs and employs a normalization procedure based on common ground
   impedances in order to identify abnormal current paths among electrodes.
   Six European clinics collected IIM data from a total of 192 devices.
   RESULTS: Reproducibility was high between initial and repeat
   measurements. The normative analysis demonstrated narrow ranges among
   devices after normalization of impedance data. The IIM is able to
   identify abnormal current paths that are not evident from standard
   impedance telemetry and may otherwise only be found utilising average
   electrode voltage measurements (AEV).
   CONCLUSIONS: The IIM test was found to be straightforward to perform
   clinically and demonstrated reproducible data with narrow ranges in
   normally-functioning devices. Because this test uses a very low
   stimulation level the IIM test is well suited for children or multiply
   handicapped CI users who cannot reliably report on their auditory
   percepts. The new algorithms show potential to improve implant integrity
   testing capabilities if implemented in future clinical software.

AB PURPOSE: Next-generation sequencing-based methods are being adopted
   broadly for genetic diagnostic testing, but the performance
   characteristics of these techniques with regard to test accuracy and
   reproducibility have not been fully defined.
   METHODS: We developed a targeted enrichment and next-generation
   sequencing approach for genetic diagnostic testing of patients with
   inherited eye disorders, including inherited retinal degenerations,
   optic atrophy, and glaucoma. In preparation for providing this genetic
   eye disease (GEDi) test on a CLIA-certified basis, we performed
   experiments to measure the sensitivity, specificity, and
   reproducibility, as well as the clinical sensitivity, of the test.
   RESULTS: The GEDi test is highly reproducible and accurate, with
   sensitivity and specificity of 97.9 and 100%, respectively, for
   single-nucleotide variant detection. The sensitivity for variant
   detection was notably better than the 88.3% achieved by whole-exome
   sequencing using the same metrics, because of better coverage of
   targeted genes in the GEDi test as compared with a commercially
   available exome capture set. Prospective testing of 192 patients with
   inherited retinal degenerations indicated that the clinical sensitivity
   of the GEDi test is high, with a diagnostic rate of 51%.
   CONCLUSION: Based on quantified performance metrics, the data suggest
   that selective targeted enrichment is preferable to whole-exome
   sequencing for genetic diagnostic testing.Genet Med 17 4, 253-261.

   aberrometer-topographer (iTrace Visual Function Analyzer) for 5
   accommodative stimuli.
   SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, Goethe-University, Frankfurt,
   Germany.
   DESIGN: Prospective case series.
   METHODS: Eyes of young adults with low to moderate myopia or hyperopia
   were examined in 2 measurement series comprising 3 corneal topography
   measurements and wavefront measurements focusing on targets at 5
   distances (0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 1.0, and 4.0 m). Repeatability was analyzed
   using the standard deviation (SD) within 6 measurements and the
   coefficient of repeatability (CoR) by Bland-Altman analysis of the means
   of the 2 measurement series.
   RESULTS: Fifty eyes (50 subjects) were evaluated. The lowest calculated
   mean SD/CoR measurements using the aberrometer function at 5 target
   distances were 0.07 mum/0.14 mum for total ocular aberrations root mean
   square (RMS), 0.07 mum/0.16 mum for lower-order aberrations (LOAs) RMS,
   0.03 mum/0.66 mum for higher-order aberrations (HOAs) RMS, 0.10 diopter
   (D)/0.22 D for sphere, 0.08 D/0.13 D for cylinder, and 0.09 D/0.21 D for
   the spherical equivalent (SE). Repeatability of the total RMS, LOAs RMS,
   sphere, and SE measurements improved with increasing target distance (P
   < .01 for aberrometric values; P < .03 for refractive values).
   Measurement reproducibility using the corneal topographer showed mean
   SDs/CoRs of 0.19 mum/0.41 mum for total RMS, 0.19 mum/0.39 mum for LOAs
   RMS, and 0.08 mum/0.23 mum for HOAs RMS.
   CONCLUSION: The aberrometer showed satisfactory results for measurement
   repeatability at all target distances and declining repeatability with
   increasing accommodation effort.

AB UNLABELLED: PET with selective adenosine 2A receptor (A2A) radiotracers
   can be used to study a variety of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric
   disorders in vivo and to support drug-discovery studies targeting A2A.
   The aim of this study was to describe the first in vivo evaluation of
   (18)F-MNI-444, a novel PET radiotracer for imaging A2A, in healthy human
   subjects.
   METHODS: Ten healthy human volunteers were enrolled in this study; 6
   completed the brain PET studies and 4 participated in the whole-body PET
   studies. Arterial blood was collected for invasive kinetic modeling of
   the brain PET data. Noninvasive methods of data quantification were also
   explored. Test-retest reproducibility was evaluated in 5 subjects.
   Radiotracer distribution and dosimetry was determined using serial
   whole-body PET images acquired over 6 h post-radiotracer injection.
   Urine samples were collected to calculate urinary excretion.
   RESULTS: After intravenous bolus injection, (18)F-MNI-444 rapidly
   entered the brain and displayed a distribution consistent with known A2A
   densities in the brain. Binding potentials ranging from 2.6 to 4.9 were
   measured in A2A-rich regions, with an average test-retest variability of
   less than 10%. The estimated whole-body radiation effective dose was
   approximately 0.023 mSv/MBq.
   CONCLUSION: (18)F-MNI-444 is a useful PET radiotracer for imaging A2A in
   the human brain. The superior in vivo brain kinetic properties of
   (18)F-MNI-444, compared with previously developed A2A radiotracers,
   provide the opportunity to foster global use of in vivo A2A PET imaging
   in neuroscience research.

   silt a 23.0-51.1 %, sand a 7.2-72.0 %, and pH a 4.0-8.1.

   (resp. LOQs, 0.066(7) ng mL(-1)) in the frame of the concentration range
   a 0.02-50.00 ng mL(-1). The results have overcome those analytical
   quantities obtained, using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in a
   tandem mode of operation (GC-MS/MS) or ultra fast liquid chromatography
   coupled to ESI method (UFLC-ESI-MS/MS) methods.
   In this paper, we have reported firstly in the literature a soil
   analysis involving DLLME/UV-MALDI-MS. The high-quality applied research
   approach that is taken here addresses two problems. They have noticed on
   the one hand lack of comprehensive understanding of the enantio/stereo
   selective degradation processes of chiral fungicides in soils and on the
   other hand lack of reliable references to a large scale of specific
   problems of the analysis of organic pollutants in soils. The analytical
   information reflects the instrumental benefits and advantages of MALDI
   method for the field of environmental chemistry, in particular,
   assessment of the risk to the human health from agricultural organic
   contamination in soils.

AB The intraperitoneal application of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) alone or in
   combination with other hepatotoxins is an experimental model for
   inducing systemic and hepatic inflammation in rodents applied worldwide.
   The endotoxin is recognized by the LPS-binding protein. This complex
   binds together with the lymphocyte antigen 96 (MD2) and the
   pattern-recognition receptor CD14 to members of the toll-like receptor
   family. The activated receptor complex in turn transduces signals to
   well characterized intracellular cascades that result in a multifaceted
   network of intracellular responses ending in inflammation. The most
   prominent among these is the activation of the NF-kappaB pathway and the
   production of a multitude of inflammatory cytokines. Although the
   application of LPS is in general easy to perform, unintended variations
   in preparation of the injection solution or in handling of the animals
   might affect the reproducibility or the outcome of a specific
   experiment. Here, we present a well-standardized protocol that allows
   for an induction of highly reproducible acute hepatic inflammation in
   mice. Furthermore, examples of appropriate readouts for the resulting
   inflammatory response are given.

AB The induction of experimental obstructive cholestasis is a reliable
   model for cholestatic liver diseases in rodents. Bile duct ligation
   (BDL) in mice provokes typical time-dependent morphological and
   structural changes in the liver, ranging from liver cell injury and
   elevated serum enzyme levels after several days, to a severe
   inflammatory response in the liver after 5-7 days, up to an advanced
   hepatic fibrosis as soon as three to four weeks after surgical ligation
   of the common biliary duct. Upon BDL induction, hepatic stellate cells
   become activated and transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts that produce
   extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen. In principle, the
   periportal fibrosis induced by BDL in rat livers is reversible. After
   the relief of a biliary obstruction, the liver has the capacity to
   revert to a nearly normal histological architecture and a fully normal
   biochemical function. When BDL surgery is performed by an experienced
   scientist, this model has very high reproducibility among all fibrotic
   models. All these factors corroborate the outstanding value of this
   model for basic and translational research in biomedicine and
   hepatology. Nevertheless, this model can result in significant
   variations when surgery is carried out by untrained personnel or when
   unconscious modifications are implemented that affect the quality of the
   intervention. A detailed protocol is provided here for the provision of
   reliable and reproducible BDL in mice.

AB PURPOSE: Our goal in this work was to investigate the impact of CT-based
   attenuation correction on measurements of rat myocardial perfusion with
   (99m)Tc and (201)Tl single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).
   METHODS: Eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with
   (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin and scanned in a small animal pinhole SPECT/CT
   scanner. Scans were repeated weekly over a period of 5 weeks. Eight
   additional rats were injected with (201)Tl and also scanned following a
   similar protocol. The images were reconstructed with and without
   attenuation correction, and the relative perfusion was analyzed with the
   commercial cardiac analysis software. The absolute uptake of (99m)Tc in
   the heart was also quantified with and without attenuation correction.
   RESULTS: For (99m)Tc imaging, relative segmental perfusion changed by up
   to +2.1%/-1.8% as a result of attenuation correction. Relative changes
   of +3.6%/-1.0% were observed for the (201)Tl images. Interscan and
   inter-rat reproducibilities of relative segmental perfusion were 2.7%
   and 3.9%, respectively, for the uncorrected (99m)Tc scans, and 3.6% and
   4.3%, respectively, for the (201)Tl scans, and were not significantly
   affected by attenuation correction for either tracer. Attenuation
   correction also significantly increased the measured absolute uptake of
   tetrofosmin and significantly altered the relationship between the rat
   weight and tracer uptake.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that attenuation correction has a small
   but statistically significant impact on the relative perfusion
   measurements in some segments of the heart and does not adversely affect
   reproducibility. Attenuation correction had a small but statistically
   significant impact on measured absolute tracer uptake.

AB PURPOSE: Rupture of atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid artery has
   been implicated in 20% of strokes. 3D ultrasound (US) imaging is
   emerging as an attractive method to quantify plaque burden and track
   changes in plaque longitudinally over time. However, plaque segmentation
   from US images is challenging because of poor boundary contrast and
   shadowing. The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate a
   semiautomatic segmentation algorithm with a novel stopping criterion for
   segmenting outer wall boundary (OWB) and lumen intima boundary (LIB) of
   common, internal, and external carotid artery from 3D US images for
   quantifying the vessel wall volume (VWV).
   METHODS: 3D US image volumes were acquired from ten subjects with
   asymptomatic carotid stenoses. Volumes were acquired using a
   mechanically scanned linear probe, and the reconstructed volume
   consisted of 21 slices acquired at an interslice distance of 1 mm. The
   authors used distance regularized level set method with edge-based
   energy, region-based energy, smoothness energy, and a novel stopping
   criterion to segment the LIB and OWB of carotid artery. The algorithm
   was initialized by six user-selected points on the LIB and OWB in seven
   2D cross-sectional slices in each volume. An ellipse fitting and a
   stopping boundary-based energy is proposed to smooth the OWB contour and
   to stop leaking of the evolving contour, respectively. The algorithm was
   compared against ground truth boundaries generated from manual
   segmentations. The dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance
   (HD), and modified HD (MHD) were used as error metrics.
   RESULTS: The authors' proposed stopping boundary energy-based stopping
   criterion was compared with percentage change of area and change of the
   MHD between evolving contours at successive iterations stopping
   criteria. The performance of the proposed algorithm was better than
   other two stopping criteria and yielded mean of LIBDSC = 88.78%, OWBDSC
   = 94.81%, LIBMHD = 0.26 mm, OWBMHD = 0.25 mm, LIBHD = 0.74 mm, and OWBHD
   = 0.80 mm. The Bland-Altman plot and correlation coefficient (r = 0.99)
   indicated a high agreement between ground truth and algorithm-generated
   boundaries. The coefficient of variation (COV) and minimum detectable
   change of the VWV are 5.2% and 57.2 mm(3) (5.18% of mean VWV),
   calculated from repeated measurements of the VWV by algorithm. The mean
   absolute distance between corresponding points of the
   algorithm-generated and the ground truth boundaries was 0.25 mm.
   CONCLUSIONS: The authors have developed a semiautomatic segmentation
   algorithm for measuring the VWV of the carotid artery using 3D US images
   with reduced operator interaction and computational time and higher
   reproducibility using a commercially available 3D US transducer. Their
   method is a step forward toward routine longitudinal monitoring of 3D
   plaque progression.

AB PURPOSE: To investigate for the first time the dosimetric properties of
   a new commercial synthetic diamond detector (PTW microDiamond) in
   high-energy scanned clinical carbon ion beams generated by a synchrotron
   at the CNAO facility.
   METHODS: The detector response was evaluated in a water phantom with
   actively scanned carbon ion beams ranging from 115 to 380 MeV/u (30-250
   mm Bragg peak depth in water). Homogeneous square fields of 3 * 3 and 6
   * 6 cm(2) were used. Short- and medium-term (2 months) detector response
   stability, dependence on beam energy as well as ion type (carbon ions
   and protons), linearity with dose, and directional and dose-rate
   dependence were investigated. The depth dose curve of a 280 MeV/u carbon
   ion beam, scanned over a 3 * 3 cm(2) area, was measured with the
   microDiamond detector and compared to that measured using a PTW Advanced
   Markus ionization chamber, and also simulated using fluka Monte Carlo
   code. The detector response in two spread-out-Bragg-peaks (SOBPs),
   respectively, centered at 9 and 21 cm depths in water and calculated
   using the treatment planning system (TPS) used at CNAO, was measured.
   RESULTS: A negligible drift of detector sensitivity within the
   experimental session was seen, indicating that no detector
   preirradiation was needed. Short-term response reproducibility around 1%
   (1 standard deviation) was found. Only 2% maximum variation of
   microDiamond sensitivity was observed among all the evaluated proton and
   carbon ion beam energies. The detector response showed a good linear
   behavior. Detector sensitivity was found to be dose-rate independent,
   with a variation below 1.3% in the evaluated dose-rate range. A very
   good agreement between measured and simulated Bragg curves with both
   microDiamond and Advanced Markus chamber was found, showing a negligible
   LET dependence of the tested detector. A depth dose curve was also
   measured by positioning the microDiamond with its main axis oriented
   orthogonally to the beam direction. A strong distortion in Bragg peak
   measurement was observed, confirming manufacturer recommendation on
   avoiding such configuration. Very good results were obtained for SOBP
   measurements, with a difference below 1% between measured and
   TPS-calculated doses. The stability of detector sensitivity in the
   observation period was within the experimental uncertainty.
   CONCLUSIONS: Dosimetric characterization of a PTW microDiamond detector
   in high-energy scanned carbon ion beams was performed. The results of
   the present study showed that this detector is suitable for dosimetry of
   clinical carbon ion beams, with a negligible LET and dose-rate
   dependence.

AB The potential risk of recurrence and progression in patients with
   non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer necessitates followup by cystoscopy.
   The risk of progression to muscle-invasive bladder cancer is estimated
   based on the European Organisation of Research and Treatment of Cancer
   score, a combination of several clinicopathological variables. However,
   pathological assessment is not objective and reproducibility is
   insufficient. The use of molecular markers could contribute to the
   estimation of tumor aggressiveness. We recently demonstrated that
   methylation of GATA2, TBX2, TBX3, and ZIC4 genes could predict
   progression in Ta tumors. In this study, we aimed to validate the
   markers in a large patient set using DNA from formalin-fixed and
   paraffin-embedded tissue. PALGA: the Dutch Pathology Registry was used
   for patient selection. We included 192 patients with pTaG1/2 bladder
   cancer of whom 77 experienced progression. Methylation analysis was
   performed and log-rank analysis was used to calculate the predictive
   value of each methylation marker for developing progression over time.
   This analysis showed better progression-free survival in patients with
   low methylation rates compared with the patients with high methylation
   rates for all markers (P<0.001) during a followup of ten-years. The
   combined predictive effect of the methylation markers was analyzed with
   the Cox-regression method. In this analysis, TBX2, TBX3, and ZIC4 were
   independent predictors of progression. On the basis of methylation
   status of TBX2 and TBX3, patients were divided into three new molecular
   grade groups. Survival analysis showed that only 8% of patients in the
   low molecular grade group progressed within 5 years. This was 29 and 63%
   for the intermediate- and high-molecular grade groups. In conclusion,
   this new molecular-grade based on the combination of TBX2 and TBX3
   methylation is an excellent marker for predicting progression to
   muscle-invasive bladder cancer in patients with primary pTaG1/2 bladder
   cancer.

AB Object recognition technology is usually used for recognizing specific
   objects, such as book covers, landmarks, vehicles, etc. This technology
   is supported by multi-dimensional local image descriptors in most
   situations. These descriptors are designed to be robust to the
   environmental changes, such as illumination change, view angle change,
   scale change, etc. If there are many target objects in your database,
   object recognition using large scale local image descriptor database may
   not be a trivial task, because of the high dimensionality of the local
   image descriptors. For consistent responses from a large-scale database
   with a reasonable time delay, we need to have a proper data structure
   which supports the indexing and querying functionality. A vocabulary
   tree is a data structure based on local image descriptors, and this data
   structure is commonly used to cope with massive databases containing
   local image descriptors. By using a vocabulary tree, a local image
   descriptor can be mapped to a vocabulary tree's leaf node ID,
   constructing a visual word for object recognition. Visual words are then
   effectively exploited by a traditional text retrieval engine. In this
   study, we built a large-scale object recognition system using a
   vocabulary tree that had leaf nodes of 1 million Scale-Invariant Feature
   Transform (SIFT) descriptors, which is the most promising local image
   descriptor in terms of precision. We implement proposed system using
   publicly available software so that further enhancements and/or
   reproducibility would be easily accomplished. We then compared and
   evaluated the proposed system's performance with the current MPEG CDVS
   (Compact Descriptors for Visual Search) standard using a database
   containing two dimensional planar object datasets of three categories
   with one million distracter images. In addition to these datasets, which
   are equivalent to those of CDVS, we add a new dataset which are made to
   mimic realistic occlusion and clutter effects. Experimental results show
   that our proposed system's performance is comparable to that of the CDVS
   achieving 90 % precision at 5 s retrieval time. We also find
   characteristics of vocabulary tree limiting adaptation to a specific
   application domain.

AB The aim of the present study was to genetically characterize Fasciola
   hepatica strains from diverse ecogeographical regions (America and
   Europe), susceptible and resistant to Triclabendazole, using the random
   amplified polymorphic DNA fragments (RAPDs-PCR) technique to elucidate
   genetic variability between the different isolates. Ten different
   oligonucleotide primers of 10 bases with GC content varying from 50-70%
   were used. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out in 25 mu l
   of total volume. Duplicate PCR reactions on each individual template DNA
   were performed to test the reproducibility of the individual DNA bands.
   The size of the RAPD-PCR fragments was determined by the reciprocal plot
   between the delay factors (Rf) versus the logarithm of molecular weight
   ladder. The phenogram obtained showed three main clusters, the major of
   which contained European Strains (Cullompton and Sligo) showing a
   genetic distance of 27.2 between them. The American strains (Cedive and
   Cajamarca) on the other hand formed each their distinctive group but
   clearly maintaining a closer genetic relationship among them than that
   to their European counterparts, with which showed a distance of 33.8 and
   37.8, respectively. This polymorphism would give this species enhanced
   adaptability against the host, as well as the environment. The existence
   of genetically different populations of F. hepatica could allow, against
   any selection pressure, natural or artificial (for use fasciolicides
   products and/or control measures), one or more populations of F.
   hepatica to be able to survive and create resistance or adaptability to
   such selective pressure.

AB Study Design Retrospective secondary analysis of data. Objectives To
   investigate the external validity of the whiplash clinical prediction
   rule (CPR). Background We recently derived a whiplash CPR to consolidate
   previously established prognostic factors for poor recovery from a
   whiplash injury and predicted 2 recovery pathways. Prognostic factors
   for full recovery were being less than 35 years of age and having an
   initial Neck Disability Index (NDI) score of 32% or less. Prognostic
   factors for ongoing moderate/severe pain and disability were being 35
   years of age or older, having an initial NDI score of 40% or more, and
   the presence of hyperarousal symptoms. Validation is required to confirm
   the reproducibility and accuracy of this CPR. Clinician feedback on the
   usefulness of the CPR is also important to gauge acceptability. Methods
   A secondary analysis of data from 101 individuals with acute
   whiplash-associated disorder who had previously participated in either a
   randomized controlled clinical trial or prospective cohort study was
   performed using accuracy statistics. Full recovery was defined as NDI
   score at 6 months of 10% or less, and ongoing moderate/severe pain and
   disability were defined as an NDI score at 6 months of 30% or greater.
   In addition, a small sample of physical therapists completed an
   anonymous survey on the clinical acceptability and usability of the
   tool. Results The positive predictive value of ongoing moderate/severe
   pain and disability was 90.9% in the validation cohort, and the positive
   predictive value of full recovery was 80.0%. Surveyed physical
   therapists reported that the whiplash CPR was simple, understandable,
   would be easy to use, and was an acceptable prognostic tool. Conclusion
   External validation of the whiplash CPR confirmed the reproducibility
   and accuracy of this dual-pathway tool for individuals with acute
   whiplash-associated disorder. Further research is needed to assess
   prospective validation, the impact of inclusion on practice, and to
   examine the efficacy of linking treatment strategies with predicted
   prognosis. Level of Evidence Prognosis, level 1b. J Orthop Sports Phys

AB Atomic resolution has been obtained using environmental transmission
   electron microscopy (ETEM) by installing a spherical aberration
   corrector (Cs-corrector) on the objective lens. Simultaneously, the
   technology for controlling the environment around a specimen in ETEM has
   advanced significantly in the past decade. Quantification methodology
   has recently been established for deriving relevant experimental data in
   catalyst materials from substantial and systematic ETEM observation at
   the atomic scale. With this background, this paper summarizes aspects of
   the evolutional microscopy technique: necessary conditions for atomic
   resolution in ETEM; reduction of the scattering of electrons by the
   medium surrounding a specimen; and an environmental cell for structural
   imaging of a crystalline specimen. The high spatial resolution of a
   Cs-corrected ETEM is demonstrated for different observation conditions.
   After statistical analysis combined with numerical image analysis of
   ETEM data is briefly described, the recent applications of the
   Cs-corrected ETEM to catalyst materials are reviewed. For gold
   nanoparticulate catalysts, the structural information on the reaction
   sites and adsorption sites are deduced. For Pt nanoparticulate
   catalysts, ETEM studies elucidate the correlation between the catalytic
   activity and the morphology of the nanoparticles. These studies also
   reveal oxidation and reduction on the topmost Pt surface layer at the
   atomic scale. Finally, current issues and the future perspectives of
   Cs-corrected ETEM are summarized, including the reproducibility of ETEM
   observation data the control of environments, the critical evaluation of
   electron irradiation effects, the full implementation of transmission
   electron microscopy technology in ETEM, and the safety issues for an

AB OBJECTIVES: To assess interobserver reproducibility among ultrasound
   experts and gynecologists in the prediction by transvaginal ultrasound
   of deep myometrial and cervical stromal invasion in women with
   endometrial cancer.
   METHODS: Sonographic videoclips of the uterine corpus and cervix of 53
   women with endometrial cancer, examined preoperatively by the same
   ultrasound expert, were integrated into a digitalized survey. Nine
   ultrasound experts and nine gynecologists evaluated presence or absence
   of deep myometrial and cervical stromal invasion. Histopathology from
   hysterectomy specimens was used as the gold standard.
   RESULTS: Compared with gynecologists, ultrasound experts showed higher
   sensitivity, specificity and agreement with histopathology in the
   assessment of cervical stromal invasion (42% (95% CI, 31-53%) vs 57%
   (95% CI, 45-68%), P<0.01; 83% (95% CI, 78-86%) vs 87% (95% CI, 83-90%),
   P=0.02; and kappa, 0.45 (95% CI, 0.40-0.49) vs 0.58 (95% CI, 0.53-0.62),
   P<0.001, respectively) but not of deep myometrial invasion (73% (95% CI,
   66-79%) vs 73% (95% CI, 66-79%), P=1.0; 70% (95% CI, 65-75%) vs 69% (95%
   CI, 63-74%), P=0.68; and kappa, 0.48 (95% CI, 0.44-0.53) vs 0.52 (95%
   CI, 0.48-0.57), P=0.11, respectively). Though interobserver
   reproducibility (in the context of test proportions 'good' and 'very
   good', according to kappa) regarding deep myometrial invasion did not
   differ between the groups (experts, 34% vs gynecologists, 22%, P=0.13),
   ultrasound experts assessed cervical stromal invasion with significantly
   greater interobserver reproducibility than did gynecologists (53% vs
   14%, P<0.001).
   CONCLUSION: Preoperative ultrasound assessment of deep myometrial and
   cervical stromal invasion in endometrial cancer is best performed by
   ultrasound experts, as, compared with gynecologists, they showed a
   greater degree of agreement with histopathology and greater
   interobserver reproducibility in the assessment of cervical stromal
   invasion. Copyright  2014 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB Previous studies have shown the reproducibility of the 2008 World Health
   Organization (WHO) classification in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS),
   especially when multilineage dysplasia or excess of blasts are present.
   However, there are few data regarding the reproducibility of MDS with
   unilineage dysplasia. The revised International Prognostic Scoring
   System R-IPSS described two new morphological categories, distinguishing
   bone marrow (BM) blast cell count between 0-2 % and > 2-aEuro parts per
   thousand < 5 %. This distinction is critical for establishing prognosis,
   but the reproducibility of this threshold is still not demonstrated. The
   objectives of our study were to explore the reliability of the 2008 WHO
   classification, regarding unilineage vs. multilineage dysplasia, by
   reviewing 110 cases previously diagnosed with MDS, and to study whether
   the threshold of a parts per thousand currency sign2 % BM blasts is
   reproducible among different observers. We used the same methodology as
   in our previous paper [Font et al. (2013) Ann Hematol 92:19-24], by
   encouraging investigators to include patients with < 5 % BM blasts.
   Samples were collected from 11 hospitals and were evaluated by 11
   morphologists. Each observer evaluated 20 samples, and each sample was
   analyzed independently by two morphologists. Discordance was observed in
   36/108 suitable cases (33 %, kappa test 0.503). Diagnosis of MDS with
   unilineage dysplasia (refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia
   (RCUD), refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) or
   unclassifiable MDS) was assessed in 33 patients, by either of the two
   observers. We combined this series with the cases with RCUD or RARS
   included in our 2013 paper, thus obtaining 50 cases with unilineage
   dysplasia by at least one of the observers. The whole series showed very
   low agreement regarding RCUD (5/23, 21 %) and RARS (5/28, 18 %).
   Regarding BM blast count, the threshold of a parts per thousand currency
   sign2 % was not reproducible (discordance rate 32/108 cases, kappa test
   0.277). Our study shows that among MDS WHO 2008 categories,
   interobserver discordance seems to be high in cases with unilineage
   dysplasia. We also illustrate that the threshold of a parts per thousand
   currency sign2 % BM blasts as settled by the R-IPSS may be not easy to
   reproduce by morphologists in real practice.

AB Hereditary and sporadic cerebellar ataxias represent a vast and still
   growing group of diseases whose diagnosis and differentiation cannot
   only rely on clinical evaluation. Brain imaging including magnetic
   resonance (MR) and nuclear medicine techniques allows for
   characterization of structural and functional abnormalities underlying
   symptomatic ataxias. These methods thus constitute a potential source of
   radiological biomarkers, which could be used to identify these diseases
   and differentiate subgroups of them, and to assess their severity and
   their evolution. Such biomarkers mainly comprise qualitative and
   quantitative data obtained from MR including proton spectroscopy,
   diffusion imaging, tractography, voxel-based morphometry, functional
   imaging during task execution or in a resting state, and from SPETC and
   PET with several radiotracers. In the current article, we aim to
   illustrate briefly some applications of these neuroimaging tools to
   evaluation of cerebellar disorders such as inherited cerebellar ataxia,
   fetal developmental malformations, and immune-mediated cerebellar
   diseases and of neurodegenerative or early-developing diseases, such as
   dementia and autism in which cerebellar involvement is an emerging
   feature. Although these radiological biomarkers appear promising and
   helpful to better understand ataxia-related anatomical and physiological
   impairments, to date, very few of them have turned out to be specific
   for a given ataxia with atrophy of the cerebellar system being the main
   and the most usual alteration being observed. Consequently, much remains
   to be done to establish sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of
   available MR and nuclear medicine features as diagnostic, progression
   and surrogate biomarkers in clinical routine.

AB ObjectiveThis study aimed to evaluate and compare the misclassification
   of periodontitis using two operational protocols currently employed in
   research, as a result of intra-examiner less-than-perfect reliability of
   their formative clinical parameters.
   MethodsFull-mouth duplicate recordings (six sites per tooth) of probing
   depth (PD) and clinical attachment level (CAL) were obtained by a single
   examiner, 1week apart, from 148 adults with self-perceived need for
   periodontal treatment. They were used to classify periodontitis subjects
   according to the protocols proposed by the 5th European Workshop in
   Periodontology (EWP5) and the collaboration between the US Centre for
   Diseases Control and Prevention and the American Academy of
   Periodontology (CDC-AAP).
   ResultsHundred percent and 91.2% of the subjects were classified as
   periodontitis cases according to the EWP5 and CDC-AAP protocols,
   respectively. Test-retest agreement was observed in 95% and 85% of the
   classified subjects according to the EWP5 and CDC-AAP protocols,
   respectively. The difference was statistically significant (P<0.01).
   Alignment of protocols, in terms of number of classification categories,
   resulted in a similar test-retest agreement of 95% using the EWP5
   protocol for extensive periodontitis and 90% using the CDC-AAP protocol
   for severe periodontitis (P=0.09). Misclassification was nondifferential
   when subjects were classified according either to the EWP5 or the
   aligned CDC-AAP protocols, while the reliability using the original
   CDC-AAP protocol depended on the extent of bleeding on probing, CAL 3mm
   and PD 4mm.
   ConclusionThis study suggests the EWP5 protocol is less error-prone than
   the CDC-AAP protocol in adult subjects with perceived need for
   periodontal treatment, as a result of intra-examiner less-than-perfect
   reliability of periodontal clinical parameters. Extensive or severe
   cases presented similar misclassification. Further studies using
   survey-like conditions are recommended to confirm these findings.

AB Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare repeatability and
   agreement of stromal bed thickness (SBT) measurements with
   intraoperative spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and
   ultrasound pachymetry (USP).
   Methods: The SBT was measured in 14 eyes of 14 patients during
   femtosecond laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK). Intraoperative SD-OCT
   was positioned on the eye to acquire images after creation of LASIK
   flaps. Patients were then asked to sit in front of a sweptsource optical
   coherence tomography (SS-OCT) for measurements. Subsequently, LASIK
   flaps were lifted and SBT was measured with USP. Three readings were
   obtained with each instrument. Repeatability of measurements was
   evaluated by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and
   reproducibility coefficient (RC).
   Results: ICC and RC values of SBT measurements were 0.98 and 8.7 mu m,
   0.99 and 7.1 mu m, and 0.99 and 6.9 mu m, respectively, for SDOCT,
   SS-OCT, and USP. There were no significant differences in the RC between
   the devices. The ICCs for agreement of SBT measurement were 0.97 between
   SD-OCT and SS-OCT, 0.8 between SD-OCT and USP, and 0.8 between SS-OCT
   and USP. The 95% limits of agreement of SBT measurements were -13.1 to
   8.8 mu m between SD-OCT and SS-OCT, -48.7 to 31.4 mu m between SDOCT and
   USP, and -42.8 to 29.8 mu m between SS-OCT and USP.
   Conclusions: SBT measurements obtained with intraoperative SD-OCT,
   SS-OCT, and USP were highly repeatable. Optical coherence tomography may
   be used as a potential noncontact device for corneal thickness
   assessment during LASIK. However, optical coherence tomography tends to
   underestimate the SBT compared with USP, and these measurements may not
   be used interchangeably.

AB BACKGROUND: Fecal incontinence is a clinical condition that causes
   embarrassment and changes the perception of quality of life. The absence
   of a specific tool for assessing fecal incontinence in children led us
   to adapt an instrument originally developed for adults, which has
   already been validated into Portuguese.
   OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this work was to evaluate the quality of life
   of children with fecal incontinence.
   DESIGN: This is a single-center, prospective study based on the
   application of survey. The Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life
   questionnaire was modified by eliminating 2 questions related to
   sexuality and by substituting the word "depressed" with "sad" in the
   statement, "I feel depressed."
   SETTING: The study took place at a tertiary academic medical center.
   PATIENTS: Forty-one children >5 years of age, with incontinence of
   organic etiology and preserved cognition but without stomy, were
   interviewed with the use of the Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life
   modified questionnaire. To evaluate the discrimination validity, 28
   healthy children were interviewed as control subjects.
   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: As to reproducibility, a test/retest was
   performed, involving 25 children. For construct validation, the Fecal
   Incontinence Quality of Life modified was correlated with the generic
   instrument Autoquestionnaire Qualite de Vie Enfant Image with the
   continence index Sao Paulo Score of Continence.
   RESULTS: The average values by scale included lifestyle, 3.1; emotional,
   2.8; behavior, 2.3; and embarrassment, 1.6. The average values for the
   control group included lifestyle, 3.7; emotional, 4.0; behavior, 3.6;
   and embarrassment, 3.6. The instrument showed a general reliability of
   0.78, measured by the Cronbach a. Reproducibility was also >0.90
   according to the Cronbach a.
   LIMITATIONS: The intrinsic characteristics of children include their
   constant growth, and this presented a challenge in our search for an
   instrument that permitted us to identify and measure these variations.
   CONCLUSIONS: The experiment showed a reduction in all of the scale
   values, particularly for embarrassment in children with fecal
   incontinence.

AB The reproducibility of an individual's full-field ERG between centres
   has not previously been investigated.
   ERGs were recorded using both silver thread and skin electrodes from the
   same two normal adult subjects at 15 UK centres using routine, local
   protocols and a highly standardised, 'ISCEV-specified' protocol matching
   the values specified in the ISCEV standard; where the ISCEV standard
   allows options, a single value was chosen.
   Inter-ocular differences were small, and amplitudes were smaller for
   skin than silver thread electrodes. No centre produced outlying data
   points, and ERGs across all 15 centres were remarkably similar.
   Amplitude variability was less for local protocols (using LED flashes)
   than for the ISCEV-specified protocol using xenon flashes (22 vs. 24 %,
   p = 0.01), but peak time variability was less for the ISCEV-specified
   protocol (6.1 vs. 7.4 %, p = 0.001). Only the DA 0.01 ERG correlated
   with photometric variability. The bifidity of the DA 3 a-wave doubled
   its peak time variability compared with the DA 10 a-wave.
   Inter-centre amplitude variability was typically within clinically
   significant thresholds, suggesting that inter-centre variability with
   suitable standardisation may not add more to total variability than
   inter-subject variability. Variability improvements gained by the
   tighter specifications of the ISCEV-specified protocol were possibly
   more than lost due to imprecisions of xenon flashtubes. Peak time
   variability was far lower than amplitude variability, corresponding with
   acceptable variability of biochemical assays. These results represent a
   vindication of the existence of an ERG standard and suggest that further
   standardisation would lend itself to greater reproducibility of ERGs
   worldwide.

   A. officinalis specimens collected in a natural reserve were divided

   g/m(3) benzene for 24 h. Three independent tests were performed to
   assess model reproducibility. Animals were dissected to obtain three
   pooled tissue samples per group: hepatopancreas (HEP), other organs and
   tissues (OOT), and exoskeleton (EXO). Muconic acid (MA),
   S-phenylmercapturic acid (S-PMA), two human metabolites of benzene, and
   changes in mtDNA copy number, a human biomarker of benzene exposure,
   were determined in each sample; benzene was determined only in EXO. MA
   was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with
   ultraviolet (UV) detection, S-PMA by triple quadrupole mass spectrometer
   liquid chromatography with electro spray ionization (LC-MS-ESI-TQD),
   mtDNA by real-time quantitative PCR and end-point PCR, and benzene by
   quadrupole mass spectrometer head-space gas chromatography (HSGC-MS).
   MA and S-PMA levels rose both in HEP and OOT; EXO exhibited increasing
   benzene concentrations; and mtDNA copy number rose in HEP but not in OUT
   samples. Overall, our findings demonstrate that A. officinalis is a
   sensitive bioindicator of air benzene exposure and show for the first
   time its ability to reproduce human metabolic dynamics. (C) 2015

   oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) of the child [the Early
   Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale (ECOHIS)], and the other on the
   socio-economic characteristics of the family. Statistical analyses were
   performed using the chi-square test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Mann-Whitney
   U-test, and Poisson regression. A total of 451 preschool children
   participated in the study. The majority of carious lesions exhibited
   severe decay (60.6%) and were found in both anterior (incisors/canines)
   and posterior (molars) teeth. The final Poisson model revealednegative
   impacts on quality of lifefrom more advanced stages of dental caries,
   both in incisors/canines and molars. Child's age and household income
   were also associated with impact on quality of life.Carious lesions in
   more advanced stages of progression in anterior and posterior teeth were
   associated with a negative impact on the quality of life of preschool
   children.

AB An ideal gene therapy vector should enable persistent transgene
   expression without limitations in safety and reproducibility. Recent
   researches' insight into the ability of chromosomal matrix attachment
   regions (MARs) to mediate episomal maintenance of genetic elements
   allowed the development of a circular episomal vector. Although a
   MAR-mediated engineered vector has been developed, little is known on
   which motifs of MAR confer this function during interaction with the
   host genome. Here, we report an artificially synthesized DNA fragment
   containing only characteristic motif sequences that served as an
   alternative to human beta-interferon matrix attachment region sequence.
   The potential of the vector to mediate gene transfer in CHO cells was
   investigated. The short synthetic MAR motifs were found to mediate
   episomal vector at a low copy number for many generations without
   integration into the host genome. Higher transgene expression was
   maintained for at least 4 months. In addition, MAR was maintained
   episomally and conferred sustained EGFP expression even in nonselective
   CHO cells. All the results demonstrated that MAR characteristic
   sequence-based vector can function as stable episomes in CHO cells,
   supporting long-term and effective transgene expression. (C) 2015

AB AimsEndometrial clear cell carcinomas (CCC) constitute fewer than 5% of
   all carcinomas of the endometrium. Currently, little is known regarding
   the genetic basis of endometrial CCC.
   Methods and resultsWe performed genomic and immunohistochemical analyses
   on 14 rigorously reviewed pure endometrial CCC. The genomic analysis
   consisted of sequencing the coding regions of 26 genes implicated
   previously in endometrial carcinoma. Twelve of 14 tumours displayed a
   prototypical CCC immunophenotype [napsin A+, hepatocyte nuclear factor-1
   (HNF1(+)) and oestrogen receptor(-)] and all showed intact mismatch
   repair protein expression. We detected mutations in 11 of 14 tumours,
   and there was a predominance of mutations involving genes that are
   mutated more frequently in endometrial serous carcinomas than in
   endometrioid carcinomas. Two tumours displayed a prototypical serous
   carcinoma mutation profile (concurrent TP53 and PPP2R1A mutations,
   without PTEN, CTNNB1 or ARID1A mutation). No mutations in PTEN, CTNNB1
   or POLE were identified.
   ConclusionsThe overall mutation profile of this cohort of endometrial
   CCC appears to be more serous-like than endometrioid-like, with a minor
   subset in the TP53-mutated CCC showing serous carcinoma profile. These
   findings provide new insights into the molecular features of
   morphologically prototypical endometrial CCC, and underscore the need
   for further investigations into the oncogenesis of endometrial CCC.

AB Soil microorganisms found in the root zone impact plant growth and
   development, but the potential to harness these benefits is hampered by
   the sheer abundance and diversity of the players influencing desirable
   plant traits. Here, we report a high level of reproducibility of soil
   microbiomes in altering plant flowering time and soil functions when
   partnered within and between plant hosts. We used a multi-generation
   experimental system using Arabidopsis thaliana Col to select for soil
   microbiomes inducing earlier or later flowering times of their hosts. We
   then inoculated the selected microbiomes from the tenth generation of
   plantings into the soils of three additional A. thaliana genotypes (Ler,
   Be, RLD) and a related crucifer (Brassica rapa). With the exception of
   Ler, all other plant hosts showed a shift in flowering time
   corresponding with the inoculation of early- or late-flowering
   microbiomes. Analysis of the soil microbial community using 16 S rRNA
   gene sequencing showed distinct microbiota profiles assembling by
   flowering time treatment. Plant hosts grown with the
   late-flowering-associated microbiomes showed consequent increases in
   inflorescence biomass for three A. thaliana genotypes and an increase in
   total biomass for B. rapa. The increase in biomass was correlated with
   two-to five-fold enhancement of microbial extracellular enzyme
   activities associated with nitrogen mineralization in soils. The
   reproducibility of the flowering phenotype across plant hosts suggests
   that microbiomes can be selected to modify plant traits and coordinate
   changes in soil resource pools.

AB The chlorination reaction kinetics of Zircaloy-4 cladding hulls were
   investigated using a home-made thermogravimetric analysis for a hull
   chlorination (TGA-HC) system. The reproducibility of the TGA-HC system
   was verified by repeated measurements at an identical condition, which
   showed only 6.6% of maximum difference. The effect of total flow rate
   (Q) was investigated for Q of 120 and 240 mL/min, and it was revealed
   that the reaction rate is not influenced in this condition. Using the
   Sharp Hancock plot, the volumetric contraction model was identified as
   the most suitable model for the Zircaloy-4 chlorination reaction. The
   influence of chlorine partial pressure was studied at 9.21, 16.9, and
   23.4 kPa of Cl-2 partial pressure conditions, and it was identified that
   the reaction rate is proportional to the chlorine partial pressure on
   the order of (0.669). The effect of reaction temperature was
   investigated for 300-450 degrees C, and it was revealed that the
   chlorination reaction exhibits an activation energy of 26.2 kJ/mol.
   Using the experimental and fitting results, the reaction rate equation
   for the Zircaloy-4 chlorination reaction was achieved, but the equation
   was valid only until the conversion fraction (alpha) reaches up to
   (0.60). When alpha is higher than 0.60, the volumetric contraction model
   was not applicable. A second-order reaction rate equation was suggested
   for the 0.6 < alpha region, although it needs further investigation. (C)

AB Purpose: The purpose of the present study was to develop a
   computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM)
   technique that enabled fabrication of surgical cutting guides and
   titanium fixation plates that would allow the upper maxilla to be
   repositioned correctly without a surgical splint in orthognathic
   patients.
   Materials and Methods: Ten patients were recruited. A complete CAD-CAM
   workflow for orthognathic surgery has 3 steps: 1) virtual planning of
   the surgical treatment, 2) CAD-CAM and 3-dimensional printing of
   customized surgical devices (surgical cutting guide and titanium
   fixation plates), and 3) computer-aided surgery. Upper maxilla
   repositioning was performed in a waferless manner using a CAD-CAM
   device: the surgical cutting guide was used during surgery to pilot the
   osteotomy line that had been planned preoperatively at the computer and
   the custom-made fixation titanium plates allowed desired repositioning
   of the maxilla.
   Results: To evaluate the reproducibility of this CAD-CAM orthognathic
   surgical method, the virtually planned and actually achieved positions
   of the upper maxilla were compared. Overlap errors using a threshold
   value smaller than 2 mm were evaluated, and the frequency of such errors
   was used as a measurement of accuracy. By this definition, the accuracy
   was 100% in 7 patients (range in all patients, 62 to 100%; median,
   92.7%).
   Conclusion: These results tend to confirm that the use of CAD-CAM
   cutting guides and customized titanium plates for upper maxilla

AB Nano-Ag particles were coated with colloidal carbon (Ag@C) to improve
   its biocompatibility and chemical stability for the preparation of
   biosensor. The core-shell structure was evidenced by transmission
   electron microscope (TEM) and the Fourier transfer infrared (FTIR)
   spectra revealed that the carbon shell is rich of function groups such
   as OH and COOH. The as-prepared Ag@C core-shell structure can offer
   favorable microenvironment for immobilizing glucose oxidase and the
   direct electrochemistry process of glucose oxidase (GOD) at Ag@C
   modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was realized. The modified
   electrode exhibited good response to glucose. Under optimum experimental
   conditions the biosensor linearly responded to glucose concentration in
   the range of 0.05-2.5 mM, with a detection limit of 0.02 mM (S/N = 3).
   The apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (K-M(app)) of the biosensor is
   calculated to be 1.7 mM, suggesting high enzymatic activity and affinity
   toward glucose. In addition, the GOD-Ag@C/Nafion/GCE shows good
   reproducibility and long-term stability. These results suggested that
   core-shell structured Ag@C is an ideal matrix for the immobilization of
   the redox enzymes and further the construction of the sensitive enzyme
   biosensor. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sensors incorporating molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are feasible
   in concept though the reproducibility of such devices can be compromised
   by the large number of interdependent steps. For this reason, many
   researchers have focused on the synthesis of MIP particles only, not on
   their immobilization. Herein is presented a sol-gel based method for
   immobilization of unmodified MIP particles for use in an electrochemical
   sensor. The macroporous particles were prepared using
   precipitation-polymerization and imprinted with theophylline. The
   sol-gel was combined with graphite microparticles (50 mu m) and the
   composite was deposited on the surfaced of an epoxy-graphite electrode.
   The sensor was then tested for its response to theophylline using
   differential pulse voltammetry. A limit of detection of 1 mu M was
   observed and a relative standard deviation of 6.85 %. The electrode can
   be regenerated via a thermal washing process which was accompanied by an
   initial signal loss of 29.3 %. Any further regeneration caused a signal
   loss of 2.4 % only.

   much stronger than the one of TiO2 nanoparticles having smooth surfaces.
   It was used to label the secondary antibody in a sandwich immunoassay. A
   thin layer of metallic gold (Au) and palladium (Pd) was deposited on an
   indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode by code-position at a potential of 0.2
   V in the respective chloride solutions. The Au/Pd-modified ITO electrode
   showed good conductivity. An ECL based immunoassay for the prostate

   antibody on the Au/Pd layer on the ITO electrode, then exposing the
   electrode to a sample containing PSA, then forming the sandwich with the
   fl-TiO2 labeled secondary antibody, and finally measuring the intensity
   of ECL at a potential of -1.5 V. This ECL sensor has a response range
   that extends from 0.001 to 600 nga (TM) mL(-1), a lower detection limit
   of 0.32 pga (TM) mL(-1), good specificity, acceptable stability and good

   It possesses a three-dimensional nanospongy architecture with a typical

   towards oxidation of nitrite in phosphate buffer of pH 7.0 at a working
   voltage of 1.2 V (vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode). Compared to
   np-Pd and a commercial Pd/C catalyst, the np-PdFe alloy exhibits
   superior detection capability such as a wide linear range (that extends
   from 0.5 to 25.5 mM), fast amperometric response (within 2 s), and a low
   detection limit (0.8 mu M). Long-term tests demonstrate that the np-PdFe
   alloy has improved reproducibility and durability, with almost no

   method was applied to determine nitrite in sausage and the results are
   in good agreement with those of the Griess method.

AB Understanding the molecular organization of the maize B-chromosome is
   hindered by its high homology with A-chromosomes. Recently, various
   approaches have been employed to overcome this hindrance, and several
   B-chromosome-specific sequences have been identified. Here, we cloned
   and characterized four previously published B-chromosome-specific RAPD
   fragments in detail. The results of sequence analysis, Southern
   hybridization and fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that the
   four RAPD fragments are repetitive and present on both the B- and
   A-chromosomes, which supports an A-chromosome origin of the
   B-chromosome. We further developed four sequence-characterized amplified
   region (SCAR) markers derived from the four B-chromosome-specific RAPDs.
   These markers amplified PCR products exclusively in plants with
   B-chromosomes and were further mapped to definite distal heterochromatic
   regions of the B-chromosome by 15 B-A translocations. Furthermore,
   reverse transcriptase-PCR revealed that two of the four
   B-chromosome-specific RAPD fragments are transcriptionally active. These
   results demonstrate the feasibility of using B-chromosome-specific RAPD
   sequences to generate SCAR markers specific to the B-chromosome and
   might apply to other sequences of the maize B-chromosome.

   was fabricated on glass substrate using simple and cost effective drop
   casting method. The gas sensing performance of sensor was studied for
   various toxic/flammable analytes like NO2, C2H5OH, CH3OH, H2S and NH3.
   The sensor shows higher selectivity towards NO2 gas with 72% response at
   100 ppm. Also the sensor can successfully detect low concentration of
   NO2 gas upto 5 ppm with reasonable response of 12%. Structural,
   morphological and compositional analyses evidenced the successful
   formation of DBSA doped PPy-WO3 hybrid nanocomposite with uniform
   dispersion of DBSA into PPy-WO3 hybrid nanocomposite and enhance the gas
   sensing behavior. We demonstrated that DBSA doped PPy-WO3 hybrid
   nanocomposite sensor films shows excellent reproducibility, high
   stability, moderate response and recovery time for NO2 gas in the
   concentration range of 5-100 ppm. A gas sensing mechanism based on the
   formation of random nano p-n junctions distributed over the surface of
   the sensor film has been proposed. In addition modulation of depletion
   width takes place in sensor on interaction with the target NO2 gas has
   been depicted on the basis of schematic energy band diagram. Impedance
   spectroscopy was employed to study bulk, grain boundary resistance and
   capacitance before and after exposure of NO2 gas. The structural and
   intermolecular interaction within the hybrid nanocomposites were
   explored by Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), while
   field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was used to
   characterize surface morphology. The present method can be extended to
   fabricate other organic dopent-conducting polymer-metal oxide hybrid

AB Background: Recent concerns have been raised by neurologists and
   patients with epilepsy regarding the bioequivalence of generic
   lamotrigine to the brand Lamictal. Bioequivalence studies require the
   quantification of lamotrigine in human plasma, including in the presence
   of other drugs, for studies that will use patients with epilepsy rather
   than healthy volunteers.
   Methods: Lamotrigine was extracted from plasma through a simple protein
   precipitation and analyzed by fast liquid chromatography coupled to
   heated electrospray ionization with tandem mass spectrometric detection.
   A backflush step to remove interferent accumulation on column was
   included, and a stable isotope-labeled lamotrigine was used as an
   internal standard. The method was validated for accuracy, precision,
   interday and intraday coefficient of variation, specificity, lower limit
   of detection, lower limit of quantification, linearity, range,
   instrument precision, freeze-thaw, dilution integrity, and sample
   stability. Specificity evaluation included consideration of the impact
   of other antiepileptic drugs.
   Results: The described method has a linear range of 8-10,000 ng/mL of
   lamotrigine (r(2) = 0.9999) and a lower limit of detection of 1 ng/mL
   and a lower limit of quantification of 8 ng/mL. Intraday and interday
   reproducibility were less than 10.0% relative SD and 10.4% relative SD,
   respectively, and the percent recovery varied from 96.6% to 109.3% at
   various lamotrigine concentrations. A backflush step reduced matrix
   effects and no interference peak from plasma or other antiepileptic
   drugs were observed.
   Conclusions: A liquid chromatography-heated electrospray
   ionization-tandem mass spectrometry method including a backflush step
   was developed and validated to measure lamotrigine concentration in
   patient plasma. The method will be applied to bioequivalence studies
   that compare brand versus generic lamotrigine.

AB Background Proprioception can be assessed by measuring joint position
   sense (JPS). Most studies have focused on JPS of the knee joint while
   literature for other joints especially for hip JPS is scarce. Although
   some studies have evaluated proprioception of the knee joint, the
   reproducibility of methods has rarely been investigated.
   Aims To estimate intrasession reliability and agreement of an
   active-active JPS test for hip flexion/abduction and knee flexion in
   healthy older adults.
   Methods Nineteen healthy older adults participated in this study. The
   proprioception of the hip (flexion and abduction) and knee (flexion)
   were assessed in both legs using the "active-active" reproduction
   technique. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), standard error of
   measurement (SEM), and limits of agreement (LOA) were estimated for
   relative angular error (RE), absolute angular error (AE), and variable
   angular error (VE).
   Results Reliability of our JPS test was substantial to almost perfect
   for the RE for both joints and legs (ICC values ranging from 0.75 to
   0.93). We also found that the ICC values for AE were substantial for
   knee flexion and hip abduction of the left and right leg. The ICC
   results of VE showed poor reliability for hip and knee joints. SEM and
   LOA values for hip abduction were generally lower than for hip and knee
   flexion, indicating lower measurement error or more precise scores for
   the proprioception test of hip abduction.
   Conclusion(s) Proprioceptive acuity of the knee and hip joints in
   healthy older adults can be reliably assessed with an active-active
   procedure in a standing position with respect to relative and absolute
   error.

AB Objective: Three-dimensional (3-D) visualization and quantification of
   vascular calcification (VC) are important to accelerate the
   multidisciplinary investigation of VC. Agatston scoring is the standard
   approach for evaluating coronary artery calcification. However,
   regarding aortic calcification (AC), quantification methods appear to
   vary among studies. The aim of this study was to introduce a simple
   technique of simultaneous quantification and 3-D visualization of AC and
   provide validation data. Methods: The main study comprised of 126
   patients who underwent the thoracoabdominal plain computed tomography
   scan as preoperative general evaluation. AC was quantified using a
   volume-rendering (VR) method (VR AC volume) by extracting the volume
   with a density >= 130 HU within the total aorta. The concordance and
   reproducibility of the VR AC volume were validated in comparison with
   the conventional slice-by-slice voxel-based AC quantification
   (volumetric AC score) using the Agatston scoring software. Results:
   Excellent concordance between the VR AC volume and volumetric AC score
   was confirmed (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.9997, mean
   difference = -0.05 +/- 0.23 mL, p < 0.0001). Excellent intraobserver and
   interobserver reliabilities were demonstrated using the Bland -Altman
   analysis as the mean intraobserver difference was 0.00 mL (p = 0.9863)
   and the mean interobserver difference was -0.01 mL (p = 0.6612).
   Conclusion: The VR method was validated to be feasible. This simple
   approach could overcome the limitation of the current method based on
   slice-by-slice pixel or voxel summation, which lacks 3-D visual
   information. Accordingly, this approach would be promising for
   accelerating the investigation of VC. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

AB BACKGROUND & AIMS: Transient elastometry is a noninvasive procedure used
   to measure fibrosis when patients are diagnosed with liver disease; it
   might be used to monitor changes over time. We investigated whether
   there are short-term variations in stiffness measurements that are not
   attributable to changes in fibrosis by studying patients with stable
   liver disease.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 531 paired liver
   stiffness measurements made by Fibroscan when the study began (LSM1) and
   at follow-up (LSM2), more than 1 day and less than 1 year apart, from
   432 stable (for body mass index, waist circumference, and alcohol
   consumption), untreated, immunocompetent patients with chronic liver
   disease (from January 2006 through March 2009). Variations between the
   first and follow-up measurements were expressed as absolute (LSM2-LSM1,
   kPa) or relative ([LSM2-LSM1]/LSM1*100) or as changes in fibrosis stage.
   RESULTS: There was >20% variation in 49.7%, >30% in 34.3%, and >50% in
   12.2% of paired measurements; this variation was constant across the
   spectrum of LSM1 values. The variations produced a 1-fibrosis stage
   difference in 31.5% of pairs and a >= 2-stage difference in 9.8% of
   pairs. Patients with LSM1 >7 kPa had increased probability of having a
   different stage of fibrosis at LSM2, compared with patients with LSM1 <7
   kPa. Factors associated with variation included measurements made by 2
   different operators or at least 1 non-senior operator, ratios of
   interquartile range: median values, significant fibrosis (>= 7 kPa) at
   LSM1, baseline body mass index, or a 2-fold difference in level of
   alanine aminotransferase between measurements. When the analyses were
   restricted to measurements made by the same operator, the variation was
   slightly reduced; fibrosis stage differed between measurements for only
   34.3% of cases.
   CONCLUSIONS: Operator-related and patient-related factors produce
   significant variations in liver stiffness measurements made by transient
   elastometry, limiting its use in monitoring patients. These variations
   are unrelated to disease progression. The lowest levels of variation
   occur in measurements made in patients with no or early-stage fibrosis
   or by a single experienced operator.

AB AimThe aim of the study was to determine the best measure to
   discriminate between those with oropharyngeal dysphagia (OPD) and those
   without OPD, among young children with cerebral palsy (CP).
   MethodWe carried out a cross-sectional population-based study involving
   130 children with CP aged between 18 months and 36 months (mean 27.4mo;
   81 males, 49 females) classified according to the Gross Motor Function
   Classification Scale (GMFCS) as level I (n=57), II (n=15), III (n=23),
   IV (n=12), or V (n=23). Forty children with CP (mean 28.5mo; 21 males,19
   females, eight for each GMFCS level) were included in the
   reproducibility sub-study, and 40 children with typical development
   (mean 26.2mo; 18 males, 22 females) were included in the validity
   sub-study. OPD was assessed using the Dysphagia Disorders Survey (DDS),
   Pre-Speech Assessment Scale (PSAS), and Schedule for Oral Motor
   Assessment (SOMA). We analysed reproducibility using inter- and
   intrarater agreement (percentage) and reliability (kappa values and
   intraclass correlation coefficients). Construct validity was assessed as
   concordance between measures (SOMA, DDS, and PSAS). In the absence of a
   criterion standard measure for OPD, prevalence was estimated using
   latent class variable analysis. Data from the children with typical
   development were used to propose modified OPD cut-points for
   discriminative validity.
   ResultsAll measures had strong agreement (>85%) for inter- and
   intrarater reliability. The SOMA had the best specificity (100.0%), but
   lacked sensitivity (53.0%), whereas the DDS and PSAS had high
   sensitivity (each 100.0%) but lacked specificity (47.1% and 70.6%
   respectively). OPD prevalence when calculated using the web-based
   estimation was 65.4%, which was similar to the estimate from the
   modified cut-points.
   InterpretationUsing the sample of children with typical development and
   modified cut-points, OPD prevalence was lower than estimates with
   standard scoring. We propose using these modified cut-points when
   administering the DDS, PSAS or SOMA in young children with CP.
   What this paper adds
   <list list-type="bulleted" id="dmcn12616-list-0001"> The Dysphagia
   Disorders Survey (DDS) and Pre-Speech Assessment Scale (PSAS) had high
   sensitivity in detecting oropharyngeal dysphagia (OPD), but low
   specificity. In contrast, the Schedule for Oral Motor Assessment (SOMA)
   had high specificity, but low sensitivity. OPD prevalence is
   approximately 65% when using web-based estimation methods, and with
   modified OPD cut-points. Modified cut-points should be used for
   classifying OPD on the DDS, PSAS, and SOMA in young children with CP.
   This will improve the specificity of the measures. DDS, PSAS, and SOMA
   had strong inter- and intrarater reproducibility.

AB In this work, we designed a novel and ultrasensitive sandwich-type
   electrochemical immunosensor for quantitative detection of
   alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), using beta-cyclodextrin functionalized graphene
   (CD-GS) as the platform and platinum hybrid multiwalled carbon nanotubes
   adhered copper oxide (Pt@CuO-MWCNTs) as labels. CD-GS has high specific
   surface area, ideal dispersibility and good biocompatibility, which was
   used to efficiently capture more primary antibodies (Ab(1)). Pt, CuO and
   multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) can be used as catalysts for the
   decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. The Pt@CuO-MWCNTs realized multiple
   amplified signals due to their synergy. Therefore, Pt@CuO-MWCNTswas used
   as the marker, combined with secondary antibodies (Ab(2)) and this has
   the effect of multiple amplified signals to catalyze hydrogen peroxide.
   Under optimal conditions the designed immunosensor exhibited a wide
   linear range from 1 pgmL (1) to 20 ngmL (1) with a low detection limit
   of 0.33 pgmL (1) (S/N = 3) for AFP. The designed immunosensor showed
   good selectivity, reproducibility and stability, which could provide
   potential applications in clinical monitoring of AFP. (C) 2015 Elsevier

AB Heart rate variability (HRV) is often monitored in occupational studies
   as a measure of cardiac autonomic activation, but the reliability of
   commonly used HRV indices is poorly understood. In the present study, we
   determined the variability between and within subjects of common HRV
   indices during a repetitive low-force occupational task, i.e.,
   pipetting, and interpreted the results in terms of necessary sample
   sizes in studies comparing HRV between conditions or groups.
   Fourteen healthy female subjects performed a standardized pipetting task
   in the laboratory on three separate days within a short-time span (< 2
   weeks), and on one additional occasion 6 months later. A number of
   standard HRV indices were calculated in both time and frequency domains.
   For each HRV index, variance components were estimated between subjects,
   within subjects between occasions far apart in time, and within subjects
   between days within a 2-week period.
   We found that the time interval between repeated measurements did not
   influence the extent of HRV variability, and that the reliability of the
   most HRV indices was sufficient for even small study samples (30
   subjects or less) to be able to detect, with satisfying power (> 0.80),
   a significant 10 to 20 % difference in HRV between groups, and between
   conditions within individuals.
   We conclude that HRV can be used as a reliable and feasible marker of
   autonomic activity in occupational studies of repetitive low-force work.

AB Barrett's esophagus is the only known precursor that predisposes
   patients to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma. The current
   recommended surveillance method is targeted biopsies of any
   abnormalities followed by random four-quadrant biopsies every 2 cm using
   standard white light endoscopy. Compliance with this and sampling error
   are two of the biggest problems. Several novel imaging technologies have
   been developed to aid the diagnosis of early neoplasia in Barrett's
   esophagus. There are emerging data that some of these new modalities can
   increase the yield of detecting dysplasia. This review will discuss some
   of the present available techniques and technologies including
   chromoendoscopy, narrow-band imaging, autofluorescence imaging, optical
   coherence tomography, confocal endomicroscopy and endocytoscopy. Based
   on the current evidence, these imaging modalities appear to be promising
   as adjunctive tools to white light endoscopy. A few of them,
   nevertheless, remain experimental due to expense, lack of expertise,
   generalizability as well as reproducibility of results.

AB Guidelines promote the use of adrenal vein sampling (AVS) to document
   lateralized aldosterone hypersecretion in primary aldosteronism.
   However, there are large discrepancies between institutions in the
   criteria used to interpret its results. This study evaluates the
   consequences of these differences on the classification and management
   of patients. The results of all 537 AVS procedures performed between
   January 2001 and July 2010 in our institution were interpreted with 4
   diagnostic criteria used in experienced institutions where AVS is
   performed without cosyntropin (Brisbane, Padua, Paris, and Turin) and
   with criteria proposed by a recent consensus statement. AVS procedures
   were classified as unsuccessful, lateralized, or not lateralized
   according to each set of criteria. Almost 5x more AVS procedures were
   classified as unsuccessful with the strictest criteria than with the
   least strict criteria (18% versus 4%, respectively). Similarly, over 2x
   more AVS procedures were classified as lateralized with the least
   stringent criteria than with the most stringent criteria (60% versus
   26%, respectively). Multiple samples were available from >= 1 side for
   155 AVS procedures. These procedures were classified differently by >= 2
   right-left sample pairs in 12% to 20% of cases. Thus, different sets of
   criteria used to interpret AVS in experienced institutions translate
   into heterogeneous classifications and hence management decisions, for
   patients with primary aldosteronism. Defining the most appropriate
   procedures and diagnostic criteria is needed for AVS to achieve optimal
   performance and fully justify its status as a gold standard.

PY 2015
AB Nonunion fractures occur frequently in humans, with profound
   implications (medical and non-medical). Although there are numerous
   animal models to study pathogenesis and treatment of nonunion fractures,
   there is apparently the lack of a definitive model for atrophic nonunion
   fracture. Therefore, the objective was to develop a low-cost rat model
   of nonunion fracture with a vascular deficit that enabled standardized
   quantitative analysis of bone growth and regeneration. The model was
   developed with two surgeries, performed apart. The first involved
   osteotomy of the femur diaphysis, removal of periosteum and endosteum,
   isolation of the fracture site using a latex artefact (Penrose drain
   tube), and reduction of the fracture using an intramedullary pin,
   whereas the second surgery was to remove the latex artefact. Based on
   radiographic imaging, micro-CT and histological analyses done 125 days
   after the fracture was induced, there was clear evidence of atrophic
   nonunion fracture, without pin migration or specimen loss. Perceived
   advantages of this model included low cost, ease of reproducibility,
   lack of specimen loss, and, finally, the potential to assess bone growth
   and regeneration under poor vascular conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

PD APR 2015
PY 2015
AB Background Due to high melanoma immunogenicity, germline genetic
   variants in immune pathways have been studied for association with
   melanoma prognosis. However, limited candidate selection, inadequate
   power, or lack of independent validation have hampered the
   reproducibility of these prior findings, preventing personalised
   clinical applicability in melanoma prognostication. Our objective was to
   assess the prognostic utility of genetic variants in immunomodulatory
   pathways for prediction of melanoma clinical outcomes.
   Methods We genotyped 72 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 44
   immunomodulatory genes in a population sample of 1022 melanoma patients
   and performed Cox regression analysis to test the association between
   SNPs and melanoma recurrence-free (RFS) and overall survival (OS). We
   have further investigated the most significant associations using a fine
   mapping strategy and followed with functional analyses in CD4+ T cells
   in a subset of 75 melanoma patients.
   Results The most significant associations were found with melanoma OS
   for rs3024493 in IL10 at chromosome 1q32.1 (heterozygous HR 0.58, 95% CI
   0.39 to 0.86; p=0.0006), a variant previously shown to be linked with
   autoimmune conditions. Multiple additional SNPs at 1q32.1 were also
   nominally associated with OS confirming at least two independent
   association signals in this locus. In addition, we found rs3024493
   associated with the downregulation of interleukin 10 (IL10) secretion in
   CD4+ T cells.
   Conclusions We discovered novel associations of IL10 with melanoma
   survival at 1q32.1, suggesting this locus should be considered as a
   novel melanoma prognostic biomarker with potential for aiding melanoma
   patient management. Our findings also provide further support for an
   alternative role of IL10 in stimulation of antitumour immune response.

PD APR 2015

AB Some multiple-point-based sampling algorithms, such as the snesim
   algorithm, rely on sequential simulation. The conditional probability
   distributions that are used for the simulation are based on statistics
   of multiple-point data events obtained from a training image. During the
   simulation, data events with zero probability in the training image
   statistics may occur. This is handled by pruning the set of conditioning
   data until an event with non-zero probability is found. The resulting
   probability distribution sampled by such algorithms is a pruned mixture
   model. The pruning strategy leads to a probability distribution that
   lacks some of the information provided by the multiple-point statistics
   from the training image, which reduces the reproducibility of the
   training image patterns in the outcome realizations. When pruned mixture
   models are used as prior models for inverse problems, local
   re-simulations are performed to obtain perturbed realizations.
   Consequently, these local re-simulations lead to additional pruning in
   the set of conditioning data, which further deteriorates the pattern
   reproduction. To mitigate this problem, it is here suggested to combine
   the pruned mixture model with a frequency matching model. The
   multiple-point statistics of outcome realizations from this combined
   model has improved degree of match with the statistics from the training
   image. An efficient algorithm that samples this combined model is
   suggested. Finally, a tomographic cross-borehole inverse problem with
   prior information expressed by the combined (prior) model is used to
   demonstrate the effect of pattern reproducibility on the resolution of
   an inverse problem.

AB Our main objective was to evaluate the repeatability and reproducibility
   of optic radiation (OR) reconstruction from diffusion MRI (dMRI) data.
   14 adults were scanned twice with the same 60-direction dMRI sequence.
   Peaks in the diffusion profile were estimated with the single tensor
   (ST), Q-ball (QSH) and persistent angular structure (PAS) methods.
   Segmentation of the OR was performed by two experimenters with
   probabilistic tractography based on a manually drawn region-of-interest
   (ROI) protocol typically employed for OR segmentation, with both
   standard and extended sets of ROIs. The repeatability and
   reproducibility were assessed by calculating the intra-class correlation
   coefficient (ICC) of intra-and inter-rater experiments, respectively.
   ICCs were calculated for commonly used dMRI metrics (FA, MD, AD, RD) and
   anatomical dimensions of the optic radiation (distance from Meyer's loop
   to the temporal pole, ML-TP), as well as the Dice similarity coefficient
   (DSC) between the raters' OR segmentation. Bland-Altman plots were also
   calculated to investigate bias and variability in the reproducibility
   measurements.
   The OR was successfully reconstructed in all subjects by both raters.
   The ICC was found to be in the good to excellent range for both
   repeatability and reproducibility of the dMRI metrics, DSC and ML-TP
   distance. The Bland-Altman plots did not show any apparent systematic
   bias for any quantities.
   Overall, higher ICC values were found for the multi-fiber methods, QSH
   and PAS, and for the standard set of ROIs. Considering the good to
   excellent repeatability and reproducibility of all the quantities
   investigated, these findings support the use of multi-fiber OR
   reconstruction with a limited number of manually drawn ROIs in clinical
   applications utilizing either OR microstructure characterization or OR
   dimensions, as is the case in neurosurgical planning for temporal

PD APR 2015
PY 2015
AB Diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) measures the diffusion and kurtosis
   tensors to quantify restricted, non-Gaussian diffusion that occurs in
   biological tissue. By estimating the kurtosis tensor, DKI accounts for
   higher order diffusion dynamics, when compared with diffusion tensor
   imaging (DTI), and consequently can describe more complex diffusion
   profiles. Here, we compare several measures of diffusional anisotropy
   which incorporate information from the kurtosis tensor, including
   kurtosis fractional anisotropy (KFA) and generalized fractional
   anisotropy (GFA), with the diffusion tensor-derived fractional
   anisotropy (FA). KFA and GFA demonstrate a net enhancement relative to
   FA when multiple white matter fiber bundle orientations are present in
   both simulated and human data. In addition, KFA shows net enhancement in
   deep brain structures, such as the thalamus and the lenticular nucleus,
   where FA indicates low anisotropy. Thus, KFA and GFA provide additional
   information relative to FA with regard to diffusional anisotropy, and
   may be particularly advantageous for the assessment of diffusion in
   complex tissue environments. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The purpose of this work was to assess the reproducibility of diffusion
   imaging, and in particular the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC),
   intra-voxel incoherent motion (IVIM) parameters and diffusion tensor
   imaging (DTI) parameters, across multiple centres using clinically
   available protocols with limited harmonization between sequences.
   An ice-water phantom and nine healthy volunteers were scanned across
   fives centres on eight scanners (four Siemens 1.5T, four Philips 3T).
   The mean ADC, IVIM parameters (diffusion coefficient D and perfusion
   fraction f) and DTI parameters (mean diffusivity MD and fractional
   anisotropy FA), were measured in grey matter, white matter and specific
   brain sub-regions. A mixed effect model was used to measure the
   intra-and inter-scanner coefficient of variation (CV) for each of the
   five parameters.
   ADC, D, MD and FA had a good intra-and inter-scanner reproducibility in
   both grey and white matter, with a CV ranging between 1% and 7.4%; mean
   2.6%. Other brain regions also showed high levels of reproducibility
   except for small structures such as the choroid plexus. The IVIM
   parameter f had a higher intra-scanner CV of 8.4% and inter-scanner CV
   of 24.8%. No major difference in the inter-scanner CV for ADC, D, MD and
   FA was observed when analysing the 1.5T and 3T scanners separately.
   ADC, D, MD and FA all showed good intra-scanner reproducibility, with
   the inter-scanner reproducibility being comparable or faring slightly
   worse, suggesting that using data from multiple scanners does not have
   an adverse effect compared with using data from the same scanner. The
   IVIM parameter f had a poorer inter-scanner CV when scanners of
   different field strengths were combined, and the parameter was also
   affected by the scan acquisition resolution. This study shows that the
   majority of diffusion MRI derived parameters are robust across 1.5T and
   3T scanners and suitable for use in multi-centre clinical studies and
   trials. (C) 2015 The Authors NMR in Biomedicine Published by John Wiley

   inter-individual differences. However, it is still unknown whether
   individual subjects react in a similar way when repeatedly exposed.
   Thus, our study aimed to investigate inter-individual variation and
   intra-individual stability of field effects. To do so, we exposed 20
   young male subjects twice for 30min prior to sleep to the same amplitude
   modulated 900MHz (2Hz pulse, 20Hz Gaussian low-pass filter and a ratio
   of peak-to-average of 4) RF EMF (spatial peak absorption of 2W/kg

   power during all-night non-rapid eye movement sleep revealed: (1)
   exposure-related increases in delta-theta frequency range in several
   fronto-central electrodes; and (2) no differences in spindle frequency
   range. We did not observe reproducible within-subject RF EMF effects on
   sleep spindle and delta-theta activity in the sleep EEG and it remains
   unclear whether a biological trait of how the subjects' brains react to
   RF EMF exists. Bioelectromagnetics. 36:169-177, 2015.  2015 Wiley

   clinical impact, novel in vitro diagnostic markers promise to have a
   substantial effect on healthcare costs. Although numerous publications
   report the discovery of biomarkers, only a fraction of those markers are
   routinely used. One key challenge is a measurement system that is
   compatible with clinical workflows.
   METHODS: We designed a new immunoassay for microRNA (miRNA)
   quantification. The assay combines streptavidin-linked microparticles, a
   biotinylated catcher oligonucleotide complementary to a single miRNA
   species, and finally, a monoclonal antibody to DNA/RNA heterohybrids
   labeled with acridinium ester. Importantly, our assay runs on standard
   immunoassay analyzers. After a technical validation of the assay, we
   evaluated the clinical performance on 4 Alzheimer disease miRNAs.
   RESULTS: Our assay has an analytical specificity of 99.4% and is at the
   same time sensitive (concentrations in the range of 1 pmol/L miRNA can
   be reliably profiled). Because the novel approach did not require
   amplification steps, we obtained high reproducibility for up to 40
   biological replicates. Importantly, our assay prototype exhibited a time
   to result of <3 h. With human blood samples, the assay was able to
   measure 4 miRNAs that can detect Alzheimer disease with a diagnostic
   accuracy of 82% and showed a Pearson correlation >0.994 with the gold
   standard qRT-PCR.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our miRNA immunoassay allowed the measurement of miRNA
   signatures with sufficient analytical sensitivity and high specificity
   on commonly available laboratory equipment.

AB Meth ods involving polyoxymethylene (POM) as a passive sampler are
   increasing in popularity to assess contaminant freely dissolved
   porewater concentrations in soils and sediments. These methods require
   contaminant-specific POM-water partition coefficients, KPOM . Certain
   methods for determining KPOM perform reproducibly (within 0.2 log
   units). However, other methods can give highly varying KPOM values (up
   to 2 log units), especially for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).
   To account for this variation, the authors tested the influence of key
   methodological components in KPOM determinations, including POM
   thickness, extraction procedures, and environmental temperature and
   salinity, as well as uptake kinetics in mixed and static systems. All
   inconsistencies in the peer-reviewed literature can be accounted for by
   the likelihood that thick POM materials (500mum or thicker) do not
   achieve equilibrium (causing negative biases up to 1 log unit), or that
   certain POM extraction procedures do not ensure quantitative extraction
   (causing negative biases up to 2 log units). Temperature can also
   influence KPOM , although all previous literature studies were carried
   out at room temperature. The present study found that KPOM values at
   room temperature are independent (within 0.2 log units) of POM
   manufacture method, of thickness between 17mum and 80mum, and of
   salinity between 0% and 10%. Regarding kinetics, monochloro- to
   hexachloro-polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were within 0.2 log units of
   equilibrium after 28d in the mixed system, but only dichloro-PCBs
   achieved near equilibrium after 126d in the static system. Based on
   these insights, recommended methods and KPOM values to facilitate
   interlaboratory reproducibility are presented. Environ Toxicol Chem

AB OBJECTIVES: In acute type B aortic dissection (ABAD) a patent false
   lumen portends a poor outcome. Patent branch vessels originating from
   the false lumen in a type B aortic dissection are assumed to contribute
   to persistent blood flow and patent false lumen. Therefore, the
   morphologic changes of the false lumen generated by different outflow
   rates in an invitro model were investigated.
   METHODS: An artificial dissection was created in two exvivo porcine
   aortas. A thin cannula was placed in the false lumen, simulating a
   branch vessel originating from it. The aorta was positioned in a
   validated invitro circulatory system with physiological pulsatile flow
   (1,500-2,700mL/minute) and pressure characteristics (130/70mmHg). The
   cannula was attached to a small silicone tube with an adjustable valve
   mechanism. Three different valve settings were used for creating outflow
   from the false lumen (fully closed, opened at 50%, and fully opened at
   100%). Measurements of lumen areas and flow rates were assessed with
   time-resolved magnetic resonance imaging. In order to study
   reproducibility, the experiment was performed twice in two different
   porcine aortas with a similar morphology.
   RESULTS: Increasing antegrade outflow through the branch vessel of the
   false lumen resulted in a significant (p<.01) increase of the mean false
   lumen area at the proximal and distal location in both models. The
   distal false lumen expanded up to 107% in the case of high outflow via
   the false lumen through the branch vessel.
   CONCLUSIONS: Increasing antegrade outflow through a branch vessel
   originating from the false lumen when no distal re-entry tear is present
   results in an expansion of the cross sectional false lumen area.

AB Current routine MRI examinations rely on the acquisition of qualitative
   images that have a contrast "weighted" for a mixture of (magnetic)
   tissue properties. Recently, a novel approach was introduced, namely MR
   Fingerprinting (MRF) with a completely different approach to data
   acquisition, post-processing and visualization. Instead of using a
   repeated, serial acquisition of data for the characterization of
   individual parameters of interest, MRF uses a pseudo randomized
   acquisition that causes the signals from different tissues to have a
   unique signal evolution or 'fingerprint' that is simultaneously a
   function of the multiple material properties under investigation. The
   processing after acquisition involves a pattern recognition algorithm to
   match the fingerprints to a predefined dictionary of predicted signal
   evolutions. These can then be translated into quantitative maps of the
   magnetic parameters of interest. MR Fingerprinting (MRF) is a technique
   that could theoretically be applied to most traditional qualitative MRI
   methods and replaces them with acquisition of truly quantitative tissue
   measures. MRF is, thereby, expected to be much more accurate and
   reproducible than traditional MRI and should improve multi-center
   studies and significantly reduce reader bias when diagnostic imaging is
   performed. Key Points  MR fingerprinting (MRF) is a new approach to data
   acquisition, post-processing and visualization. MRF provides highly
   accurate quantitative maps of T1, T2, proton density, diffusion. MRF may
   offer multiparametric imaging with high reproducibility, and high
   potential for multicenter/ multivendor studies.

AB Biologics represent a fast-growing class of therapeutics in the
   pharmaceutical sector. Discovery of therapeutic antibodies and
   characterization of peptides can necessitate high expression of the
   target gene requiring the generation of clonal stably transfected cell
   lines. Traditional challenges of stable cell line transfection include
   gene silencing and cell-to-cell variability. Our inability to control
   these can present challenges in lead isolation. Recent progress in
   site-specific targeting of transgene to specific genomic loci has
   transformed the ability to generate stably transfected mammalian cell
   lines. In this article, we describe how the use of the Jump-In platform
   (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) has been applied to drug discovery
   projects. It can easily and rapidly generate homogeneous high-expressing
   cell pools with a high degree of reproducibility. Their use in
   cell-based screening to identify specific binders, identify binding to
   relevant species variants, or detect functionally relevant therapeutic
   antibodies is central in driving drug discovery.

AB In recent years, researchers have turned to transient gene expression
   (TGE) as an alternative to CHO stable cell line generation for
   early-stage antibody development. Despite advances in transfection
   methods and culture optimization, the majority of CHO-based TGE systems
   produce insufficient antibody titers for extensive use within
   biotherapeutic development pipelines. Flow electroporation using the
   MaxCyte STX Scalable Transfection System is a highly efficient, scalable
   means of CHO-based TGE for gram-level production of antibodies without
   the need for specialized expression vectors or genetically engineered
   CHO cell lines. CHO cell flow electroporation is easily scaled from
   milligram to multigram quantities without protocol reoptimization while
   maintaining transfection performance and antibody productivity. In this
   article, data are presented that demonstrate the reproducibility,
   scalability, and antibody production capabilities of CHO-based TGE using
   the MaxCyte STX. Data show optimization of posttransfection parameters
   such as cell density, media composition, and feed strategy that result
   in secreted antibody titers >1 g/L and production of multiple grams of
   antibody within 2 weeks of a single CHO-S cell transfection. In
   addition, data are presented to demonstrate the application of scalable
   electroporation for the rapid generation of high-yield stable CHO cell
   lines to bridge the gap between early- and late-stage antibody
   development activities.

AB This study aimed to assess intrinsic reliabilities of devices for pulse
   wave measurement (PWM). An artificial pulse generator system was
   constructed to create a periodic pulse wave. The stability of the
   periodic output was tested by the DP103 pressure transducer. The pulse
   generator system was then used to evaluate the TD01C system.
   Test-re-test and inter-device reliability assessments were conducted on
   the TD01C system. First, 11 harmonic components of the pulse wave were
   calculated using Fourier series analysis. For each harmonic component,
   coefficient of variation (CV), intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC)
   and Bland-Altman plot were used to determine the degree of reliability
   of the TD01C system. In addition, device exclusion criteria were
   pre-specified to improve consistency of devices. The artificial pulse
   generator system was stable to evaluate intrinsic reliabilities of
   devices for PWM (ICCs>0.95, p<0.001). TD01C was reliable for repeated
   measurements (ICCs of test-re-test reliability>0.95, p<0.001; CVs all <
   3%). Device exclusion criteria successfully excluded the device with
   defect; therefore, the criteria reduced inter-device CVs of harmonics
   and improved consistency of the selected devices for all harmonic
   components. This study confirmed the feasibility of intrinsic
   reliability assessment of devices for PWM using an artificial pulse
   generator system. Moreover, potential novel findings on the assessment
   combined with device exclusion criteria could be a useful method to
   select the measuring devices and to evaluate the qualities of them in
   PWM.

AB PURPOSE: To evaluate the accuracy and source of errors using a
   two-dimensional (2D)/three-dimensional (3D) fusion road map for
   endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) of abdominal aortic aneurysm.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A rigid 2D/3D road map was tested in 16 patients
   undergoing EVAR. After 3D/3D manual registration of preoperative
   multidetector computed tomography (CT) and cone beam CT, abdominal
   aortic aneurysm outlines were overlaid on live fluoroscopy/digital
   subtraction angiography (DSA). Patient motion was evaluated using bone
   landmarks. The misregistration of renal and internal iliac arteries were
   estimated by 3 readers along head-feet and right-left coordinates
   (z-axis and x-axis, respectively) before and after bone and DSA
   corrections centered on the lowest renal artery. Iliac deformation was
   evaluated by comparing centerlines before and during intervention. A
   score of clinical added value was estimated as high (z-axis < 3 mm),
   good (3 mm ≤ z-axis ≤ 5 mm), and low (z-axis > 5 mm). Interobserver
   reproducibility was calculated by the intraclass correlation
   coefficient.
   RESULTS: The lowest renal artery misregistration was estimated at x-axis
   = 10.6 mm ± 11.1 and z-axis = 7.4 mm ± 5.3 before correction and at
   x-axis = 3.5 mm ± 2.5 and z-axis = 4.6 mm ± 3.7 after bone correction (P
   = .08), and at 0 after DSA correction (P < .001). After DSA correction,
   residual misregistration on the contralateral renal artery was estimated
   at x-axis = 2.4 mm ± 2.0 and z-axis = 2.2 mm ± 2.0. Score of clinical
   added value was low (n = 11), good (n= 0), and high (n= 5) before
   correction and low (n = 5), good (n = 4), and high (n = 7) after bone
   correction. Interobserver intraclass correlation coefficient for
   misregistration measurements was estimated at 0.99. Patient motion
   before stent graft delivery was estimated at x-axis = 8 mm ± 5.8 and
   z-axis = 3.0 mm ± 2.7. The internal iliac artery misregistration
   measurements were estimated at x-axis = 6.1 mm ± 3.5 and z-axis = 5.6 mm
   ± 4.0, and iliac centerline deformation was estimated at 38.3 mm ± 15.6.
   CONCLUSIONS: Rigid registration is feasible and fairly accurate. Only a
   partial reduction of vascular misregistration was observed after bone
   correction; minimal DSA acquisition is still required.

AB PURPOSE: A modified quadrant method was developed for description of
   femoral tunnel aperture positions on the sagittal plane after
   double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, which can
   be measured by using two-view radiographs. The purpose of the study is
   to provide a new measurement method and to evaluate the reproducibility
   and accuracy of the method.
   METHODS: Forty-one patients who had undergone a double-bundle ACL
   reconstruction were investigated. Two-view plain radiographs, a
   45-degree-flexion posterior-anterior standing (Rosenberg) and a lateral
   view, were taken at 1year postoperatively, and the femoral tunnel
   positions were measured. Intra- and inter-observer reproducibility was
   calculated by means of intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Also,
   the accuracy of the method was evaluated by comparing the measurement
   from three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT).
   RESULTS: Intra-observer reproducibility was excellent (ICC>0.9).
   Inter-observer reproducibility of antero-medial (AM) tunnel position was
   almost perfect (ICC>0.8) and that of postero-lateral (PL) tunnel was
   substantial (ICC>0.7). The accuracy of the method was assessed by
   comparing the measurement from 3D-CT and was found to be almost perfect
   (ICC>0.8). With the modified quadrant method, the average height of AM
   and PL tunnels were 17.8 and 44.4%, respectively, and the depth of AM
   and PL tunnels were 25.5 and 36.7%, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: A modified quadrant method was found to have acceptable
   reproducibility and accuracy. The method is useful for describing the
   femoral tunnel aperture positions in ACL reconstruction because of its
   easiness and simplicity. By using this method, it is possible to analyse
   the femoral tunnel position even in the cases without CT analysis.

   French the Anterior Cruciate Ligament-Return to Sport after Injury
   (ACL-RSI), a 12-item English language scale assessing the psychological
   impact of returning to sports after ACL reconstruction.
   METHODS: The ACL-RSI scale was forward and back translated,
   cross-culturally adapted and validated using international guidelines.
   The study population included all patients who were active in sports and
   underwent primary arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. The control group
   included subjects with no history of knee trauma. At the 6-month
   follow-up, the study population completed the ACL-RSI scale twice within
   3-4days, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and
   subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores.
   Statistical tests assessed the construct validity, discriminant
   validity, internal consistency, reliability and feasibility of the
   ACL-RSI scale.
   RESULTS: Ninety-one patients with ACL tears and 98 control subjects were
   included: mean age 31.7±8.1 and 21.8±2, respectively. The ACL-RSI scores
   were correlated with all KOOS sub-categories (r=0.22-0.64, p<0.05) as
   well as the subjective IKDC score (r=0.42, p<0.00001). The mean scores
   of the study and control groups were significantly different (62.8±19.4
   vs. 89.6±11.5, p<0.00001), and scores were significantly better in
   patients who returned to the same sport (72.1±21.4 vs. 60.3±18.1,
   p=0.008). Internal consistency was high (alpha=0.96). Test-retest
   reproducibility was excellent: rho=0.90 (0.86-0.94), p<0.00001.
   Administration time was 1.32±0.7mn, and all items were answered.
   CONCLUSION: This study showed that the cross-cultural adaptation of the
   English version of the ACL-RSI was successful and validated in a
   French-speaking population. The discriminant capacity of the scale
   between patients who underwent reconstruction and healthy subjects was
   confirmed.

AB STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Little peer-reviewed information is available
   regarding the accuracy and reproducibility of digitally fabricated casts
   compared to conventional nondigital methods.
   PURPOSE: The purpose of this invitro study was to compare the accuracy
   and reproducibility of a digital impression and cast fabrication with a
   conventional impression and cast fabrication.
   MATERIAL AND METHODS: Conventional impressions were made via a 1-step
   single viscosity technique with vinyl siloxanether material of a
   typodont master model, and conventional casts were cast from dental
   stone. Digital impressions were obtained with a digital scanner, and
   digital stereolithographic models were printed. The typodont and
   fabricated casts were digitized with a structured light scanner and
   saved in surface tessellation language (STL) format. All STL records
   were superimposed via a best-fit method. The digital impression and cast
   fabrication method was compared with the conventional impression and
   cast fabrication method for discrepancy, accuracy, and reproducibility.
   The Levene test was used to determine equality of variances, and a 1-way
   ANOVA was conducted to assess the overall statistical significance of
   differences among the groups (n=5, alpha=.05).
   RESULTS: No significant statistical difference was found between the
   digital cast and conventional casts in the internal area or finish line
   area (P>.05). In addition, there was no statistically significant
   difference between these 2 techniques for a fixed dental prosthesis or
   single crown (P>.05). However, statistically significant differences
   were observed for overall areas of the casts in terms of accuracy
   (P<.01) and reproducibility (P<.001). Digital impression and cast
   fabrication were less accurate and reproducible than conventional
   impression and cast fabrication methods.
   CONCLUSIONS: No statistically significant difference was found between
   the digital cast and conventional cast groups in the internal and finish
   line areas. However, in terms of the reproducibility and accuracy of the
   entire cast area, the conventional cast was significantly better than
   the digital cast.

AB BACKGROUND: Recently, a platform of T-cell replete haploidentical
   hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT) using
   post-transplant cyclophosphamide (Cy) has shown high reproducibility and
   acceptable safety profile.
   METHOD: This prospective cohort analysis allowed us to collect data on
   infections among 70 consecutive recipients of haplo-HSCT affected by
   various hematologic malignancies.
   RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 23months, cumulative incidence of
   viral infections was 70% (95% confidence interval [CI] 59-81) at 100days
   and 77% (95% CI 67-87) at 1year; 35 of 65 patients at risk had CMV
   reactivation (54%) and the rate of polyomavirus-virus-associated
   cystitis was 19% (13/70). Cumulative incidence of bacterial and fungal
   infections at 1year were 63% (95% CI 51-75) and 12% (95% CI 4-19),
   respectively. Of note, only 1 invasive fungal infection occurred beyond
   1year after transplant (day +739).
   CONCLUSION: In conclusion, despite a high rate of viral infections in
   the early period, present data suggest a satisfactory infectious profile
   after T-cell replete haplo-HSCT using post-transplant Cy. These results
   may help clinicians to improve both prophylactic and therapeutic
   antimicrobial strategies in this emerging haploidentical setting.

AB Widespread commercial use of environmentally friendly lead-free
   K0.5Na0.5NbO3 ceramics is limited due to their poor piezoelectric
   properties in the sintered form. The main drawback is probably the poor
   electrical reproducibility associated with the low sinterability.
   Isothermal sintering studies of SnO2, ZnO-SnO2 or Yb2O3 doped
   K0.5Na0.5NbO3 ceramics in the presence of a liquid phase provider, like
   K4CuNb8O23, were carried out for the first time and the findings were
   reported systematically. The optimum sintering temperatures of the neat
   and SnO2, ZnO-SnO2 and Yb2O3 doped K0.5Na0.5NbO3-0.5 mol% K4CuNb8O23
   ceramics were found to be 1120, 1110, 1080 and 1090 degrees C,
   respectively, with relative densities more than 98%. A lower shift in
   the sintering temperature of ZnO-SnO2 co-doped samples by 40 degrees C
   as compared to that of neat one was observed in these studies using
   dilatometric measurements. Considering the upper bound narrow sintering
   temperature window of K0.5Na0.5NbO3, this shift was a major achievement.
   Overall, ICNN ceramics with various dopants could be sintered to high
   densities consistently without degrading electrical properties. (C) 2014

AB ObjectivesBoth HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy (ART) may
   increase cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Assessments of vascular
   function and structure can be used to study the pathogenesis and
   progression of CVD, including the effects of ART and other
   interventions. The objective of this report is to understand methods to
   assess vascular (dys)function and report our experience in the Arterial
   Elasticity Substudy in the Strategic Timing of AntiRetroviral Treatment
   (START) trial.
   MethodsWe review literature and analyze baseline data from the Arterial
   Elasticity Substudy, which estimated vascular (dys)function through
   analysis of the diastolic blood pressure (BP) waveform. Linear
   regression was used to study cross-sectional associations between
   baseline clinical factors and small or large arterial elasticity.
   ResultsArterial elasticity measurement was chosen for its improved
   measurement reproducibility over other methodologies and the potential
   of small arterial elasticity to predict clinical risk. Analysis of
   baseline data demonstrates that small artery elasticity is impaired
   (lower) with older age and differs by race and between geographical
   regions. No HIV-specific factors studied remained significantly
   associated with arterial elasticity in multivariate models.
   ConclusionsLongitudinal analyses in this substudy will provide essential
   randomized data with which to study the effects of early ART initiation
   on the progression of vascular disease among a diverse global
   population. When combined with future biomarker analyses and clinical
   outcomes in START, these findings will expand our understanding of the
   pathogenesis of HIV-related CVD.

AB Objective Commercial sunscreens consist of various compounds ranging
   from inorganic mineral pigments to organic chemical absorbents to
   achieve the required degree of protection against sunlight. However, the
   UV radiation screening ingredients have side effects. In this study,
   therefore, to ensure compliance with the maximum permissible chemical
   concentrations in sunscreen cosmetic products, a simultaneous and
   improved determination method for sunscreen chemicals was assessed.
   MethodsWaters 2690 separations module HPLC system equipped with a Waters
   486 tunable absorbance detector (UV-visible detector) has been employed
   and optimized to detect 14 compounds. For the separation, a Waters C18
   column (5m, 4.6mm i.d. 150mm) and 1% of 0.1M phosphoric acid in ethanol
   (solvent A) and in distilled water (solvent B) as mobile phases were
   used.
   ResultsThe correlation coefficients of 14 standard mixture solutions
   exceeded 0.9993 in the range 2.5-200gmL(-1). The intra- and interday
   recovery and precision (relative standard deviation) of the method were
   90.91-109.98% and within 10%, respectively, indicating that the
   developed method could provide reliable, precise and reproducible data.
   The detection limit was determined to be 0.01-1.99gmL(-1), and the
   quantization limit was determined to be 0.02-6.02gmL(-1), which were
   relatively lower than previous studies.
   ConclusionThis method was highly optimized in terms of selectivity,
   reproducibility and efficiency for the detection of 14 compounds. The
   validation data indicated that the improved method was quite suitable
   for their quantitative analysis of commercial product samples.
   Therefore, this method was applied to the determination of 14 compounds
   in commercial sunscreen cosmetic products. We verified that the amounts
   of sunscreen ingredients in the five currently sold sunscreens were
   >0.5% and within the designated limit, which means those could produce
   the safe and desired sunscreen effects on the skin. The present method
   could be applied to effectively monitor the process management and
   quality control of the cosmetics that are sold in the market.

AB Background. There is an increasing interest in oscillometric arterial
   stiffness measurement for cardiovascular risk stratification. We
   assessed reproducibility of the cuff-based arterial stiffness measures
   cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI), brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity
   (baPWV) and peripheral augmentation index (pAI) in a subsample of the
   second follow-up of the Swiss Cohort Study on Air Pollution and Lung and
   Heart Diseases in Adults (SAPALDIA 3). Methods. CAVI, baPWV and pAI were
   measured twice within 90 days in a representative subsample (n = 105) of
   SAPALDIA 3 with a mean age of 63 years (52.4% female). Results. The mean
   coefficient of variation for CAVI was 4.4%, baPWV 3.9%, and pAI 7.4%.
   The intraclass correlation coefficient ranged from 0.6 for pAI to 0.8
   for CAVI, and 0.9 for baPWV. The mixed linear model revealed that
   68.7%/80.1%/55.0% of the CAVI/baPWV/pAI variance was accounted for by
   the subject, 5.2%/8.1%/ < 0.01% by the fieldworker, 6.7%/7.8%/28.5% by
   variation between measurement days, and 19.4%/4%/16.5% by measurement
   error. Bland-Altman plots showed no particular dispersion patterns
   except for pAI. Conclusions. Oscillometric arterial stiffness
   measurement by CAVI and baPWV has proved to be highly reproducible in
   Caucasians. Results of the pAI showed lower reproducibility. CAVI and
   baPWV can be implemented as easy-to-apply arterial stiffness measures in
   population wide cardiovascular risk assessment in Caucasians.

AB Percutaneous catheter ablation is being increasingly performed in
   patients with recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) unresponsive to
   medical treatment. Optimal management of patients requires careful
   consideration of the severity of the underlying cardiac disease, the
   anesthetic drug interactions, and the procedural technique during VT
   mapping and ablation. The goal is to choose an anesthetic technique that
   has the least effect on arrhythmogenicity, allowing reproducibility of
   the VT in the electrophysiology laboratory. Anesthetics can alter action
   potential and ventricular depolarization directly through their effects
   on ion channels and gap junctions, as well as indirectly via their
   effects on the autonomic nervous system. Furthermore, maintaining
   hemodynamic stability and monitoring for adequate end-organ perfusion
   are additional challenges. In this review, we provide a comprehensive
   update on the currently performed VT ablation procedures and their
   anesthetic considerations.

AB Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) technology has been
   investigated for long time because of its tremendous potential in
   chemical and biomolecular detection. One of the challenging works in
   this field is to fabricate fantastic substrates with high sensitivity,
   stability, and reproducibility. This work reports a novel SERS substrate
   based on MnO 2/Au hybrid nanowall film prepared by simple and cheap
   hydrothermal method combined with subsequent vacuum thermal evaporation
   process. Enhanced SERS enhancement factor (EF) with increased thickness
   of gold layer was observed and a significant increase of EF up to 8
   orders of magnitude has been achieved. Finite-difference time-domain
   (FDTD) simulations have been carried out to elucidate the origin of the
   enhancement and the distribution of the ldquohot spotsrdquo.
   Experimental evidences indicate that the as-prepared substrate possesses
   excellent SERS sensitivity, good stability and high reproducibility. Our
   results provide a novel MnO 2/Au hybrid nanowall film as a convenient
   and robust SERS-active substrate for detecting biomolecules. [All rights

   controllable-density nanojunctions with ink-jet printing technique. In
   this system, polyvinylpyrrolidone-capped silver nanoparticles (AgNPs)
   were ink-jet printed on substrates and subsequently dipped into sodium
   chloride solution. The capped molecules on the AgNPs surfaces were
   detached with the competitive absorption of chloride, and spontaneously
   triggered to form the controllable-density nanojunctions among the AgNPs
   aggregates. These formed AgNPs nanojunctions demonstrated excellent
   controllability, reproducibility, and a detection limit of 1 times 10
   -11 M level for Rhodamine 6G probe molecules. This strategy could be
   expected to construct multifarious SERS sensors for highly sensitive

   by combining the previous categories of "consistent with GVHD" and
   "definite GVHD" into the single category of "likely GVHD." Issues remain

AB Strain preservation of experimental animals is crucial for experimental
   reproducibility. Maintaining complete animal strains, however, is costly
   and there is a risk for genetic mutations as well as complete loss due
   to disasters or illness. Therefore, the development of effective
   vitrification techniques for cryopreservation of multiple experimental
   animal strains is important. We examined whether a vitrification method
   using cryoprotectant solutions, P10 and PEPeS, is suitable for
   preservation of multiple inbred and outbred mouse strains. First, we
   investigated whether our vitrification method using cryoprotectant
   solutions was suitable for two-cell stage mouse embryos. In vitro
   development of embryos exposed to the cryoprotectant solutions was
   similar to that of fresh controls. Further, the survival rate of the
   vitrified embryos was extremely high (98.1%). Next, we collected and
   vitrified two-cell stage embryos of 14 mouse strains. The average number
   of embryos obtained from one female was 7.3-33.3. The survival rate of
   vitrified embryos ranged from 92.8% to 99.1%, with no significant
   differences among mouse strains. In vivo development did not differ
   significantly between fresh controls and vitrified embryos of each
   strain. For strain preservation using cryopreserved embryos, two
   offspring for inbred lines and one offspring for outbred lines must be
   produced from two-cell stage embryos collected from one female. The
   expected number of surviving fetuses obtained from embryos collected
   from one female of either the inbred or outbred strains ranged from 2.9
   to 19.5. The findings of the present study indicated that this
   vitrification method is suitable for strain preservation of multiple
   mouse strains.

AB The perception that natural substances are deemed safe has made
   traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) popular in the treatment and
   prevention of disease globally. However, such an assumption is often
   misleading owing to a lack of scientific validation. To assess the
   safety of TCM, in silico screening provides major advantages over the
   classical laboratory approaches in terms of resource- and time-saving
   and full reproducibility. To screen the hepatotoxicity of the active
   compounds of TCMs, a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR)
   model was firstly established by utilizing drugs from the Liver Toxicity
   Knowledge Base. These drugs were annotated with drug-induced liver
   injury information obtained from clinical trials and post-marketing
   surveillance. The performance of the model after nested 10-fold
   cross-validation was 79.1%, 91.2%, 53.8% for accuracy, sensitivity, and
   specificity, respectively. The external validation of 91 well-known
   ingredients of common herbal medicines yielded a high accuracy (87%).
   After screening the TCM Database@Taiwan, the world's largest TCM
   database, a total of 6853 (74.8%) ingredients were predicted to have
   hepatotoxic potential. The one-hundred chemical ingredients predicted to
   have the highest hepatotoxic potential by our model were further
   verified by published literatures. Our study indicated that this model
   can serve as a complementary tool to evaluate the safety of TCM.

AB PURPOSE: To describe a spectral domain optical coherence (OCT)-assisted
   method of measuring retinal vessel diameters.
   METHODS: All Patients with an OCT circle scan centered at the optic
   nerve head using a Spectralis OCT (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg,
   Germany) were retrospectively reviewed. Individual retinal vessels were
   identified on infrared reflectance (IR) images and given unique labels
   both on IR and spectral domain OCT (SD-OCT). Vessel width and vessel
   types obtained by IR were documented as ground truth. From OCT,
   measurements of each vessel, including horizontal vessel contour
   diameter, vertical vessel contour diameter, horizontal hyperreflective
   core diameter, and reflectance shadowing width, were assessed.
   RESULTS: A total of 220 vessels from 13 eyes of 12 patients were
   labeled, among which, 194 vessels (88 arteries and 65 veins confirmed
   from IR) larger than 40 microns were included in the study. The mean
   vessel width obtained from IR was 107.9±36.1 microns. A mean vertical
   vessel contour diameter of 119.6±29.9 microns and a mean horizontal
   vessel contour diameter of 124.1±31.1 microns were measured by SD-OCT.
   Vertical vessel contour diameter did not differ from vessel width in all
   subgroup analysis. Horizontal vessel contour diameter was not
   significantly different from vessel width for arteries and had strong or
   very strong correlation with vessel width for veins.
   CONCLUSION: In our study, vertical vessel contour diameter measured by
   current commercially available SD-OCT was consistent with vessel width
   obtained by IR with good reproducibility. This SD-OCT based method could
   potentially be used as a standard measurement procedure to evaluate
   retinal vessel diameters and their changes in ocular and systemic
   disorders.

AB The aim of this study was to develop biocompatible, biodegradable dental
   implant coatings capable of withstanding the mechanical stresses
   imparted during implant placement. Two techniques were developed to
   deposit uniform silk fibroin protein coatings onto dental implants. Two
   novel coating techniques were implemented to coat titanium shims, studs,
   and implants. One technique involved electrodeposition of the silk
   directly onto the titanium substrates. The second technique consisted of
   melting electrogels and dispensing the melted gels onto the titanium to
   form the coatings. Both techniques were tested for coating
   reproducibility using a stylus profilometer and a dial thickness gauge.
   The mechanical strength of adhered titanium studs was assessed using a
   universal mechanical testing machine. Uniform, controllable coatings
   were obtained from both the electrodeposition and melted electrogel
   coating techniques, tunable from 35 to 1654m thick under the conditions
   studied, and able to withstand delamination during implantation into
   implant socket mimics. Mechanical testing revealed that the adhesive
   strength of electrogel coatings, 0.369±0.09MPa, rivaled other
   biologically derived coating systems such as collagen, hydroxyapatite,
   and chitosan (0.07-4.83MPa). These novel silk-based techniques offer a
   unique approach to the deposition of safe, simple, mechanically robust,
   biocompatible, and degradable implant coatings.

AB A large number of studies have suggested that polysaccharides, such as
   fucoidan and laminarin, in various seaweeds have significant biological
   properties. A different distribution of molecular weights is a prominent
   sign of many polysaccharides. Therefore, a simple, fast and reliable
   high-performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) method was
   proposed to separate fucoidan and laminarin from Laminaria japonica.
   After evaluating the different separation conditions for HPSEC, such as
   the type of mobile phase and flow rate, an acid extraction method was
   established and optimized by a systematic investigation of the
   influencing factors. Under the optimal conditions, 169.2 and 383.8 mg
   g(-1) of fucoidan and laminarin, respectively, were extracted. This
   method is suitable for the extraction and separation of polysaccharides
   with good reproducibility of the retention time, acceptable linearity,
   small relative standard deviation and low detection limits.

AB A new capillary electrophoresis (CE) method was developed by using
   graphene oxide (GO) as a stationary phase for the separation of brucine
   and strychnine. The separation performance, reproducibility and
   stability of GO-coated capillary were investigated for the analysis of
   brucine and strychnine. After optimization of the separation conditions,
   a phosphate solution (40 mM, pH 7.0) containing 25% (v/v) acetonitrile
   was selected as the running buffer. Compared with uncoated capillary,
   higher separation efficiency was achieved by GO-coated capillary as a
   result of the increasing interactions between the analytes and the
   stationary phase of capillary. The linear ranges of these two alkaloids
   were 4.0-100.0 mug mL(-1) with a satisfied correlation coefficients (R >
   0.9994), and this novel method provided an efficient separation of
   brucine and strychnine as well as a good reproducibility and stability.
   Finally, the developed method was successfully applied for the
   determination of these two alkaloids in a pharmaceutical formulation of
   traditional Chinese medicines.

AB OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare nonlinear modeling methods for handling
   continuous predictors for reproducibility and transportability of
   prediction models.
   STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We analyzed four cohorts of previously
   unscreened men who underwent prostate biopsy for diagnosing prostate
   cancer. Continuous predictors of prostate cancer included
   prostate-specific antigen and prostate volume. The logistic regression
   models included linear terms, logarithmic terms, fractional polynomials
   of degree one or two (FP1 and FP2), or restricted cubic splines (RCS)
   with three or five knots (RCS3 and RCS5). The resulting models were
   internally validated by bootstrap resampling and externally validated in
   the cohorts not used at model development. Performance was assessed with
   the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the
   calibration component of the Brier score (CAL).
   RESULTS: At internal validation models with FP2 or RCS5 showed slightly
   better performance than the other models (typically 0.004 difference in
   AUC and 0.001 in CAL). At external validation models containing
   logarithms, FP1, or RCS3 showed better performance (differences 0.01 and
   0.002).
   CONCLUSION: Flexible nonlinear modeling methods led to better model
   performance at internal validation. However, when application of the
   model is intended across a wide range of settings, less flexible
   functions may be more appropriate to maximize external validity.

AB AIMS: Disagreement exists on effective and sensitive outcome measures in
   neuropathy associated with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Nerve
   conduction studies and skin biopsies are costly, invasive and may have
   their problems with reproducibility and clinical applicability. A
   clinical measure of neuropathy that has sufficient sensitivity and
   correlates to invasive measures would enable significant future
   research.
   METHODS: Data was collected prospectively on patients with IGT and
   symptomatic early neuropathy (neuropathy symptoms <2years) and normal
   controls. The seven scales that were examined were the Neuropathy
   Impairment Score of the Lower Limb (NIS-LL), Michigan Diabetic
   Neuropathy Score (MNDS), modified Toronto Clinical Neuropathy Scale
   (mTCNS), Total Neuropathy Score (Clinical) (TNSc), The Utah Early
   Neuropathy Scale (UENS), the Early Neuropathy Score (ENS), and the
   Neuropathy Disability Score (NDS).
   RESULTS: All seven clinical scales were determined to be excellent in
   discriminating between patients with neuropathy from controls without
   neuropathy. The strongest discrimination was seen with the mTCNS. The
   best sensitivity and specificity for the range of scores obtained, as
   determined by using receiver operating characteristic curves, was seen
   for the mTCNS followed by the TNSc. Most scales show a stronger
   correlation with measures of large rather than small fiber neuropathy.
   CONCLUSIONS: All seven scales identify patients with neuropathy. For the
   purpose of screening potential patients for a clinical study, the mTCNS
   followed by the TNSc would be most helpful to select patients with
   neuropathy.

AB OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to estimate reference ranges
   for the pulsatility index (PI) of the fetal aortic isthmus in
   uncomplicated singleton and twin pregnancies during the second half of
   pregnancy.
   METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional observational study involving
   543 healthy fetuses: 361 singleton pregnancies and 182 twin pregnancies
   between 19 and 36 weeks' gestation. The aortic isthmus PI was measured
   in 2 sonographic planes: the longitudinal aortic arch view and the
   3-vessel and trachea view. We evaluated the reproducibility of aortic
   isthmus PI measurements between these planes by calculating intraclass
   correlation coefficients and limits of agreement. Scans were performed
   by 2 physicians, and intraobserver agreement was also measured.
   Regression analysis was used to estimate gestational age reference
   values for the aortic isthmus PI.
   RESULTS: The aortic isthmus PI was significantly correlated with
   gestational age in singletons and twins during the second half of
   pregnancy (P < .01). We did not find significant differences between
   reference ranges in singletons and twins or between the sonographic
   views.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study offers reference ranges for the aortic isthmus
   PI during the second half of gestation in singleton and twin
   pregnancies. Mean aortic isthmus PI values were similar in both types of
   gestations as well as both sonographic views. The aortic isthmus PI may
   be reliably obtained from either sonographic view.

AB Cryptococcus neoformans is the etiologic agent of cryptococcal
   meningitis that causes more than half a million deaths worldwide each
   year. This capsulated basidiomycetous yeast also serves as a model for
   micropathogenic studies. The ability to make stable mutants, either via
   ectopic integration or homologous recombination, has been accomplished
   using biolistic transformation. This technical advance has greatly
   facilitated the research on the basic biology and pathogenic mechanisms
   of this pathogen in the past two decades. However, biolistic
   transformation is costly, and its reproducibility varies widely. Here we
   found that stable ectopic integration or targeted gene deletion via
   homologous replacement could be accomplished through electroporative
   transformation. The stability of the transformants obtained through
   electroporation and the frequency of homologous replacement is highly
   dependent on the selective marker. A frequency of homologous
   recombination among the stable transformants obtained by electroporation
   is comparable to those obtained by biolistic transformation (10%) when
   dominant drug selection markers are used, which is much higher than what
   has been previously reported for electroporation when auxotrophic
   markers were used (0.001% to 0.1%). Furthermore, disruption of the KU80
   gene or generation of gene deletion constructs using the split marker
   strategy, two approaches known to increase homologous replacement among
   transformants obtained through biolistic transformation, also increase
   the frequency of homologous replacement among transformants obtained
   through electroporation. Therefore, electroporation provides a low cost
   alternative for mutagenesis in Cryptococcus.

AB A previous study used a PortaCount Plus to measure the ratio of particle
   concentrations outside (C out) to inside (C in) of filtering facepiece
   respirators (FFRs) worn by test subjects and calculated the total inward
   leakage (TIL) (C in/C out) to evaluate the reproducibility of the TIL
   test method between two different National Institute for Occupational
   Safety and Health laboratories (Laboratories 1 and 2) at the Pittsburgh
   Campus. The purpose of this study is to utilize the originally obtained
   PortaCount C out/C in ratio as a measure of protection factor (PF) and
   evaluate the influence of particle distribution and filter efficiency.
   PFs were obtained for five N95 model FFRs worn by 35 subjects for three
   donnings (5 models * 35 subjects * 3 donnings) for a total of 525 tests
   in each laboratory. The geometric mean of PFs, geometric standard
   deviation (GSD), and the 5th percentile values for the five N95 FFR
   models were calculated for the two laboratories. Filter efficiency was
   obtained by measuring the penetration for four models (A, B, C, and D)
   against Laboratory 2 aerosol using two condensation particle counters.
   Particle size distribution, measured using a Scanning Mobility Particle
   Sizer, showed a mean count median diameter (CMD) of 82nm in Laboratory 1
   and 131nm in Laboratory 2. The smaller CMD showed relatively higher
   concentration of nanoparticles in Laboratory 1 than in Laboratory 2.
   Results showed that the PFs and 5th percentile values for two models (B
   and E) were larger than other three models (A, C, and D) in both
   laboratories. The PFs and 5th percentile values of models B and E in
   Laboratory 1 with a count median diameter (CMD) of 82nm were smaller
   than in Laboratory 2 with a CMD of 131nm, indicating an association
   between particle size distribution and PF. The three lower efficiency
   models (A, C, and D) showed lower PF values than the higher efficiency
   model B showing the influence of filter efficiency on PF value. Overall,
   the data show that particle size distribution and filter efficiency
   influence the PFs and 5th percentile values. The PFs and 5th percentile
   values decreased with increasing nanoparticle concentration (from CMD of
   131 to 82nm) indicating lower PFs for aerosol distribution within
   nanoparticle size range (<100nm). Further studies on the relationship
   between particle size distribution and PF are needed to better
   understand the respiratory protection against nanoparticles.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate reproducibility of fluorine-18 fludeoxyglucose
   ((18)F-FDG) uptake on (18)F-FDG positron emission tomography (PET)/CT
   and (18)F-FDG PET/MR scans in patients with head and neck squamous cell
   carcinoma (HNSCC).
   METHODS: 30 patients with HNSCC were included in this prospective study.
   The patients were scanned twice before radiotherapy treatment with both
   PET/CT and PET/MR. Patients were scanned on the same scanners, 3 days
   apart and according to the same protocol. Metabolic tumour activity was
   measured by the maximum and peak standardized uptake value (SUVmax and
   SUVpeak, respectively), and total lesion glycolysis from the metabolic
   tumour volume defined from ≥50% SUVmax. Bland-Altman analysis with
   limits of agreement, coefficient of variation (CV) from the two
   modalities were performed in order to test the reproducibility.
   Furthermore, CVs from SUVmax and SUVpeak were compared. The area under
   the curve from cumulative SUV-volume histograms were measured and tested
   for reproducibility of the distribution of (18)F-FDG uptake.
   RESULTS: 24 patients had two pre-treatment PET/CT scans and 21 patients
   had two pre-treatment PET/MR scans available for further analyses. Mean
   difference for SUVmax, peak and mean was approximately 4% for PET/CT and
   3% for PET/MR, with 95% limits of agreement less than ±20%. CV was small
   (5-7%) for both modalities. There was no significant difference in CVs
   between PET/CT and PET/MR (p=0.31). SUVmax was not more reproducible
   than SUVpeak (p=0.09).
   CONCLUSION: (18)F-FDG uptake in PET/CT and PET/MR is highly reproducible
   and we found no difference in reproducibility between PET/CT and PET/MR.
   ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: This is the first report to test reproducibility
   of PET/CT and PET/MR.

AB Synthesis of biocompatible metal nanoparticles has been an area of
   significant interest because of their wide range of applications. In the
   present study, we have successfully synthesized water soluble silver
   nanoparticles assisted by small amino acid glycine. The method is
   primarily based on reduction of AgNO3 with NaBH4 in aqueous solution
   under atmospheric air in the presence of glycine. UV-vis spectroscopy,
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier
   transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetry (TG) and
   differential thermal analysis (DTA) techniques used for characterization
   of resulting silver nanoparticles demonstrated that, glycine is an
   effective capping agent to stabilize silver nanoparticles. Surface
   selective interaction of glycine on (111) face of silver nanoparticles
   has been investigated. The optical property and crystalline behavior of
   silver nanoparticles were found to be sensitive to concentration of
   glycine. X-ray diffraction studies ascertained the phase specific
   interaction of glycine on silver nanoparticles. Silver nanoparticles
   synthesized were of diameter 60 nm. We thus demonstrated an efficient
   synthetic method for synthesis of water soluble silver nanoparticles
   capped by amino acid under mild reaction conditions with excellent
   reproducibility. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Due to their high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and robustness to
   artifacts, steady state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) are a popular
   technique for studying neural processing in the human visual system.
   SSVEPs are conventionally analyzed at individual electrodes or linear
   combinations of electrodes which maximize some variant of the SNR. Here
   we exploit the fundamental assumption of evoked responses -
   reproducibility across trials - to develop a technique that extracts a
   small number of high SNR, maximally reliable SSVEP components. This
   novel spatial filtering method operates on an array of Fourier
   coefficients and projects the data into a low-dimensional space in which
   the trial-to-trial spectral covariance is maximized. When applied to two
   sample data sets, the resulting technique recovers physiologically
   plausible components (i.e., the recovered topographies match the lead
   fields of the underlying sources) while drastically reducing the
   dimensionality of the data (i.e., more than 90% of the trial-to-trial
   reliability is captured in the first four components). Moreover, the
   proposed technique achieves a higher SNR than that of the single-best
   electrode or the Principal Components. We provide a freely-available
   MATLAB implementation of the proposed technique, herein termed "Reliable
   Components Analysis". (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Human neuroimaging of tissue microstructure, such as axonal density and
   integrity, is key in clinical and neuroscience research. Most studies
   rely on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and the measures derived from it,
   most prominently fractional anisotropy (FA). However, FA also depends on
   fiber orientation distribution, a more macroscopic tissue property.
   Recently introduced measures of so-called microscopic diffusion
   anisotropy, diffusion anisotropy on a cellular or microscopic level,
   overcome this limitation because they are independent of the orientation
   distributions of axons and fibers. In this study, we evaluate the
   feasibility of two measures of microscopic diffusion anisotropy I-MA and
   MA indices, for human neuroscience and clinical research. Both indices
   reflect the eccentricity of the cells but while I-MA also depends on the
   cell size, MA is independent of the cell size and, like FA, scaled
   between 0 and 1. In whole-brain measurements of a group of 19 healthy
   volunteers, we measured average values and variability, evaluated their
   reproducibility, both within and between sessions, and compared MA to FA
   values in selected regions-of-interest (ROIs). The within-and
   between-session comparison did not show substantial differences but the
   reproducibility was much better for the MA than I-MA (coefficient of
   variation between sessions 10.5% vs. 28.9%). The reproducibility was
   less for MA than FA overall, but comparable in the defined ROIs and the
   average group sizes required for between-group comparisons was similar
   (about 60 participants for a relative difference of 5%). Group-averaged
   values of MA index were generally larger and showed less variation
   across white-matter brain ROIs than FA (mean +/- standard deviation of
   seven ROIs 0.83 +/- 0.10 vs. 0.58 +/- 0.13). Even in some gray-matter
   ROIs, MA values comparable to those of white matter ROIs were observed.
   Furthermore, the within-group variation of the values in white matter
   ROIs was lower for the MA compared to the FA (mean standard deviation
   over volunteers 0.038 vs. 0.049) which could be due to significant
   variability in the distribution of fiber orientation contributing to FA.
   These results indicate that MA (i) should be preferred to I-MA, (ii) has
   a reproducibility and group-size requirements comparable to those of FA;
   (iii) is less sensitive to the fiber orientation distribution than FA;
   and (iv) could be more sensitive to differences or changes of the tissue
   microstructure than FA. R1.1 (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Metrics derived from the diffusion tensor, such as fractional anisotropy
   (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) have been used in many studies of
   postnatal brain development. A common finding of previous studies is
   that these tensor-derived measures vary widely even in healthy
   populations. This variability can be due to inherent interindividual
   biological differences as well as experimental noise. Moreover, when
   comparing different studies, additional variability can be introduced by
   different acquisition protocols. In this study we examined scans of 61
   individuals (aged 4-22 years) from the NIH MRI study of normal brain
   development. Two scans were collected with different protocols (low and
   high resolution). Our goal was to separate the contributions of
   biological variability and experimental noise to the overall measured
   variance, as well as to assess potential systematic effects related to
   the use of different protocols. We analyzed FA and MD in seventeen
   regions of interest. We found that biological variability for both FA
   and MD varies widely across brain regions; biological variability is
   highest for FA in the lateral part of the splenium and body of the
   corpus callosum along with the cingulum and the superior longitudinal
   fasciculus, and for MD in the optic radiations and the lateral part of
   the splenium. These regions with high inter-individual biological
   variability are the most likely candidates for assessing genetic and
   environmental effects in the developing brain. With respect to
   protocol-related effects, the lower resolution acquisition resulted in
   higherMD and lower FA values for the majority of regions compared with
   the higher resolution protocol. However, the majority of the regions did
   not show any age-protocol interaction, indicating similar trajectories
   were obtained irrespective of the protocol used. Published by Elsevier

AB Our aim was to develop a fast and efficient on-line method using
   micro-reactors for the digestion and deglycosylation of recombinant
   human erythropoietin extracted from equine plasma. The trypsin digestion
   micro reactors were fabricated using fused silica capillaries with
   either a dextran-modified coating or a porous monolith that was able to
   immobilise the enzyme. These were both found to be reasonably robust and
   durable, with the trypsin immobilised on dextran-modified fused silica
   capillaries offering better reproducibility than the micro-reactor based
   upon covalent attachment of this enzyme to the polymer. It is also
   evident that the enzyme attached micro reactors produced some tryptic
   peptides in a greater yield than in-solution digestion. A
   peptide-N-glycosidase F reactor was also fabricated and, when coupled
   with the trypsin reactor, the deaminated peptides T5 DAM and T9 DAM from
   recombinant human erythropoietin could also be detected by LC-ESI-MS/MS
   analysis. These results were better than those achieved using off-line
   digestion plus deglycosylation reactions and the analysis required far
   less time and effort to complete. The use of this on-line approach
   improved the sensitivity, efficiency and speed of our confirmation
   methodology that is based upon detecting the unique peptide segments of
   recombinant human erythropoietin that has been affinity extracted from

AB RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To compare the results of two software-based
   methods, Quantra and Volpara, for volumetric breast composition
   assessment.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four hundred forty-five normal, bilateral,
   two-view, digital mammograms were included. Breast volume (BV),
   fibroglandular tissue volume (FTV), and percent density (PD) were
   measured using both methods and compared. Deming regression was
   performed to obtain linear equations for mapping the results of one
   software on the other.
   RESULTS: The median and quartile ranges of both methods agreed well for
   BV but were different for FTV and PD, with Quantra showing much higher
   values of FTV and PD. The correlation of results obtained by both
   methods for BV, FTV, and PD was 0.99, 0.91, and 0.94, respectively.
   Intraclass correlation in the assignment of quartiles of BV, FTV, and PD
   was 0.96, 0.86, and 0.90, respectively. Both methods showed a similar
   association of FTV and PD with patient age and similar left-to-right
   correlation. Mapping of results onto each other using linear equations
   removed the systematic differences.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although Quantra and Volpara use different models for
   analysis of volumetric breast composition and produce different nominal
   results of FTV and PD, both methods are highly correlated and show very
   good to excellent agreement in quartile assignment of all parameters
   measured. Both methods show a similar association with patient age and
   similar reproducibility. Both methods can be mapped onto each other
   using the equations suggested.

AB Data regarding the prognostic significance of the histopathologic
   classifications of thymic epithelial neoplasms are contradictory,
   perhaps reflecting issues in reproducibility. We studied the effect of
   reproducibility of 3 histopathologic classifications on prognosis and
   investigated the interobserver agreement on invasion and its effect on
   staging and prognosis. A total of 456 patients who underwent surgery for
   thymic epithelial neoplasm at Mayo Clinic Rochester (1942 to 2008) were
   staged (modified Masaoka, proposed Moran, proposed IASLC/ITMIG) and
   independently classified by 3 thoracic pathologists (World Health
   Organization, proposed Suster & Moran [S&M], and Bernatz). Interobserver
   agreement was moderate to substantial for all histopathologic
   classifications (kappa values: 0.65, 0.52, 0.74 for World Health
   Organization, Bernatz, and S&M, respectively). All histopathologic
   classifications were significant for overall survival (OS) and
   disease-free survival (DFS) (all reviewers). If adjusted for Masaoka,
   only Bernatz classification for one reviewer and all histopathologic
   classifications for another reviewer were significant for OS.
   Interobserver agreement for invasion was substantial (kappa=0.61) and
   almost perfect for Masaoka, Moran, and IASLC/ITMIG stage (kappa values:
   0.85, 0.81, and 0.92, respectively). The correlation coefficient for
   Masaoka and Moran staging was 0.93. Masaoka and IASLC/ITMIG staging were
   significant for OS and DFS (all reviewers). If adjusted for any
   histopathologic classification, Masaoka was significant for OS and DFS
   (all reviewers). In conclusion, reproducibility of histopathologic
   classifications has some effect on outcome. S&M is the most reproducible
   classification. Reproducibility of invasion has no effect on the
   prognostic value of staging. Masaoka, Moran, and IASLC/ITMIG staging are
   almost perfectly reproducible. The strong correlation between Masaoka
   and Moran staging suggests similar prognostic strength.

AB Tumor budding is a well-established adverse prognostic factor in
   colorectal cancer. However, the significance and diagnostic
   reproducibility of budding in pancreatic carcinoma requires further
   study. We aimed to assess the prognostic significance of tumor budding
   in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, determine its relationship with
   other clinicopathologic features, and assess interobserver variability
   in its diagnosis. Tumor budding was assessed in 192 archival cases of
   pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
   sections; tumor buds were defined as single cells or nonglandular
   clusters composed of <5 cells. The presence of budding was determined
   through assessment of all tumor-containing slides, and associations with
   clinicopathologic features and outcomes were analyzed. Six
   gastrointestinal pathologists participated in an interobserver
   variability study of 120 images of consecutive tumor slides stained with
   H&E and cytokeratin. Budding was present in 168 of 192 cases and was
   associated with decreased overall survival (P=0.001). On multivariable
   analysis, tumor budding was prognostically significantly independent of
   stage, grade, tumor size, nodal status, lymphovascular invasion, and
   perineural invasion. There was substantial agreement among pathologists
   in assessing the presence of tumor budding using both H&E (K=0.63) and
   cytokeratin (K=0.63) stains. The presence of tumor budding is an
   independent adverse prognostic factor in pancreatic ductal carcinoma.
   The assessment of budding with H&E is reliable and could be used to
   better risk stratify patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

AB The interior wall facings that delimit industrial rooms are often
   uneven, i.e. they often have relief, and that causes the sound
   propagating in such premises to be acoustically scattered. Acoustic
   prediction software making it possible to plot maps of the sound field
   in workplaces needs characteristics such as the sound absorption or the
   sound scattering coefficient of such surfaces. In this work, we propose
   to obtain experimental this sound scattering coefficient of vertical
   surfaces in situ thanks to a new measurement. The experimental technique
   that was originally developed under free-field conditions was adapted to
   attenuate the echoes coming from reverberation and the noise coming from
   sources and machines present on the site. For that purpose, a first
   device has been developed containing a multipolar acoustic array and an
   impulsive source used respectively for achieving spatial filtering and
   for separating in time the different echoes. The new device developed
   and presented in this paper has been used on several measurement
   campaigns, and it has thus been possible to study, among other things,
   the reproducibility of the results. Installing a large multipolar array
   made it possible to obtain good accuracy for the results at low
   frequencies. The scattering coefficient of a vertical surface containing
   a rectangular cavity was measured for various angles of incidence in a
   noisy and reverberant environment. Finally, those measurements made it
   possible to map the sound scattering coefficient in the XY directions
   and thus to highlight the highly variable scattering mechanisms of a
   uneven structure depending on the measurement point. (C) 2014 Elsevier

AB When carrying out acoustical measurements in order to construct an urban
   noise map, the ISO 1996 international standard is usually taken as a
   reference. However, this standard does not determine the precise
   location where we should place the measuring equipment. Instead, in some
   cases the standard offers corrections for the measured sound pressure
   level to assure reproducibility and comparability in the results.
   In this paper, we have carried out simultaneous measurements with two
   sound-level meters to study the effect of varying the location of the
   measuring equipment in terms of its height and the distance to the rear
   facade.
   The results indicate the need to apply some corrections due to
   reflexions on the facade with lower values than those recommended by the
   standard. In addition, it has been found necessary to make corrections
   for the distance to the source. Discrepancies between the standard and
   the results could be explained by the existence of screening effects
   associated with the parking lanes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Objectives: To assess inter-observer variability of renal blood
   oxygenation level-dependent MRI (BOLD-MRI) using a new method of
   analysis, called the concentric objects (CO) technique, in comparison
   with the classical ROI (region of interest)- based technique.
   Methods: MR imaging (3 T) was performed before and after furosemide in
   10 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients (mean eGFR 43 +/- 24
   ml/min/1.73 m(2)) and 10 healthy volunteers (eGFR 101 +/- 28 ml/min1.73
   m(2)), and R2* maps were determined on four coronal slices. In the
   CO-technique, R2* values were based on a semiautomatic procedure that
   divided each kidney in six equal layers, whereas in the ROI-technique,
   all circles (ROIs) were placed manually in the cortex and medulla. The
   mean R2*values as assessed by two independent investigators were
   compared.
   Results: With the CO-technique, inter-observer variability was 0.7%-1.9%
   across all layers in non-CKD, versus 1.6%-3.8% in CKD. With the
   ROI-technique, median variability for cortical and medullary 82* values
   was 3.6 and 6.8% in non-CKD, versus 4.7 and 125% in CKD; similar results
   were observed after furosemide.
   Conclusion: The CO-technique offers a new, investigator-independent,
   highly reproducible alternative to the ROI-based technique to estimate
   renal tissue oxygenation in CKD. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB BACKGROUND: A lack of consistent guidelines regarding mammographic
   compression has led to wide variation in its technical execution. Breast
   compression is accomplished by means of a compression paddle, resulting
   in a certain contact area between the paddle and the breast. This
   procedure is associated with varying levels of discomfort or pain. On
   current mammography systems, the only mechanical parameter available in
   estimating the degree of compression is the physical entity of force
   (daN). Recently, researchers have suggested that pressure (kPa),
   resulting from a specific force divided by contact area on a breast,
   might be a more appropriate parameter for standardization. Software has
   now become available which enables device-independent cross-comparisons
   of key mammographic metrics, such as applied compression pressure (force
   divided by contact area), breast density and radiation dose, between
   patient populations.
   PURPOSE: To compare the current compression practice in mammography
   between different imaging sites in the Netherlands and the United States
   from a mechanical point of view, and to investigate whether the
   compression protocols in these countries can be improved by
   standardization of pressure (kPa) as an objective mechanical parameter.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied the available
   parameters of a set of 37,518 mammographic compressions (9188 women)
   from the Dutch national breast cancer screening programme (NL data set)
   and of another set of 7171 compressions (1851 women) from a breast
   imaging centre in Pittsburgh, PA (US data set). Both sets were processed
   using VolparaAnalytics and VolparaDensity to obtain the applied average
   force, pressure, breast thickness, breast volume, breast density and
   average glandular dose (AGD) as a function of the size of the contact
   area between the breast and the paddle.
   RESULTS: On average, the forces and pressures applied in the NL data set
   were significantly higher than in the US data set. The relative standard
   deviation was larger in the US data set than in the NL data set. Breasts
   were compressed with a force in the high range of >15daN for 31.1% and
   >20kPa for 12.3% of the NL data set versus, respectively, 1.5% and 1.7%
   of the US data set. In the low range we encountered compressions with a
   pressure of <5daN for 21.1% and <5kPa for 21.7% of the US data set
   versus, respectively, 0.05% and 0.6% in the NL data set. Both the
   average and the standard deviation of the AGD were higher in the US data
   set.
   CONCLUSION: (1) Current mammographic breast compression policies lead to
   a wide range of applied forces and pressures, with large variations both
   within and between clinical sites. (2) Pressure standardization could
   decrease variation, improve reproducibility, and reduce the risk of
   unnecessary pain, unnecessary high radiation doses and inadequate image
   quality.

AB A reversed phase liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method
   was developed and validated for quantification of cardamonin, a
   potential anticancer chalcone, in rat serum. Curcumin was used as an
   internal standard. Following liquid-liquid extraction using n-hexane and
   ethyl acetate (60:40, v/v), the processed samples were chromatographed
   on a C18 column using acetonitrile and ammonium acetate buffer (0.01M,
   pH 4.5) (85:15, v/v) as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.6mLmin(-1).
   Mass spectrometric detection was performed in the negative electrospray
   ionization mode by multiple reaction monitoring (m/z 269122 and 367217
   for cardamonin and curcumin, respectively). The method was validated in
   terms of selectivity, accuracy, precision, sensitivity, reproducibility,
   dilution integrity and stability. The linearity was established in the
   range of 1-200ngmL(-1) (r≥0.999). The recovery of cardamonin from spiked
   serum was always >90%. The intra- and inter-day precision (%RSD) and
   accuracy (%bias) were well within the acceptable limits. The method was
   applied for single oral and intravenous dose pharmacokinetics in male
   and female Sprague Dawley rats. Following oral dose, cardamonin showed
   peak serum concentration that occurred at 2h with very low
   bioavailability in both male (0.6%) and female (4.8%) rats. Cardamonin
   exhibited a significant gender influence on pharmacokinetics and
   bioavailability in rats.

   and manual quantification as well as semiquantitative analysis for MRI
   synovitis, bone marrow edema-like lesions, erosion and cartilage loss of

   Wrist MRI was performed at 3 T in 16 patients with RA. Synovial volume
   and perfusion, bone marrow edema-like lesion (BMEL) volume, signal
   intensity and perfusion, and erosion dimensions were measured manually
   and using an in-house-developed automated software algorithm; findings
   were correlated with the OMERAC-RAMRIS gradings. In addition, a
   semiquantitative MRI cartilage loss score system was developed.
   Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to test the
   reproducibility of these quantitative and semiquantitative techniques.
   Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated between lesion
   quantifications and RAMRIS and between the MRI cartilage score and
   radiographic Sharp van der Heijde joint space narrowing scores.
   The intra- and interobserver ICCs were excellent for synovial, BMEL and
   erosion quantifications and cartilage loss grading (all > 0.89). The
   synovial volume, BMEL volume and signal intensity, and erosion
   dimensions were significantly correlated with the corresponding RAMRIS
   (r = 0.727 to 0.900, p < 0.05). Synovial perfusion parameter maximum
   enhancement (Emax) was significantly correlated with synovitis RAMRIS (r
   = 0.798). BMEL perfusion parameters were not correlated with the RAMRIS
   BME score. Cartilage loss gradings from MRI were significantly
   correlated with the Sharp joint space narrowing scores (r = 0.635, p =
   0.008).
   The computer-aided, manual and semiquantitative methods presented in
   this study can be used to evaluate MRI pathologies in RA with excellent
   reproducibility. Significant correlations with standard RAMRIS were
   found in the measurements using these methods.

AB The trabecular bone score (TBS) accounts for the bone microarchitecture
   and is calculated on dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). We
   estimated the reproducibility of the TBS using different scan modes
   compared to the reproducibility bone mineral density (BMD).
   A spine phantom was used with a Hologic QDR-Discovery A densitometer.
   For each scan mode [fast array, array, high definition (HD)], 25 scans
   were automatically performed without phantom repositioning; a further 25
   scans were performed with phantom repositioning. For each scan, the TBS
   was obtained. The coefficient of variation (CoV) was calculated as the
   ratio between standard deviation and mean; percent least significant
   change (LSC%) as 2.8xCoV; reproducibility as the complement to 100 % of
   LSC%. Differences among scan modes were assessed using ANOVA.
   Without phantom repositioning, the mean TBS (mm(-1)) was: 1.352 (fast
   array), 1.321 (array), and 1.360 (HD); with phantom repositioning, it
   was 1.345, 1.332, and 1.362, respectively. Reproducibility of the TBS
   without phantom repositioning was 97.7 % (fast array), 98.3 % (array),
   and 98.2 % (HD); with phantom repositioning, it was 97.9 %, 98.7 %, and
   98.4 %, respectively. LSC% was a parts per thousand currency sign2.26 %.
   Differences among scan modes were all statistically significant (p a
   parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand 0.019).
   Reproducibility of BMD was 99.1 % with all scan modes, while LSC% was
   from 0.86 % to 0.91 %.
   Reproducibility error of the TBS was 2-3-fold higher than that of BMD.
   Although statistically significant, differences in TBS among scan modes
   were within the highest LSC%. Thus, the three scan modes can be
   considered interchangeable.

   measurements in clinical practice. For that purpose, a confidence index
   based on temporal stability and SWE filling was defined to provide an

   With this index, the intra-observer acquisition variability assessed by
   comparing consecutive scans of the same patient was 17% and 32% for HG
   and LG clips, respectively. The measurement quantification variability
   assessed by comparing the measurements of a radiologist with those of a

AB A sonoporation device dedicated to the adherent cell monolayer has been
   implemented with a regulation process allowing the real-time monitoring
   and control of inertial cavitation activity. Use of the
   cavitation-regulated device revealed first that adherent cell
   sonoporation efficiency is related to inertial cavitation activity,
   without inducing additional cell mortality. Reproducibility is enhanced
   for the highest sonoporation rates (up to 17%); sonoporation efficiency
   can reach 26% when advantage is taken of the standing wave acoustic
   configuration by applying a frequency sweep with ultrasound frequency
   tuned to the modal acoustic modes of the cavity. This device allows
   sonoporation of adherent and suspended cells, and the use of regulation

AB Carbon nanotubes have been intensively researched for electronic
   applications, driven by their excellent electronic properties, where the
   goals are control and reproducibility of growth, semiconducting/metallic
   type selectivity and maintaining high quality of carbon nanotubes, in a
   process that is temperature-compatible with the electronics.
   Photo-thermal chemical vapour deposition can achieve these goals and,
   through a thorough investigation of the parameter space, we achieve very
   high nanotube-quality and growth rates, and produce a phase-diagram that
   reveals distinct regions for growing semiconducting and metallic
   single-walled nanotubes, as well as multi-walled. Correlation with the
   carbon-catalyst phase diagram allows for the development of a novel
   growth model. We propose that the temperature-gradient induces carbon
   diffusivity-gradient across the catalyst to yield the high growth rate.
   This is attributed to the increase of a-iron of catalyst. The growth
   control demonstrated here allows for integration of the nanotube growth
   process by photo-thermal deposition into mainstream electronics
   manufacture. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The preparation of a stable nanoparticle stock suspension is the first
   step in nanotoxicological studies, but how different preparation methods
   influence the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles in a solution,
   even in Milli-Q water, is often under-appreciated. In this study, a
   systematic approach using a central composite design (CCD) was employed
   to investigate the effects of sonication time and suspension
   concentration on the physicochemical properties (i.e. hydrodynamic
   diameter, zeta potential and ion dissolution) of silver (Ag) and copper
   oxide (CuO) nanoparticles (NPs) and to identify optimal conditions for
   suspension preparation in Milli-Q water; defined as giving the smallest
   particle sizes, highest suspension stability and lowest ion dissolution.
   Indeed, all the physicochemical properties of AgNPs and CuONPs varied
   dramatically depending on how the stock suspensions were prepared and
   differed profoundly between nanoparticle types, indicating the
   importance of suspension preparation. Moreover, the physicochemical
   properties of AgNPs and CuONPs, at least in simple media (Milli-Qwater),
   behaved in predictable ways as a function of sonication time and
   suspension concentration, confirming the validity of our models.
   Overall, the approach allows systematic assessment of the influence of
   various factors on key properties of nanoparticle suspensions, which
   will facilitate optimization of the preparation of nanoparticle stock
   suspensions and improve the reproducibility of nanotoxicological
   results. We recommend that further attention be given to details of
   stock suspension preparation before conducting nanotoxicological studies
   as these can have an important influence on the behavior and subsequent
   toxicity of nanoparticles. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the field of large-scale distributed systems, experimentation is
   particularly difficult. The studied systems are complex, often
   nondeterministic and unreliable, software is plagued with bugs, whereas
   the experiment workflows are unclear and hard to reproduce. These
   obstacles led many independent researchers to design tools to control
   their experiments, boost productivity and improve quality of scientific
   results.
   Despite much research in the domain of distributed systems experiment
   management, the current fragmentation of efforts asks for a general
   analysis. We therefore propose to build a framework to uncover missing
   functionality of these tools, enable meaningful comparisons between them
   and find recommendations for future improvements and research.
   The contribution in this paper is twofold. First, we provide an
   extensive list of features offered by general-purpose experiment
   management tools dedicated to distributed systems research on real
   platforms. We then use it to assess existing solutions and compare them,
   outlining possible future paths for improvements. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB The availability of sensitive, reproducible and stable substrate is
   critically important for surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-based
   application, but it still remains a challenge up to now. In this work,
   urchin-like LaVO4 microspheres prepared by a hydrothermal method were
   used as a template to fabricate SERS substrate by deposition of Au
   nanoparticle onto the surfaces of LaVO4 microspheres. The coverage of Au
   nanoparticles on the surfaces of LaVO4 microspheres can be easily
   controlled by varying the amount of Au precursor. SERS measurement
   showed that the coverage of Au nanoparticles on the surfaces of LaVO4
   microspheres had a great effect on SERS activity. The SERS signals
   collected from 80 microspheres indicated that as-prepared SERS substrate
   exhibited a good reproducibility. Detection of melamine molecules with a
   low concentration (1.0 x 10(-9) M) was used as an example to show the
   possible application of such substrate. In addition, the effect of iron
   ion (Fe3+) on detection melamine from the mixture of melamine and
   benzoic acid was also investigated. It was found that the interference
   of benzoic acid in detecting melamine from the mixture can be removed by
   adding Fe3+. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Nano-Ag particles were coated with colloidal carbon (Ag@C) to improve
   its biocompatibility and chemical stability for the preparation of
   biosensor. The core-shell structure was evidenced by transmission
   electron microscope (TEM) and the Fourier transfer infrared (FTIR)
   spectra revealed that the carbon shell is rich of function groups such
   as - OH and - COOH. The as-prepared Ag@C core-shell structure can offer
   favorable microenvironment for immobilizing glucose oxidase and the
   direct electrochemistry process of glucose oxidase (GOD) at Ag@C
   modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was realized. The modified
   electrode exhibited good response to glucose. Under optimum experimental
   conditions the biosensor linearly responded to glucose concentration in
   the range of 0.05-2.5 mM, with a detection limit of 0.02 mM (S/N = 3).
   The apparent Michaelis-Menten constant ( KMapp) of the biosensor is
   calculated to be 1.7 mM, suggesting high enzymatic activity and affinity
   toward glucose. In addition, the GOD-Ag@C/Nafion/GCE shows good
   reproducibility and long-term stability. These results suggested that
   core-shell structured Ag@C is an ideal matrix for the immobilization of
   the redox enzymes and further the construction of the sensitive enzyme
   biosensor. [All rights reserved Elsevier].

AB Up to now, there has been no report on target molecules detection by a
   piezoresistive microcantilever aptasensor. In order to evaluate the test
   performance and investigate the response dynamic characteristics of a
   piezoresistive microcantilever aptasensor, a novel method for ricin
   detection and kinetic analysis based on a piezoresistive microcantilever
   aptasensor was proposed, where ricin aptamer was immobilised on the
   microcantilever surface by biotin-avidin binding system. Results showed
   that the detection limit of ricin was 0.04mug L -1 (S/N ges 3). A linear
   relationship between the response voltage and the concentration of ricin
   in the range of 0.2mug L -1-40mug L -1 was obtained, with the linear
   regression equation of DeltaU e = 0.904C + 5.852 ( n = 5,  R = 0.991,  p
   < 0.001). The sensor showed no response for abrin, BSA, and could
   overcome the influence of complex environmental disruptors, indicating
   high specificity and good selectivity. Recovery and reproducibility in
   the result of simulated samples (simulated water, soil, and flour
   sample) determination met the analysis requirements, which was
   90.5~95.5% and 7.85%~9.39%, respectively. On this basis, a reaction
   kinetic model based on ligand-receptor binding and the relationship with
   response voltage was established. The model could well reflect the
   dynamic response of the sensor. The correlation coefficient (R) was
   greater than or equal to 0.9456 ( p < 0.001). Response voltage (DeltaU
   e) and response time (t 0) obtained from the fitting equation on
   different concentrations of ricin fitted well with the measured values.

   (191.05-379.08 mg/100 g oil) when compared to seed oils recovered from
   crab apples (130.55-202.54 mg/100 g oil). The predominant homologues of
   tocopherol in all the studied samples were alpha and beta over gamma and
   delta. However, seed oils recovered from the apple cultivars 'Antej' and
   'Beforest' had a unique profile of four tocopherol homologues (alpha:

   114.55:112.84:78.69:73.00 mg/100 g oil, respectively. A single dilution
   of seed oils in 2-propanol facilitated the direct use samples in the

   (pentafluorophenyl) column, which resulted in a rapid separation of all

AB The aim of this research was to develop a method for microextraction and
   quantification of long and medium chain fatty acids from milk. The
   proposed method was carried out on three steps: (1) lipids extraction
   from 10 mu L of whole or skimmed milk containing omega-3 fatty acids
   (FAs) during 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h, in 2 mL chloroform: methanol
   mixture (2: 1); (2) acid methylation of FAs; and (3) quantification of
   FAs methyl esters by gas chromatography. Using this method, the
   percentage recovery of FAs was higher (67% for whole and 85% for skimmed
   milk) compared with AOAC method 905.02 recovery (49% and 83%,
   respectively). Good reproducibility and repeatability (< 3%) were
   obtained. The method developed can be useful for researching and in
   routine quality control. Additionally, it is simpler, faster and cheaper
   than the reference procedure since it requires minimum sample and
   solvents volume as well as fewer steps. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

   diatoms and sponges. In this work, we have studied the effect of bovine
   serum albumin (BSA) as a template to direct the synthesis of silica
   nanoparticles (NPs) with the potential to associate proteins on its
   surface. Our approach enables the formation of spheres with different
   physicochemical properties. Particles using BSA as a protein template
   were smaller (250-380 nm) and were more monodisperse than those lacking
   the proteic core (700-1000 nm) as seen by dynamic light scattering
   (DLS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and environmental scanning
   electron microscopy (ESEM) analysis. The absence of BSA during synthesis
   produced silica nanoparticles without any porosity that was detectable
   by nitrogen adsorption, whereas particles containing BSA developed
   porosity in the range of 4 to 5 nm which collapsed on the removal of
   BSA, thus producing smaller pores. These results were in accordance with
   the pore size calculated by high-resolution transmission electron
   microscopy (HTEM). The reproducibility of the BSA-templated nanoparticle
   properties was determined by analyzing four batches of independent
   synthesizing experiments that maintained their properties. The high
   positive superficial charge of the nanoparticles facilitated adsorption
   under mild conditions of a range of proteins from an E. coli extract and
   a commercial preparation of laccase from Trametes versicolor. All of the
   proteins were quantitatively desorbed. Experiments conducted showed the
   reusability of the particles as supports for the ionic adsorption of the
   biomolecules. The protein loading capacity of the BSA-based biomimetic
   particles was determined using laccase as 98.7 ± 6.6 mg·g(-1) of

   toward BPA. CS also exhibits excellent film forming ability and improves
   the electrochemical behavior of MWCNT/GONRs modified electrode. The
   sensor displays a sensitive response to BPA within a wide concentration

   electrochemical performance was observed in both cyclic voltammetry (CV)
   and square wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV) compared to that of
   merely activated SPGE. To detect lead and copper qualitatively and
   quantitatively, deposition potential and deposition time were

   presented a sensitivity of 0.154 mu A/ppb and 0.084 mu A/ppb towards
   lead and copper with a correlation coefficient of 0.9792 and 0.9896.
   GNPs modified SPGE revealed a wide detection range of lead from 20 ppb
   to 200 ppb with a limit of detection of 2.2 ppb and copper from 20 ppb
   to 300 ppb with a limit of detection of 1.6 ppb. Reproducibility and
   consistency of different GNPs modified SPGEs were investigated to verify
   the performance. The electrochemical behaviour of integrated
   pseudo-reference and counter electrode was compared with that of
   commercial electrodes in detail. The results exhibited a reliable
   approach for lead and copper detection simultaneously with high
   sensitivity, linearity and low limit of detection. (C) 2014 Elsevier

AB This paper reports the response behavior at room temperature of a
   composite sensor composed of single-walled nanotubes (SWCNTs) and
   polyaniline, to the nerve agent simulant gas dimethyl-methylphosphonate
   (DMMP), a typical Sarin simulant. The SWCNT-polyaniline composite was
   synthesized to obtain high-quality composites with good uniformity. The
   composites were drop-cast onto an oxidized Si substrate patterned with
   Pd electrodes. SWCNT-polyaniline composite sensors exhibited clear,
   sharp response curves for DMMP in air at room temperature, even at
   minuscule concentrations. The response and response time were 27.1% and
   5.5 s, respectively, at 10 ppm DMMP, representing a significant
   improvement over the pure SWCNT network sensors previously reported.
   These results indicate that SWCNT-polyaniline composite sensors can be
   ideal DMMP sensors, operating at room temperature with high response,
   fast response time, and excellent reproducibility. (C) 2014 Published by

AB Recently, two-dimensional transition-metal chalcogenides attract
   increasing interest because of their remarkable structural and
   electronic properties. In this work, acetylene black (AB) incorporated
   CuS nanosheets are synthesized via a simple solvothermal route assisted
   by ethylene glycol. The obtained sample is characterized by scanning
   electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction
   and Raman spectra. A novel DNA electrochemical biosensor is fabricated
   with the DNA labeled at 5 end using 6-mercapto-1-hexhane immobilized on
   the CuS-AB/Au nanoparticles modified electrode through Au-S interaction.
   After blocked with 6-mercapto-1-hexanol, the probe DNA is bound with the
   addition of target DNA to form the double-stranded structure on the
   electrode surface, which leads to a significantly decrease of peak
   current of electrochemical indicator [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-). Under optimum
   conditions, the amperometric signals decrease linearly with the target
   DNA concentrations (0.1 pM-1 nM), and the DNA sensor exhibits a
   detection limit as low as 20 fM (3 sigma/S) with an excellent
   differentiation ability. The proposed method also shows acceptable
   stability and reproducibility. The good analytical performance can be
   attributed to the synergistic effect of acetylene black and the unique
   microstructure of CuS nanosheets. This can open up new opportunities for
   sensitive and selective detection of specific sequence DNA and provide a
   promising platform for sensor or biosensor designs for other
   biomoleculars detection. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   applied for sensitive detection of dopamine. The double sided conductive
   carbon tape supported by ITO glass was modified with multi-wall carbon
   nanotubes and Nafion followed by treatment with oxygen plasma before it
   was used as the working electrodes to detect dopamine. Nafion could not
   only improve selectivity for the detection of dopamine by stopping
   ascorbic acid from reaching the electrode surface but also enhance
   electrochemical signals of dopamine. In addition, the effective area of
   the carbon tape electrode could remarkably influence the signal-noise
   ratio and reproducibility. Under optimized experimental conditions, the
   linear range of dopamine was measured to be from 10 nM to 1 mu M. The
   integrated paper-based electroanalytical devices with the advantage of
   low sample volume could be applied for determination of dopamine

AB Dendritic Au-Ag bimetallic nanoparticles with chemiluminescence (CL)
   activity were synthesized by the seed-assisted approach for the first
   time. In this approach, luminol (CL reagent) as reducing agent was
   employed to reduce chloroauric acid in the presence of silver
   nanoparticles seeds to form dendritic Au-Ag bimetallic nanoparticles.
   The as-prepared dendritic Au-Ag bimetallic nanoparticles had well
   defined dendritic morphology with an average diameter of 60 nm.
   Moreover, the obtained bimetallic nanoparticles could react with
   hydrogen peroxide that was generated by the enzymatic oxidation between
   D-glucose and glucose oxidase (GOx), producing a strong CL emission in
   the presence of horseradish peroxidase as an effective CL catalyst. On
   this basis, a sensitive and selective assay was proposed for the
   detection of D-glucose. The D-glucose could be determined by CL signal
   in the range from 1 mu M to 1 mM with a detection limit of 0.4 mu M.
   This work not only prepared a novel functionalized nanomaterial, but
   also provided a new assay for the detection of D-glucose with high

   carbon (GC) electrode was examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV),
   differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), chronoamperometry and square wave
   voltammetry (SWV) in a pH 7.0 phosphate buffer. By combining the
   benefits of nZnO-MWCNT composite and GC electrode, the resulting
   modified electrode exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic behavior
   towards oxidation of triclosan by giving higher currents and lower
   oxidation peak potential compared to the bare GC electrode, nZnO and
   MWCNT modified electrodes. The effects of various parameters on the
   voltammetric response of triclosan were investigated. Under optimized
   conditions, the resulting sensor offered an excellent response for
   triclosan in the concentration range from 1.5 mu g L-1 to 2.0 mg L-1
   with detection limit of 1.3 mu g L-1 and a coefficient of determination
   (R-2) of 0.9931. The diffusion coefficient of triclosan was determined
   to be 1.65 x 10(-6) cm(2) s(-1). The electrochemical sensor showed
   satisfactory stability, selectivity and reproducibility when stored

   extremely high electrochemical response with high sensitivity (1052.8 mu

   nanostructures. The excellent sensing performance can be attributed to
   the unique surface architectures, which enhanced the electron transfer
   rate and the molecular approach during the electrochemical sensing of

TI StimDuino: An Arduino-based electrophysiological stimulus isolator
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS
VL 243
BP 8
EP 17
PD MAR 30 2015
PY 2015
AB Background: Electrical stimulus isolator is a widely used device in
   electrophysiology. The timing of the stimulus application is usually
   automated and controlled by the external device or acquisition software;
   however, the intensity of the stimulus is adjusted manually. Inaccuracy,
   lack of reproducibility and no automation of the experimental protocol
   are disadvantages of the manual adjustment. To overcome these
   shortcomings, we developed StimDuino, an inexpensive Arduino-controlled
   stimulus isolator allowing highly accurate, reproducible automated
   setting of the stimulation current.
   New method: The intensity of the stimulation current delivered by
   StimDuino is controlled by Arduino, an open-source microcontroller
   development platform. The automatic stimulation patterns are
   software-controlled and the parameters are set from Matlab-coded simple,
   intuitive and user-friendly graphical user interface. The software also
   allows remote control of the device over the network.
   Results: Electrical current measurements showed that StimDuino produces
   the requested current output with high accuracy. In both hippocampal
   slice and in vivo recordings, the fEPSP measurements obtained with
   StimDuino and the commercial stimulus isolators showed high correlation.
   Comparison with existing methods: Commercial stimulus isolators are
   manually managed, while StimDuino generates automatic stimulation
   patterns with increasing current intensity. The pattern is utilized for
   the input output relationship analysis, necessary for assessment of
   excitability. In contrast to StimuDuino, not all commercial devices are
   capable for remote control of the parameters and stimulation process.
   Conclusions: StimDuino-generated automation of the input output
   relationship assessment eliminates need for the current intensity
   manually adjusting, improves stimulation reproducibility, accuracy and
   allows on-site and remote control of the stimulation parameters. (C)

   properties, such as the magnetic anisotropy, of an individual Fe-4 SMM.
   The different approaches comprise first and higher order transport
   through the molecule. Gate spectroscopy, focusing on the charge
   degeneracy-point, is presented as a robust technique to quantify the
   longitudinal magnetic anisotropy of the SMM in different redox states.
   We provide statistics showing the robustness and reproducibility of the
   different methods. In addition, conductance measurements typically show
   high-energy excited states well beyond the ground spin multiplet of SMM.
   Some of these excitations have their origin in excited spin multiplets,
   others in vibrational modes of the molecule. The interplay between
   vibrations, charge and spin may yield a new approach for spin control.

   labeling (GRIL) using [C-12]- and [C-13]-coded aniline and zwitterionic
   hydrophilic interaction capillary liquid chromatography electro-spray
   mass spectrometry (mu ZIC-HILIC-ESI-MS) for relative quantitation of
   glycosylation variants in selected glycoproteins present in samples from
   cancer patients. Human alpha(1)-acid-glycoprotein (hAGP) is an acute
   phase serum glycoprotein whose glycosylation has been described to be
   altered in cancer and chronic inflammation. However, it is not clear yet
   whether some particular glycans in hAGP can be used as biomarker for
   differentiating between these two pathologies. In this work, hAGP was
   isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography (IAC) from serum samples of
   healthy individuals and from those suffering chronic pancreatitis and
   different stages of pancreatic cancer, respectively. After
   de-N-glycosylation, relative quantitation of the hAGP glycans was
   carried out using stable isotope labeling and mu ZIC-HILIC-ESI-MS
   analysis. First, protein denaturing conditions prior to PNGase F
   digestion were optimized to achieve quantitative digestion yields, and
   the reproducibility of the established methodology was evaluated with
   standard hAGP. Then, the proposed method was applied to the analysis of
   the clinical samples (control vs. pathological). Pancreatic cancer
   samples clearly showed an increase in the abundance of fucosylated
   glycans as the stage of the disease increases and this was unlike to
   samples from chronic pancreatitis. The results gained here indicate the
   mentioned glycan in hAGP as a candidate structure worth to be
   corroborated by an extended study including more clinical cases;
   especially those with chronic pancreatitis and initial stages of
   pancreatic cancer. Importantly, the results demonstrate that the
   presented methodology combining an enrichment of a target protein by IAC
   with isotope coded relative quantitation of N-glycans can be
   successfully used for targeted glycomics studies. The methodology is
   assumed being suitable as well for other such studies aimed at finding
   novel cancer associated glycoprotein biomarkers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

   developed and validated for the quantitation of BMS-791325 and its
   active N-demethyl metabolite (BMS-794712) in human plasma and urine.
   Plasma and urine samples were extracted with methyl-t-butyl ether
   followed by an LC-MS/MS analysis which was conducted in a multiple
   reaction monitoring (MRM) mode for the simultaneous detection of the two
   analytes in human plasma (0.1-50 ng/mL) and in human urine (5-2500
   ng/mL). Intra-run precision (3.0% R.S.D.), inter-run precision (5.3%
   R.S.D.), and accuracy (+/- 4.7% deviation) from plasma and urine quality
   control samples provide evidence of the methods accuracy and precision.
   Selectivity, stability in matrices, extraction recovery, matrix effect
   on LC-MS detection, and interference of coadministered drugs (famotidine
   and ritonavir) were all acceptable. Reproducibility of the plasma method
   was demonstrated by reanalysis of a portion of study samples. The
   results of cross-validations demonstrated the equivalency of two methods
   validated in two labs. The plasma method was applied to the analysis of
   several thousand clinical study samples for PK evaluations of the drug

   in human plasma was established and validated using liquid
   chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry.
   Perampanel and an internal standard were extracted from human plasma
   (100 mu l) by liquid extraction using methyl t-butyl ether, then
   evaporated and reconstituted. The chromatographic separation was
   conducted on a C8 column with isocratic elution at a flow rate of 0.2
   mL/min. The established method showed linearity in the range 0.25-200
   ng/mL with correlation coefficients of >0.99 that could be extended
   10-fold as validated by dilution integrity analyses. No significant
   endogenous peaks were detected in the elution of analytes in blank human
   plasma and no significant matrix effect was observed. The intra- and
   inter-batch reproducibility analyses demonstrated accuracy and precision
   within the acceptance criteria.
   To check the impact of anti-epileptic drugs on the perampanel assay,

   for the simultaneous determination of lenalidomide, ibrutinib, and its

   ibrutinib, PCI45227 and tolbutamide (internal standard; IS) from 50 mu I
   rat plasma was carried out by liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl
   acetate:dichloromethane (90:10) ratio. Chromatographic separation of
   analytes was performed on YMC pack ODS AM (150 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 mu m)
   column under gradient conditions with acetonitrile:0.1% formic acid
   buffer as the mobile phases at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Precursor ion
   and product ion transition for analytes and IS were monitored on a
   triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, operated in the selective reaction
   monitoring with positive ionization mode. Method was validated over a
   concentration range of 0.72-183.20 ng/ml for ibrutinib, 0.76-194.33
   ng/ml for PCI-45227 and 1.87-479.16 ng/ml for lenalidomide. Mean
   extraction recovery for ibrutinib, PCI-45227, lenalidomide and IS of
   75.2%, 84.5%, 97.3% and 92.3% were consistent across low, medium, and
   high QC levels. Precision and accuracy at low, medium and high quality
   control levels were less than 15% across analytes. Bench top, wet,
   freeze-thaw and long term stability was evaluated for all the analytes.
   The analytical method was applied to support a pharmacokinetic study of

   conducted in a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The lower limits
   of quantitation (LLOQ) were 1 ng/mL for daclatasvir, asunaprevir, and
   BMS-794712, and 2 ng/mL for beclabuvir. Intra-run precision (<= 4.5%
   CV), inter-run precision (<= 2.9% CV), and accuracy (+/- 5.3% deviation)
   based on different concentration levels (low, geometric mean, mid and
   high) of the quality control samples (QCs) provided evidence of the
   methods accuracy and precision. Selectivity and matrix effect on
   LC-MS/MS detection, stability in plasma, and potential interference of
   coadministered drugs (ribavirin and interferon) were all evaluated and
   the results were acceptable. Method reproducibility was demonstrated by
   the reanalysis of a portion of study samples. The cross-validation
   results for QCs demonstrated the equivalency between this method and two
   single-analyte methods which were previously validated for quantitation
   of daclatasvir in human plasma. This approach of using a multiplexed
   LC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous quantitation of three DAAs is time-
   and cost-effective, and can maintain good data quality in sample
   analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   in both wine base (WB) and grape base (GB). Low limits of detection
   (0.1-5 ng/L in WB and 0.05-1.6 in GB) and quantitation (0.3-17 in WB and

   [4.3-9.8% coefficient of variation (CV) in WB and 5.1-11.1% CV in GB]
   and reproducibility (3.6-10.2 in WB and 1.9-10.9 in GB) indicate that

TI Discordance Between Echocardiography and MRI in the Assessment of Mitral
   Regurgitation Severity A Prospective Multicenter Trial

AB BACKGROUND The decision to undergo mitral valve surgery is often made on
   the basis of echocardiographic criteria and clinical assessment. Recent
   changes in treatment guidelines recommending surgery in asymptomatic
   patients make the accurate assessment of mitral regurgitation (MR)
   severity even more important.
   OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to compare echocardiography and
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the assessment of MR severity using
   the degree of left ventricular (LV) remodeling after surgery as the
   reference standard.
   METHODS In this prospective multicenter trial, MR severity was assessed
   in 103 patients using both echocardiography and MRI. Thirty-eight
   patients subsequently had isolated mitral valve surgery, and 26 of these
   had an additional MRI performed 5 to 7 months after surgery. The
   pre-surgical estimate of regurgitant severity was correlated with the
   postoperative decrease in LV end-diastolic volume.
   RESULTS Agreement between MRI and echocardiographic estimates of MR
   severity was modest in the overall cohort (r = 0.6; p < 0.0001), and
   there was a poorer correlation in the subset of patients sent for
   surgery (r = 0.4; p = 0.01). There was a strong correlation between
   post-surgical LV remodeling and MR severity as assessed by MRI (r =
   0.85; p < 0.0001), and no correlation between post-surgical LV
   remodeling and MR severity as assessed by echocardiography (r = 0.32; p
   = 0.1).
   CONCLUSIONS The data suggest that MRI is more accurate than
   echocardiography in assessing the severity of MR. MRI should be
   considered in those patients when MR severity as assessed by
   echocardiography is influencing important clinical decisions, such as
   the decision to undergo MR surgery. (C) 2015 by the American College of

AB Recently, solution-processable organic-inorganic metal halide
   perovskites have come to the fore as a result of their high
   power-conversion efficiencies (PCE) in photovoltaics, exceeding 17%. To
   attain reproducibility in the performance, one of the critical factors
   is the processing conditions of the perovskite film, which directly
   influences the photophysical properties and hence the device
   performance. Here we study the effect of annealing parameters on the
   crystal structure of the perovskite films and correlate these changes
   with its photophysical properties. We find that the crystal formation is
   kinetically driven by the annealing atmosphere, time and temperature.
   Annealing in air produces an improved crystallinity and large grain
   domains as compared to nitrogen. Lower photoluminescence quantum
   efficiency (PLQE) and shorter photoluminescence (PL) lifetimes are
   observed for nitrogen annealed perovskite films as compared to the
   air-annealed counterparts. We note that the limiting nonradiative
   pathways (i.e., maximizing PLQE) is important for obtaining the highest
   device efficiency. This indicates a critical impact of the atmosphere
   upon crystallization and the ultimate device performance.

   demanding tools in modern bio- and nanomedicine, joining both features
   in a single nanoparticle still remains a real challenge, despite the
   recent progress achieved, most of it within the last year. Here we
   demonstrate a successful realization of this challenge. The heating is
   magnetically induced, the temperature readout is optical, and the
   ratiometric thermometric probes are dual-emissive Eu(3+)/Tb(3+)
   lanthanide complexes. The low thermometer heat capacitance (0.021·K(-1))
   and heater/thermometer resistance (1 K·W(-1)), the high temperature
   sensitivity (5.8%·K(-1) at 296 K) and uncertainty (0.5 K), the
   physiological working temperature range (295-315 K), the readout
   reproducibility (>99.5%), and the fast time response (0.250 s) make the
   heater/thermometer nanoplatform proposed here unique. Cells were
   incubated with the nanoparticles, and fluorescence microscopy permits
   the mapping of the intracellular local temperature using the
   pixel-by-pixel ratio of the Eu(3+)/Tb(3+) intensities. Time-resolved
   thermometry under an ac magnetic field evidences the failure of using
   macroscopic thermal parameters to describe heat diffusion at the

AB Next-generation sequencing of the V1-V2 and V3 variable regions of the
   16S rRNA gene generated a total of 674,116 reads that described six
   distinct bacterial biofilm communities from both water meters and pipes.
   A high degree of reproducibility was demonstrated for the experimental
   and analytical work-flow by analyzing the communities present in
   parallel water meters, the rare occurrence of biological replicates
   within a working drinking water distribution system. The communities
   observed in water meters from households that did not complain about
   their drinking water were defined by sequences representing
   Proteobacteria (82-87%), with 22-40% of all sequences being classified
   as Sphingomonadaceae. However, a water meter biofilm community from a
   household with consumer reports of red water and flowing water
   containing elevated levels of iron and manganese had fewer sequences
   representing Proteobacteria (44%); only 0.6% of all sequences were
   classified as Sphingomonadaceae; and, in contrast to the other water
   meter communities, markedly more sequences represented Nitrospira and
   Pedomicrobium. The biofilm communities in pipes were distinct from those
   in water meters, and contained sequences that were identified as
   Mycobacterium, Nocardia, Desulfovibrio, and Sulfuricurvum. The approach
   employed in the present study resolved the bacterial diversity present
   in these biofilm communities as well as the differences that occurred in
   biofilms within a single distribution system, and suggests that
   next-generation sequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons can show changes in
   bacterial biofilm communities associated with different water qualities.

AB The paper presents a new in-line measurement technique for determining
   the coating thickness and uniformity of pharmaceutical pellets during
   film-coating in a fluid-bed apparatus. Non-destructive and contact-free
   process monitoring was performed via an optical coherence tomography
   (OCT) sensor providing cross-section images. Through the OCT
   measurements, the coating thickness could be determined directly,
   without a chemometric calibration model required for the quantification.
   The direct integration of the OCT sensor head into the fluid-bed systems
   allowed continuous monitoring of the coating growth. Moreover, the
   in-line investigation of the intra- and inter-pellet coating uniformity
   was possible due to OCT's high acquisition rate. Results of the in-line
   OCT measurements were validated using both off-line OCT images and
   particle size analysis by performing an image analysis of samples that
   were periodically removed from the process during the production. Three
   batches were produced under the same process conditions demonstrating
   the reproducibility of the results. Rather than providing the temporal
   and spatial average of a large number of pellets, the OCT sensor
   characterized local pellet properties of up to 130 individual pellets
   per minute. Therefore, the OCT technology allows the operator to
   directly monitor the coating thickness and uniformity in sub-micron
   resolution, which makes it a promising in-line PAT method. (C) 2014

AB Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a well-known carcinogenic contaminant in foods.
   It is classified as an extremely hazardous compound because of its
   potential toxicity to the human nervous system. AFB1 has also been
   extensively used as a biochemical marker to evaluate the degree of food
   spoilage. In this study, a novel surface-enhanced Raman scattering
   (SERS)-based immunoassay platform using silica-encapsulated hollow gold
   nanoparticles (SEHGNs) and magnetic beads was developed for highly
   sensitive detection of AFB1.SEHGNs were used as highly stable
   SERS-encoding nano tags, and magnetic beads were used as supporting
   substrates for the high-density loading of immunocomplexes. Quantitative
   analysis of AFB1 was performed by monitoring the intensity change of the
   characteristic peaks of Raman reporter molecules. The limit of detection
   (LOD) of AFB1, determined by this SERS-based immunoassay, was determined
   to be 0.1 ng/mL. This method has some advantages over other analytical
   methods with respect to rapid analysis (less than 30 min), good
   selectivity, and reproducibility. The proposed method is expected to be
   a new analytical tool for the trace analysis of various mycotoxins. (C)

AB Photodetectors using optically responsive graphene (Gr) or reduced

   for detection of broad band light including infrared (IR). However,
   there have been only a few reports on Gr or R-GO photodetectors with new
   functionalities such as optical transparency and/or flexibility. Herein,
   a new kind of transparent and flexible IR photodetector is presented
   using a field-effect transistor (FET) structure in which an
   IR-responsive nanocomposite layer of R-GO and
   poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) is employed
   as the channel. The IR photodetector exhibits high IR responsivity,
   stability, and reproducibility under mechanical strain and ambient
   conditions. In addition, the capability of measuring the distribution of
   responses from each device in the transparent and flexible nanocomposite
   FET array under IR radiation from the human body is also demonstrated.
   Therefore, the development of a flexible IR photodetector with high
   responsivity, transparency, ease of integration, and stability in an
   ambient environment is a suitable alternative approach for achieving the
   stable monitoring of IR in many flexible and transparent electronic
   systems.

AB Micro-Finite Element (micro-FE) analysis is now widely used in
   biomedical research as a tool to derive bone mechanical properties as
   they relate to its microstructure. With the development of in vivo
   high-resolution peripheral quantitative CT (HR-pQCT) scanners, it can
   now be applied to analyze bone in-vivo in the peripheral skeleton. In
   this survey, the results of several experimental and clinical studies
   are summarized that addressed the feasibility of this approach to
   predict bone strength in-vivo. Specific questions that will be addressed
   are: how accurate are strength predictions based on micro-FE; how
   reproducible are the results; and, is it a better predictor of bone
   fracture risk than DXA based measures? Based on results of experimental
   studies, it is first concluded that micro-FE based on HR-pQCT images can
   accurately predict the strength of the distal radius during a fall on
   the outstretched hand using either linear elastic analysis, implementing
   a 'Pistoia criterion' or similar criterion in combination with an
   'effective' Young's modulus or using non-linear analyses. When
   evaluating results of clinical reproducibility studies, it is concluded
   that for single-center studies, errors at the radius are less than 4.4%
   and 3.7% and at the tibia less than 3.6% and 2.3% for stiffness and
   strength, respectively. In multicenter trials, however, these errors can
   be increased by some 1.8% and 1.4% for stiffness and strength,
   respectively. Finally, based on the results of large cohort studies, it
   is concluded that micro-FE calculated stiffness better separates cases
   from controls than bone density parameters for subjects with fragility
   fractures at any site, but not for subjects with only radius fractures.
   In this latter case, however, combinations of micro-FE derived
   parameters can significantly improve the separation.

   several well-dispersed Pt NPs encapsulated in UiO-66 frameworks. But
   there were no obvious Pt NPs observed in the Pt NP5@UiO-66-1 sample, and
   for the Pt NP5@UiO-66-3 sample, the number of Pt NPs encapsulated in
   UiO-66 matrix notably reduced and the metal organic framework (MOF)
   crystals became small and aggregated. The electrochemical measurements
   showed that the Pt NP5@UiO-66-2 sample modified glass carbon electrode
   (GCE) presented a remarkable electrocatalytic activity toward hydrogen
   peroxide (H2O2) oxidation, including an excellent anti-interference
   performance even if the concentration of the interference species was
   the Same: as the H2O2, an extended linear range from 5 mu M to 14.75 mM,
   a low detection limit, as well as good stability and reptoducibility.
   The results indicate the superiority of MOFs hi H2O2 detection. And more
   importantly, it will provide a new opportunity to promote the

AB A workflow is designed for the analysis of lipoproteins, high density
   lipoproteins (HDL), apoproteins, and lipid fraction, employing an
   organic polymeric anion exchanger through the enrichment of
   lipoproteins/peptides from serum. Polymeric separation Media are
   Chemically stable over the wide pH range. Poly(GMA/DVB),
   poly(GMA/EGDMA), and poly(GPE/DVB) are synthesized by radical
   polymerization, derivatized as strong anion exchangers, and used for
   lipoproteins enrichment. Lipoprotein's surface is covered by
   phospholipids; having phosphate groups, therefore lipoproteins are
   enriched by the interaction of anion exchanger with the phosphate groups
   and eluted at the pH of 7.5. HDL are further isolated by precipitating
   the very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and low-density lipoproteins
   (LDL) With phosphotungstic acid as precipitating reagent, followed by
   delipidation via liquid/liquid extraction. Apolipoproteins profiling is
   done by MALDI-MS, and lipids are analyzed using gold nanoparticles in
   the LDI-MS process. This study introduces a lipoproteomics work flow in
   Separation science which analyses the intact lipoprbteins. Furthermore,
   solid phase extraction (SPE)-based methodology is reported for the first
   time in lipoproteomics. Use of organic polymers, high reproducibility,
   detailed analysis of lipoproteins, apoproteins/peptides, and lipids from
   the single serum sample are the distinctive features of this workflow.
   Being biomarkers of numerous diseases, lipoproteins have clinical
   significance, and this workflow can be used at diagnostic and

AB Background: Today, when more than 60% of animal diseases are zoonotic,
   understanding their origin and development and identifying protective
   immune responses in ruminants are major challenges. Robust, efficient
   and cost-effective tools are preconditions to solve these challenges.
   Cytokines play a key role in the main mechanisms by which the immune
   system is balanced in response to infectious pathogens. The cytokine
   balance has thus become the focus of research to characterize immune
   response in ruminants. Currently, SYBR Green reverse transcriptase
   quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is the most widely method used to investigate
   cytokine gene expression in ruminants, but the conditions in which the
   many assays are carried out vary considerably and need to be properly
   evaluated. Accordingly, the quantification of gene expression by RT-qPCR
   requires normalization by multiple reference genes. The objective of the
   present study was thus to develop an RT-qPCR assay to simultaneously
   quantify the expression of several cytokines and reference genes in
   three ruminant species. In this paper, we detail each stage of the
   experimental protocol, check validation parameters and report assay
   performances, following MIQE guidelines.
   Results: Ten novel primer sets were designed to quantify five cytokine
   genes (IL-4, IL-10, IL-12B, IFN-gamma and TNF-a) and five reference
   genes (ACTB, GAPDH, H3F3A, PPIA and YWHAZ) in cattle, sheep, and goats.
   All the primer sets were designed to span exon-exon boundaries and use
   the same hybridization temperature. Each stage of the RT-qPCR method was
   detailed; their specificity and efficiency checked, proved and are
   reported here, demonstrating the reproducibility of our method, which is
   capable of detecting low levels of cytokine mRNA up to one copy whatever
   the species. Finally, we checked the stability of candidate reference
   gene expression, performed absolute quantification of cytokine and
   reference gene mRNA in whole blood samples and relative expression of
   cytokine mRNA in stimulated PBMC samples.
   Conclusions: We have developed a novel RT-qPCR assay for the
   simultaneous relative quantification of five major cytokines in cattle,
   sheep and goats, and their accurate normalization by five reference
   genes. This accurate and easily reproducible tool can be used to
   investigate ruminant immune responses and is widely accessible to the
   veterinary research community.

AB Introduction: Dioxins are environmental and persistent pollutants mostly
   emitted from combustion facilities (e.g. waste incinerators, metal and
   cement industries). Known to be endocrine disrupting chemicals, dioxins
   are suspected to increase breast cancer (BC) risk. Although diet is
   considered the primary source of dioxin exposure, no previous study has
   been published on dietary dioxin exposure in relation to BC risk. We
   aimed to assess dietary dioxin exposure among women from the E3N cohort
   and estimate BC risk associated with this exposure.
   Methods: The study included 63,830 women from the E3N cohort who
   completed a diet history questionnaire (DHQ) in 1993 and were followed
   until 2008. Dietary dioxin exposure was estimated by combining
   consumption data from the E3N DHQ and food dioxin contamination data
   from a French national monitoring program. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95%
   confidence intervals (CI) were estimated by Cox models adjusted for BC
   risk factors.
   Results: Mean dietary dioxin exposure was estimated at 1.3 +/- 0.4 pg/kg
   body weight (BW)/day. A 0.4 pg/kg BW/d increase in dioxin intake was not
   associated with overall BC risk (HR = 1.00; 95% CI: 0.96, 1.05). A
   significant decrease in risk of estrogen receptor negative
   (ER-)/progesterone receptor negative (PR-) tumors was observed among
   post-menopausal women in the upper quartile of estimated dioxin intake
   (HR for Q4 vs. Q1: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.45, 0.96; P for trend across
   quartiles = 0.0463).
   Conclusions: Overall, no association between estimated dietary dioxin
   exposure and BC risk was found among E3N women. Further studies should
   include both dietary and environmental exposures to determine whether
   low-dose dioxin exposure is associated with BC risk.

   N-b-demethylalstogustine, and 0.78 and 2.62 mu g/mL for loganetin,
   respectively. Standard curves were linear in the range of 3-15 mu g/mL
   (r(2)=0.999). The method showed good repeatability (%RSD<1.14),
   reproducibility (%RSD<1.16), and recovery (mean%>99.48). This is the
   first report on loganetin isolation from A. scholaris. Furthermore,
   various extraction methods and parameters were investigated to optimize
   markers extraction from the sample matrix. Finally, the optimized
   extraction method was used in the extraction of markers from different

   of the "4-cell" module is 27 mW cm(-2) at 5 M methanol concentration.
   The steady-state performances of the modular stacks with different

   module stacks due to inter-module electrical connections is predicted by
   mathematical fitting method. The fitting results indicate that the
   efficiencies of the multiple module stacks are all above 90% up to 10
   modules. The dynamic performances of the modular stacks are also
   investigated for portable applications. The results show that the
   modular stacks exhibit good responsiveness and reproducibility at high

   chitosan/thionine matrix film (CSMCM) was simply fabricated. The CSMCM
   not only enhanced the loading capacity of the biomolecules and stability
   of the immunosensor by covalently immobilizing due to stable conjunction
   between S-bond of Ag2S shell and NH2-bond of biomolecules, but also
   provided a favorable microenvironment to maintain the activity of the

   with other references. Performance of the immunosensor was evaluated in
   terms of its detection limit, sensitivity, pH, time and temperature of

AB Evaporation and sputtering-deposition of noble metal films on substrates
   are two most popular and easiest methods for creating stable
   surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-active metal nanoparticles
   (NPs). However, intrinsically low SERS effect and unclearly inherent
   relationship between SEAS effect and surface roughness of created Au NPs
   make SERS-related applications are limited. Here, we present the
   enhanced SERS effect observed on Au nanoislands (AuNIs)-deposited
   substrates prepared by thermal evaporation and followed by
   post-annealing treatment (PAT). Experimental results indicate that the
   SERS intensity of Rhodamine 6G (R6G) adsorbed on AuNIs, corresponding to
   average particle diameter of ca. 220 nm and to mean roughness (Ra) of 50
   nm, can be increased by one order of magnitude after PAT at 700 degrees
   C. Meanwhile, the AuNIs (annealed at 700 degrees C)-deposited silicon
   substrate demonstrates a large enhancement factor (EF) of 2.2 x 10(7).
   The relative standard deviation is ca. 7% in SERS measurements. In
   addition, detailed relationships of Ra derived from analysis of atomic
   force microscopy (AFM) and SERS effect are correlated for metal
   particles smaller and larger than 300 nm. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

AB RATIONALE: PDO cheeses, such as Parmigiano Reggiano and Grana Padano,
   which cost more than double generic similar cheeses, must be protected
   against mislabelling. The aim of this study was to validate the methods
   for the isotopic and elemental analysis of cheese, in order to support
   official recognition of their use in authenticity assessment.
   METHODS: An international collaborative study based on blind duplicates
   of seven hard cheeses was performed according to the IUPAC protocol and
   ISO Standards 5725/2004 and 13528/2005. The H, C, N and S stable isotope
   ratios of defatted cheese determined using Isotope Ratio Mass
   Spectrometry (IRMS) and the content of Li, Na, Mn, Fe, Cu, Se, Rb, Sr,
   Mo, Ba, Re, Bi, U in cheese after acid microwave digestion using
   Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry or Optical Emission
   Spectrometry (ICP-MS or -OES) were measured in 13 different
   laboratories.
   RESULTS: The average standard deviations of repeatability (sr) and
   reproducibility (sR) were 0.1 and 0.2 % for delta C-13 values, 0.1 and
   0.3% for delta N-15 values, 2 and 3% for delta H-2 values, and 0.4 and
   0.6% for delta S-34 values, thus comparable with results of official
   methods and the literature for other food matrices. For elemental data,
   the average RSDr and RSDR values ranged between 2 and 11% and between 9
   and 28%, respectively, consistent with methods reported by the FDA and
   in the literature for cheese.
   CONCLUSIONS: The validation data obtained here can be submitted to the
   standardisation agencies to obtain official recognition for the methods,
   which is fundamental when they are used in commercial disputes and legal
   debates. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Normalizing the total urine concentration is important for minimizing
   bias in urinary metabolomics analysis comparisons. In this study, we
   report a matrix-induced ion suppression (MIIS)-based method to normalize
   concentration using flow injection analysis coupled with electrospray
   ionization mass spectrometry (FIA-ESI-MS). An ion suppression indicator
   (ISI) was spiked into urine samples, and the intensity of the extracted
   ion chromatogram(EIC) for ISI in a urine matrix was subtracted by the
   EIC for a blank solution and used to calculate the extent to which the
   signal was reduced by the urine matrix. A series dilution of pooled
   urine samples was used to correlate the urine concentration and level of
   ion suppression for ISI. A regression equation was used to estimate the
   relative concentration of unknown urine samples. The MIIS method was
   validated for linearity, precision and accuracy. We obtained a good
   correlation using a quadratic regression model for 1- to 32-fold urine
   dilutions (R-2 = 0.998). The reproducibility (n = 4) and intermediate
   precision (n = 3) were below 5% RSD, and the accuracy ranged from 97.15%
   to 102.10%. The established method was used to estimate the relative
   concentrations of 16 urine samples, and the results were compared with
   commonly used normalization methods. Pearson's correlation test was used
   to demonstrate that the MIIS method correlated highly with the
   creatinine and osmolarity methods; the correlation coefficients were
   0.93 and 0.99, respectively. We successfully applied this method to a
   urinary metabolomics study on breast cancer. This study demonstrated the
   MIIS method is simple, accurate and can contribute to data integrity in
   urinary metabolomics studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB In this work, a novel and convenient strategy was developed to prepare
   molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) on the surface of graphene sheet.
   In this route, vinyl group functionalized graphene (GR/NVC) was first
   prepared by immobilizing 4-vinylcarbazole onto the surface of graphene
   via p-p interaction. The subsequent grafting copolymerization of
   methacrylic acid and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate in the presence of
   4-nitrophenol (4-NP, template molecule) was carried out at GR/NVC
   surface, leading to the formation of GR/MIPs composite. The GR/MIPs
   composite was characterized by FTIR, fluorescence, TGA, SEM and AFM, and
   was used to fabricate electrochemical sensor for the detection of 4-NP.
   The electrochemical behavior of GR/MIPs sensor for 4-NP was investigated
   by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The
   effects of the preparation conditions, such as concentration of the NVC
   and template, the solution pH, and incubation time, were also optimized.
   Under optimized conditions, the DPV current response of GR/MIPs sensor
   was nearly 12 times than that of the GR/NIPs sensor. It also should be
   noted that as compared to traditional MIP, shorter response time and
   much higher current response were demonstrated. In addition, the GR/MIPs
   sensor could recognize 4-NP from its structural analogs, indicating the
   excellent selectivity of the GR/MIPs sensor. The peak current is
   linearly proportional to the concentration of 4-NP ranging from 0.01 mu
   M to 100 mu M and 200 mu M to 1000 mu M with a significantly low
   detection limit of 5 nM, a wider response range and lower detection
   limits as compared to most of the previously reported electrochemical
   sensors for 4-NP. Furthermore, the GR/MIPs sensor exhibits good
   stability with adequate reproducibility and has been successfully used
   to determine 4-NP in water samples. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB For pharmaceutical applications, the use of inorganic engineered
   nanoparticles is of growing interest while silver (Ag) and gold (Au) are
   the most relevant elements. A few methods were developed recently but
   the validation and the application testing were quite limited.
   Therefore, a routinely suitable multi element method for the
   identification of nanoparticles of different sizes below 100 nm and
   elemental composition by applying asymmetric flow field flow fraction
   (AF4) - inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) is
   developed. A complete validation model of the quantification of
   releasable pharmaceutical relevant inorganic nanoparticles based on Ag
   and Au is presented for the most relevant aqueous matrices of tap water
   and domestic waste water. The samples are originated from locations in
   the Netherlands and it is of great interest to study the unwanted
   presence of Ag and Au as nanoparticle residues due to possible health
   and environmental risks. During method development, instability effects
   are observed for 60 nm and 70 nm Ag ENPs with different capping agents.
   These effects are studied more closely in relation to matrix effects.
   Besides the methodological aspects, the obtained analytical results and
   relevant performance characteristics (e.g. measuring range, limit of
   detection, repeatability, reproducibility, trueness, and expanded
   uncertainty of measurement) are determined and discussed. For the chosen
   aqueous matrices, the results of the performance characteristics are
   significantly better for Au ENPs in comparison to Ag ENPs; e.g.
   repeatability and reproducibility are below 10% for all Au ENPs
   respectively maximal 27% repeatability for larger Ag ENPs. The method is
   a promising tool for the simultaneous determination of releasable
   pharmaceutical relevant inorganic nanoparticles. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Quantitative structure-property/activity relationships (QSPRs/QSARs) can
   be used to predict physicochemical and/or biochemical behavior of
   substances which were not studied experimentally. Typically predicted
   values for chemicals in the training set are accurate since they were
   used to build the model. QSPR/QSAR models must be validated before they
   are used in practice. Unfortunately, the majority of the suggested
   approaches of the validation of QSPR/QSAR models are based on
   consideration of geometrical features of clusters of data points in the
   plot of experimental versus calculated values of an endpoint. We believe
   these geometrical criteria can be more useful if they are analyzed for
   several splits into the training and test sets. In this way, one can
   estimate the reproducibility of the model with various splits and better
   evaluate model reliability. The probability of the correct prediction of
   an endpoint for external validation set (in the series of the
   above-mentioned splits) can provide an useful way to evaluate the domain
   of applicability of the model. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Background Cusp calcification is the main mechanism leading to
   bioprosthetic heart valve (BPV) failure. Recent studies suggest that BPV
   calcification is an active rather than passive process probably
   modulated by several mechanisms including lipid-mediated inflammation
   and dysfunctional phosphocalcic metabolism.
   Objective To identify the clinical and metabolic determinants of BPV
   calcification assessed by multidetector CT (MDCT).
   Methods and results Presence of BPV calcification was assessed by MDCT
   in 194 patients who had undergone aortic valve replacement. A
   calcification score was individually calculated and expressed in mm(3).
   Patients also underwent a clinical evaluation, a Doppler
   echocardiographic exam, and a plasma lipid and phosphocalcic profile. 46
   patients (24%) had BPV calcification (cusp calcification score > 0
   mm(3)). After adjustment for age, gender, and time interval since BPV
   implantation, increased calcium-phosphorus product (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.01
   to 1.23 per 1 unit; p= 0.02) and the presence of prosthesis-patient
   mismatch (OR 3.67, 95% CI 1.25 to 10.6; p= 0.01) were the strongest
   independent factors associated with BPV calcification. Calcium
   supplement intake, age and female gender were independently associated
   with increased calcium-phosphorus product.
   Conclusions This study suggests that higher calcium-phosphorus product
   and prosthesis-patient mismatch promote BPV calcification. Furthermore,
   this study reports that calcium supplements, which are extensively
   prescribed in elderly patients, are independently associated with higher
   calcium-phosphorus product.

AB A method for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) sensing of
   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is reported. Gold nanoparticles
   (AuNPs) decorated hydrophobic porous glycidyl methacrylate-ethylene
   dimethacrylate (GMA-EDMA) polymer is developed as the SERS substrate.
   GMA-EDMA material with porosity and permeability shows rapid and
   efficient adsorption of PAHs through presumed hydrophobic interaction,
   which brings the analytes close to the substrate. Meanwhile, the three
   dimensional porous morphology might benefit AuNPs distribution for high
   SERS enhancement. Studies on the effects of AuNPs surface coverage on
   the substrate and time of PAHs-substrate interaction are presented. The
   qualitative analysis and quantitative tendency of this method for PAHs
   detection are investigated with anthracene, phenanthrene and pyrene as
   probe molecules, showing that the characteristic fingerprint vibrational
   peaks of each PAH can be readily identified, and the limit of detections
   are 0.93 x 10(-7), 4.5 x 10(-7) and 1.1 x 10(-7) M respectively.
   Moreover, the substrate exhibits high reproducibility with the relative
   standard deviation about 16% in spot and spot SERS intensity. Using this
   method for rapid screening of PAHs mixture in some water samples are
   performed well, which might be useful for environmental pollutions
   monitoring. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The potential role of vitamin D in cancer prevention has generated
   substantial interest, and laboratory experiments indicate several
   anti-cancer properties for vitamin D compounds. Prospective studies of
   circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], the accepted biomarker of
   vitamin D status, suggest an inverse association with colorectal cancer
   risk, but with some inconsistencies. Furthermore, the direct or indirect
   impact of the key transport protein, vitamin D binding protein (DBP),
   has not been examined. We conducted a prospective study of serum 25(OH)D
   and DBP concentrations and colorectal cancer risk in the Prostate, Lung,
   Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, based on 476 colorectal
   cancer cases and 476 controls, matched on age, sex, race and date of
   serum collection. All subjects underwent sigmoidoscopic screening at
   baseline and once during follow-up. Conditional logistic regression
   estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
   Circulating 25(OH)D was inversely associated with colorectal cancer
   (OR=0.60, 95% CI 0.38-0.94 for highest versus lowest quintile, p trend
   0.01). Adjusting for recognized colorectal cancer risk factors and
   accounting for seasonal vitamin D variation did not alter the findings.
   Neither circulating DBP nor the 25(OH)D:DBP molar ratio, a proxy for
   free circulating 25(OH)D, was associated with risk (OR=0.82, 95% CI
   0.54-1.26, and OR=0.79, 95% CI 0.52-1.21, respectively), and DBP did not
   modify the 25(OH)D association. The current study eliminated confounding
   by colorectal cancer screening behavior, and supports an association
   between higher vitamin D status and substantially lower colorectal
   cancer risk, but does not indicate a direct or modifying role for DBP.
   What's new? Vitamin D possesses anticancer properties, such as an
   ability to inhibit cell proliferation and angiogenesis and to promote
   cell differentiation and apoptosis. In particular, vitamin D status may
   be inversely linked with colorectal cancer risk, though studies have
   yielded inconsistent results. The present investigation suggests that
   increased levels of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D), a
   biomarker for vitamin D status, are associated with a substantially
   reduced risk of colorectal cancer. No association or modifying role was
   detected for circulating levels of vitamin D binding protein, the
   primary carrier of 25(OH)D.

AB In this work, we report a simple strategy for signal amplification using
   appropriately functionalized gold nanoparticles in an electrochemical
   genosensor which led to attomolar detection of breast cancer 1 (BRCA1)
   gene. The sensor was developed by the layer-by-layer assembly of
   mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), polyethylene glycol (PEG) functionalized
   gold nanoparticle (AuNPPEG), capture DNA (DNA-c), target BRCA1 DNA
   (DNA-t) and gold nanoparticle labeled reporter DNA (DNA-r.AuNP) on gold
   electrode. PEG functionalized gold nanoparticles on the MPA surface
   provided good electron conducting path nullifying the insulating effect
   of MPA and also act as a proper immobilization platform for the DNA-c by
   the large number of carboxyl groups present on the functionalized gold
   nanoparticles. We demonstrated that the incorporation of MPA
   functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPMPA) as an electrochemical label
   in this sensor design could significantly enhance the sensitivity in the
   detection. The DNA hybridization of DNA-r.AuNP with target probe was
   measured by chronoamperometry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
   (EIS), and scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS). Electrochemical
   quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) experiments were used to support the
   detection and also to calculate the number of adsorbed molecules on the
   surface. Under optimum conditions the present sensor exhibited high
   sensitivity and a very low detection limit of 50 attomolar DNA target
   (294.8 attogram BRCA1 gene/ml). It shows excellent selectivity against
   non complementary sequences and 3 base mismatch complementary targets.
   It also shows good reproducibility, stability and reusability and the
   developed sensor surface is suitable for point-of care applications. (C)

AB AIM: To evaluate the association between liver stiffness (LS) prior to
   the initiation of dual/triple therapy and viral response.
   METHODS: LS was measured in all patients before treatment was
   administered. The therapeutic approach was based on hepatic,
   virological, and immunological evaluations and considered the fact that
   patients with severe fibrosis (F3) or compensated cirrhosis (F4) in
   Child-Pugh class A are the primary candidates for triple therapy. In
   total, 65 hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients were treated with
   Peg-interferon/ribavirin (Peg-IFN/RBV); 24 patients were classified as
   genotypes 1/4 (36.92%), and 41 patients were classified as genotypes 2/3
   (63.08%) (dual therapy). In addition, 20 HCV treatment-experienced
   genotype 1 patients were treated with PegIFN-RBV and boceprevir (triple
   therapy). Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to compare the groups.
   RESULTS: LS significantly differed between dual therapy and triple
   therapy (P = 0.002). The mean LS value before dual therapy treatment was
   8.61 +/- 5.79 kPa and was significantly different between patients
   achieving a sustained virologic response (SVR) 24 weeks after therapy
   and those who did not (7.23 +/- 5.18 kPa vs 11.72 +/- 5.99 kPa,
   respectively, P = 0.0003). The relative risk of non-response to therapy
   was 4.45 (95% CI: 2.32-8.55). The attributable risk of non-response to
   therapy was 49%. The mean LS value before triple therapy treatment was
   13.29 +/-8.57 kPa and was significantly different between patients
   achieving and not achieving SVR24 (9.41 +/-5.05 vs 19.11 +/-9.74,
   respectively; P = 0.008). The relative risk of non-response to therapy
   was 5.57% (95% CI: 1.50-20.65). The attributable risk of non-response to
   therapy (70%) was increased compared with dual therapy patients.
   Pre-treatment stiffness > 12 kPa was significantly associated with
   non-SVR (P < 0.025) in both groups.
   CONCLUSION: Pre-treatment liver stiffness may be useful for predicting
   the response to treatment in patients treated with either dual or triple
   anti-HCV therapy.

AB A convenient, rapid, sensitive and environmentally friendly method for
   simultaneous monitoring of six estrogen mimics (bisphenol A,
   diethylstilbestrol, dienestrol, hexestrol, octylphenol and nonylphenol)
   in water and milk samples was developed by coupling multiple monolithic
   fiber solid-phase microextraction (MMF-SPME) to high performance liquid
   chromatography with diode array detection. The MMF-SPME based on
   polymeric ionic liquid-based monolith as extractive medium was used to
   concentrate target analytes. Because there were multiple interactions
   between adsorbent and analytes, the MMF-SPME exhibited a high extractive
   capability toward analytes. To obtain optimum extraction performance,
   several extraction parameters including desorption solvent, pH value and
   ionic strength in sample matrix, extraction and desorption time were
   investigated and discussed. Under the optimized extraction conditions,
   the limits of detection (S/N =3) of the proposed method were 0.040-0.11
   mu g/L in water and in milk samples. Satisfactory linearity was achieved
   for analytes with the correlation coefficients (r) above 0.99. Excellent
   method reproducibility was achieved by evaluating the repeatability,
   intermediate precision and MMF-to-MMF reproducibility with relative
   standard deviations (RSDs) of both less than 10%. Finally, the proposed
   method was successfully applied to the determination of estrogen mimics
   in several milk and environmental water samples. Recoveries obtained for
   the determination of six target analytes in spiking samples ranged from
   75.6% to 118%, with RSD below 10% in all cases. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

   VMNPs in the polymerization mixture was investigated at several VMNP
   contents. Using short UV-polymerization times, polymeric beds with
   homogenously dispersed VMNPs were obtained. The novel stationary phases
   were characterized by scanning electron microscopy. The chromatographic
   performance of these hybrid monoliths was evaluated using alkyl benzenes
   and organophosphorous pesticides as test solutes. Using capillary
   electrochromatography, efficiencies up to 130,000 plates/m were
   achieved. The increase of the specific surface area of hybrid monoliths
   led to an increase in the retention of all the test analytes, and an
   enhancement of efficiency. The resulting hybrid monolithic columns

AB A fundamental problem in neurophysiology is the understanding of
   neuronal mechanisms by which the central nervous system produces a
   sequence of voluntary or involuntary motor acts from a diverse repertory
   of movements. These kinds of transitions between motor acts are
   extremely complex; however, they could be analyzed in a more simple form
   in decerebrate animals in the context of spinal central pattern
   generation. Here, we present for the first time a physiological
   phenomenon of post-scratching locomotion in which decerebrate cats
   exhibit a compulsory locomotor activity after an episode of scratching.
   We found flexor, extensor and intermediate single interneurons
   rhythmically firing in the same phase during both scratching and the
   subsequent post-scratching locomotion. Because no changes in phase of
   these neurons from scratching to post-scratching locomotion were found,
   we suggest that in the lumbar spinal cord there are neurons associated
   with both motor tasks. Moreover, because of its high reproducibility we
   suggest that the study of post-scratching fictive locomotion, together
   with the unitary recording of neurons, could become a useful tool to
   study neuronal mechanisms underlying transitions from one rhythmic motor
   task to another, and to study in more detail the central pattern
   generator circuitry in the spinal cord. (C) 2015 IBRO. Published by

AB A novel optosensing chip was constructed by anchoring the fluorescence
   sensing material layer based on molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP)
   coated CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) on a chip for highly selective and
   sensitive optosensing of sesamol in sesame oil. Many factors that
   affected the performance of the optosensing chip based on MIP-coated QDs
   are discussed. Under optimized conditions, the relative fluorescence
   intensity of the optosensing chip decreased linearly (r(2) > 0.99) with
   increasing sesamol concentration in the range from 2.4 x 10(-6) to 1.2 x
   10(-3) mol L-1 with a detection limit of 7.2 x 10(-8) mol L-1. The
   relative standard deviation for five replicate detections of 4.8 x 10-4
   mol L-1 sesamol was 2.2%. Recoveries of 94.8-102.3% were achieved by
   direct detection when the optosensing chip was used for the selective
   detection of sesamol in sesame oil. Practically, the optosensing
   approach showed high sensitivity, good selectivity, and excellent
   reproducibility for the detection of sesamol in real oil samples.

AB We report a new paper-based surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)
   substrate platform contributed by a poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA)
   nanofibrous paper adsorbed with plasmonic nanostructures, which can
   circumvent many challenges of the existing SERS substrates. This PLLA
   nanofibrous paper has three-dimensional porous structure, extremely
   clean surface with good hydrophobicity (contact angle is as high as
   133.4 degrees), and negligible background interference under Raman laser
   excitation. Due to the strong electrostatic interaction between PLLA
   nanofiber and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) molecules, the
   CTAB-coated gold nanorods (GNRs) are efficiently immobilized onto the
   fibers. Such a hydrophobic paper substrate with locally hydrophilic
   SERS-active area can confine analyte molecules and prevent the random
   spreading of molecules. The confinement leads to focusing effect and the
   GNRs-PLLA SERS substrate is found to be highly sensitive (0.1 nM
   Rhodamine 6G and malachite green) and exhibit excellent reproducibility
   (similar to 8% relative standard deviation (RSD)) and long-term
   stability. Furthermore, it is also cost-efficient, with simple
   fabrication methodology, and demonstrates high sample collection
   efficiency. All of these benefits ensure that this GNRs-PLLA substrate
   is a really perfect choice for a variety of SERS applications.

AB A major challenge in the study of mycobacterial RNA biology is the lack
   of a comprehensive RNA isolation method that overcomes the unusual cell
   wall to faithfully yield the full spectrum of non-coding RNA (ncRNA)
   species. Here, we describe a simple and robust procedure optimized for
   the isolation of total ncRNA, including 5S, 16S and 23S ribosomal RNA
   (rRNA) and tRNA, from mycobacteria, using Mycobacterium bovis BCG to
   illustrate the method. Based on a combination of mechanical disruption
   and liquid and solid-phase technologies, the method produces all major
   species of ncRNA in high yield and with high integrity, enabling direct
   chemical and sequence analysis of the ncRNA species. The reproducibility
   of the method with BCG was evident in bioanalyzer electrophoretic
   analysis of isolated RNA, which revealed quantitatively significant
   differences in the ncRNA profiles of exponentially growing and
   non-replicating hypoxic bacilli. The method also overcame an historical
   inconsistency in 5S rRNA isolation, with direct sequencing revealing a
   novel post-transcriptional processing of 5S rRNA to its functional form
   and with chemical analysis revealing seven post-transcriptional
   ribonucleoside modifications in the 5S rRNA. This optimized RNA
   isolation procedure thus provides a means to more rigorously explore the
   biology of ncRNA species in mycobacteria.

   The influential morphological parameters and capability of the prepared

   applicability of the synthesized fiber coating was examined by headspace
   solid phase micro extraction and gas chromatography mass spectrometry
   detection of some volatile organic compounds in aqueous samples. Among
   the synthesized nanocomposites and pristine PBT nanofibers, the fiber
   coating with 14% of NiO nanoparticles doping level exhibited the highest
   extraction efficiency. In addition, important parameters influencing the
   extraction/desorption process were investigated and optimized. The
   detection limits were less than 5 ng L-1 using the selected ion
   monitoring mode. The inter-day and intra-day precisions of the developed
   method under optimized conditions were below 11%. The method showed a
   linearity in the range of 10-1000 ng L-1 with the correlation
   coefficient greater than 0.9987. The optimized method was applied to the

AB Practical applications of chemical and biological detections through
   surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) require high reproducibility,

   fabrication. In this work, we integrated a poly-(dimethylsiloxane)
   (PDMS) chip with quasi-3D gold plasmonic nanostructure arrays
   (Q3D-PNAs), which serve as SERS-active substrates, into an optofluidic
   microsystem for online sensitive and reproducible SERS detections. The
   Q3D-PNA PDMS chip was fabricated through soft lithography to ensure both
   precision and low-cost fabrication. The optimal dimension of the Q3D-PNA
   in PDMS was designed using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)
   electromagnetic simulations with a simulated enhancement factor (EF) of
   1.6 x 10(6). The real-time monitoring capability of the SERS-based
   optofluidic microsystem was investigated by kinetic on/ off experiments
   through alternatively flowing Rhodamine 6G (R6G) and ethanol in the
   microfluidic channel. A switch-off time of similar to 2 min at a flow
   rate of 0.3mLmin(-1) was demonstrated. When applied to the detection of
   low concentration malathion, the SERS-based optofluidic microsystem with
   Q3D-PNAs showed high reproducibility, significantly improved efficiency
   and higher detection sensitivity via increasing the flowrate. The
   optofluidic microsystem presented in this paper offers a simple and

   sensing response, it is difficult to build quantitative relationship
   with the intrinsic structure of the material. To break through this
   difficulty, resonant cantilever is employed as gravimetric tool to
   implement molecule adsorption experiment. Based on the sensing data, key
   kinetic/thermodynamic parameters of the material to the molecule,
   including adsorption heat -Delta H degrees, adsorption/desorption rate
   constants K-a and K-d, active-site number per unit mass N' and surface
   coverage theta, can be quantitatively extracted according to
   physical-chemistry theories. With gaseous DMMP simulant of
   organophosphorus agents) as sensing target, the optimization route for
   three sensing materials is successfully demonstrated. Firstly, a
   hyper-branched polymer is evaluated. Though suffering low sensitivity
   due to insufficient N', the bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-hexafluoropropane
   (BHPF) sensing-group exhibits satisfactory reproducibility due to
   appropriate -Delta H degrees. To achieve more sensing-sites, KIT-5
   mesoporous-silica with higher surface-area is assessed, resulting in
   good sensitivity but too high -Delta H degrees that brings poor
   repeatability. After comprehensive consideration, the confirmed BHPF
   sensing-group is grafted on the KIT-5 carrier to form an optimized DMMP
   sensing nanomaterial. Experimental results indicate that, featuring
   appropriate kinetic/thermodynamic parameters of -Delta H degrees, K-a,
   K-d, N' and theta, the BHPF-functionalized KIT-5 mesoporous silica
   exhibits synergistic improvement among reproducibility, sensitivity and
   response/recovery speed. The optimized material shows complete signal
   recovery, 55% sensitivity improvement than the hyper-branched polymer
   and 2 similar to 3 folds faster response/recovery speed than the KIT-5
   mesoporous silica. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

EP 69
PD MAR 10 2015
PY 2015
AB A new method for the determination of seawater Pb isotope compositions
   and concentrations was developed, which combines and optimizes
   previously published protocols for the separation and isotopic analysis
   of this element. For isotopic analysis, the procedure involves initial
   separation of Pb from 1 to 2 L of seawater by co-precipitation with Mg
   hydroxide and further purification by a two stage anion exchange
   procedure. The Pb isotope measurements are subsequently carried out by
   thermal ionization mass spectrometry using a Pb-207-Pb-204 double spike
   for correction of instrumental mass fractionation. These methods are
   associated with a total procedural Pb blank of 28 +/- 21 pg(1sd) and
   typical Pb recoveries of 40-60%. The Pb concentrations are determined by
   isotope dilution (ID) on 50 mL of seawater, using a simplified version
   of above methods. Analyses of multiple aliquots of six seawater samples
   yield a reproducibility of about +/- 1to +/- 10%(1sd) for Pb
   concentrations of between 7 and 50 pmol/kg, where precision was
   primarily limited by the uncertainty of the blank correction (12 +/- 4
   pg; 1sd). For the Pb isotope analyses, typical reproducibilities (+/-
   2sd) of 700-1500 ppm and 1000-2000ppm were achieved for Pb-207/Pb-206,
   Pb-208/Pb-206 and Pb-206/Pb-204, Pb-207/Pb-204, Pb-208/Pb-204,
   respectively. These results are superior to literature data that were
   obtained using plasma source mass spectrometry and they are at least a
   factor of five more precise for ratios involving the minor Pb-204
   isotope. Both Pb concentration and isotope data, furthermore, show good
   agreement with published results for two seawater intercomparison
   samples of the GEOTRACES program. Finally, the new methods were applied
   to a seawater depth profile from the eastern South Atlantic. Both Pb
   contents and isotope compositions display a smooth evolution with depth,
   and no obvious outliers. Compared to previous Pb isotope data for
   seawater, the Pb-206/Pb-204 ratios are well correlated with
   Pb-207/Pb-206, underlining the significant improvement achieved in the
   measurement of the minor Pb-204 isotope. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published

   coefficient of 0.9974 to cisplatin at concentrations between 1.45 x

   10(3)) mu A L mol(-1), and detection and quantification limits of 4.6 x
   10(-6) and 1.4 x 10(-5) mol L-1, respectively. The reproducibility of
   the sensor response evaluated by the analysis of three replicates,
   indicated a RSD of 3.91%. The excellent response of the
   MWCNT-COOH/SDS/SPCEs cisplatin sensor allowed it to be tested in samples
   of human blood serum whose levels of added cisplatin were monitored by
   the HPLC. The average error % (sensor/HPLC) of 3.4 indicates that the
   combined methodology of MWCNT-COOH modified SPCE and the addition of a
   surfactant such as dodecyl sulfate is a convenient alternative for the
   use of HPLC for cisplatin determination in biological samples. The
   methodology cannot be applied to non-ionizable antitumor drugs

AB Two-dimensional (2D) correlation analysis is a well-established tool in
   spectroscopy. Despite its versatility in various measurement systems, 2D
   correlation has not yet become popular in separation science. 2D
   correlation is seldom used in chromatography; only a few a studies can
   be found on this topic and most of those publications report about gel
   chromatography. In the present study, 2D correlation analysis is applied
   to chromatograms. In this study, a simple method is built for studying
   the similarities and dissimilarities between a number of chromatograms.
   We present the applicability of the method by two examples, where the
   repeatability and reproducibility of the analytical and nonlinear
   measurements in HPLC are evaluated and demonstrated. In order to
   validate the results of 2D correlation analysis, they are compared to
   principal component analysis (PCA). We confirm the equivalence in the
   interpretation of the results obtained with the two methods of
   calculation. The results confirm that 2D correlation can be a successful
   chemometric tool in chromatography. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB The development of an appropriate extraction method for untargeted
   environmental metabolomic analysis of marine polychaetes could promote
   their use for environmental monitoring purposes. To this end, we
   compared four extraction methods on the marine polychaete Nereis virens
   both exposed to crude oil and non-exposed. XCMS was used for feature
   detection and preprocessing; different normalization and scaling
   approaches were tested; and principal component analysis (PCA) was used
   together with basic statistical tests to ascertain common metabolic
   patterns and determine the most suitable extraction method. We conclude
   that a two-step extraction procedure with 80:20 (v/v) methanol:water on
   freeze dried polychaete tissue provides the best trade-off between
   analysis time, and extraction efficiency and intermediate
   reproducibility. No definitive conclusions could be drawn about the
   ability of the method to discriminate controls and crude oils in actual
   biological replicates because the experiment was carried out by design
   on analytical replicates only. We show that the normalization to the sum
   of all the common features, and the use of a weighted least squares
   criterion to fit the PCA by means of scaling to the median absolute
   deviation (MAD) of the pooled quality control samples significantly

AB Background and Purpose
   Imaging the optic radiation (OR) is of considerable interest in studying
   diseases affecting the visual pathway and for pre-surgical planning of
   temporal lobe resections. The purpose of this study was to investigate
   the clinical feasibility of using probabilistic diffusion tractography
   based on constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) to image the optic
   radiation. It was hypothesized that CSD would provide improved tracking
   of the OR compared with the widely used ball-and-stick model.
   Methods
   Diffusion weighted MRI (30 directions) was performed on twenty patients
   with no known visual deficits. Tractography was performed using
   probabilistic algorithms based on fiber orientation distribution models
   of local white matter trajectories. The performance of these algorithms
   was evaluated by comparing computational times and receiver operating
   characteristic results, and by correlation of anatomical landmark
   distances to dissection estimates.
   Results
   The results showed that it was consistently feasible to reconstruct
   individual optic radiations from clinically practical (4.5 minute
   acquisition) diffusion weighted imaging data sets using CSD.
   Tractography based on the CSD model resulted in significantly shorter
   computational times, improved receiver operating characteristic results,
   and shorter Meyer's loop to temporal pole distances (in closer agreement
   with dissection studies) when compared to the ball-and-stick based
   algorithm.
   Conclusions
   Accurate tractography of the optic radiation can be accomplished using
   diffusion MRI data collected within a clinically practical timeframe.
   CSD based tractography was faster, more accurate and had better
   correlation with known anatomical landmarks than ball-and-stick
   tractography.

AB Poor reproducibility limits the wide uptake of low-cost surface enhanced
   Raman spectroscopy (SERS) substrates. This study reports a relatively
   low-cost and reproducible cellulose nanofibre (CNF) textured SERS
   substrate. Utilizing a layer of CNFs deposited onto glass slides,
   nanoscale roughness was achieved, which facilitated effective
   aggregation of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to form a novel CNF textured
   SERS substrate. This substrate meets the critical roughness requirements
   to control the distribution of AuNPs to provide 'hot spots' for SERS
   detection, offering significant signal enhancement. The reproducibility
   and accuracy of low-cost cellulosic SERS substrates were significantly
   improved on a model SERS molecule of 4-aminothiophenol. (C) 2015

AB This paper presents the synthesis of undoped and 2 wt.% titanium (Ti)
   doped zinc oxide (ZnO) thin films onto glass substrates by chemical
   spray pyrolysis technique. Both films are deposited at 375 degrees C
   substrate temperature. The influence of Ti doping on structural,
   morphological, optical and UV detection properties of ZnO film was
   studied. Both films revealed to be of polycrystalline nature with a
   hexagonal wurtzite structure; and the ZnO film crystallinity improved on
   Ti doping. Surface morphological observations agreed well with
   structural results. The Ti incorporation in ZnO thin films were
   confirmed by an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopic analysis (EDX).
   The Ti doping increased the optical transmittance (similar to 96% at
   550) and band gap (similar to 3.2927 eV) of ZnO thin film. Further, the
   metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) planar ultraviolet photodetectors (UV
   PDs) were fabricated from deposition of tin (Sn) contacts onto undoped
   and Ti doped ZnO films using e-beam evaporation technique. To
   investigate UV photodetection properties, the MSM devices were subjected
   to current-voltage (I-V) characteristics measurements of forward and
   reverse bias in dark and UV light conditions. The photocurrent and
   responsivity were measured as a function of optical power density and
   applied voltage, respectively. The reproducibility of the UV detection
   performance of MSM devices was ensured by constantly switching UV light
   on and off at regular time intervals. The Ti doped ZnO film based UV PD
   demonstrates highest responsivity of about 0.051 A/W upon 2 mW/cm(2)
   illumination at 365 nm peak wavelengths and 5 V applied bias. (C) 2014

AB In this work, we examined the reasons underlying the humidity-induced
   morphological changes of electrospun fibers and suggest a method of
   controlling the electrospun fiber morphology under high humidity
   conditions. We fabricated OPV devices composed of electrospun fibers,
   and the performance of the OPV devices depends significantly on the
   fiber morphology. The evaporation rate of a solvent at various relative
   humidity was measured to investigate the effects of the relative
   humidity during electrospinning process. The beaded nanofiber morphology
   of electrospun fibers was originated due to slow solvent evaporation
   rate under high humidity conditions. To increase the evaporation rate
   under high humidity conditions, warm air was applied to the
   electrospinning system. The beads that would have formed on the
   electrospun fibers were completely avoided, and the power conversion
   efficiencies of OPV devices fabricated under high humidity conditions
   could be restored. These results highlight the simplicity and
   effectiveness of the proposed method for improving the reproducibility
   of electrospun nanofibers and performances of devices consisting of the
   electrospun nanofibers, regardless of the relative humidity.

AB Objective: The Dementia Quality of Life (DQoL) and the Quality of Life
   in Alzheimer's Disease (QoL-AD) are the two most widely used
   dementia-specific QoL instruments in the world. We aimed to compare the
   psychometric properties of these two instruments and identify which is
   most adapted to use in geriatric consultations.
   Methods: To evaluate the psychometric properties of the French language
   validation of DQoL and QoL-AD, 123 patients aged 65years and over
   suffering from AD (Mini Mental State Examination score >= 10) were
   recruited in seven French hospitals and one Switzerland hospital. The
   DQoL comprises 29 items, ranked on a five-point Likert scale and
   measuring five QoL domains: self-esteem, positive affect, negative
   affect, feeling of belonging and sense of aesthetics. The QoL-AD
   contains 13 items giving an overall score ranging from 13 to 52 and
   evaluating the domains of interpersonal relationships, financial
   difficulties, physical condition, memory, mood and overall health.
   Results: Both questionnaires showed adequate reproducibility at 2 weeks
   interval (intra-class correlation coefficient >0.80), good internal
   consistency (Cronbach's alpha coefficient >0.70) and good convergent
   validity with the general health dimension of the Duke Health Profile.
   The time required to complete the QoL-AD was significantly shorter (p <
   0.0001). DQoL had better discriminant capacity (with at least one
   dimension significant for each subgroup of severity of cognitive
   decline, dependency, presence of depression or behavioural disorders).
   Conclusions: For quick evaluation of QoL during consultations in
   geriatric care, the QoL-AD is preferable, whereas for the purposes of
   research and more in-depth evaluation, the DQoL is more suitable.

   ablation-mass spectrometry (AIRLAB-MS) that uses an infrared microscope
   with an infinity-corrected reflective objective and a continuous flow
   solvent probe coupled to a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance
   mass spectrometer is described. The efficiency of material transfer from
   the sample to the electrospray ionization emitter was determined using
   glycerol/methanol droplets containing 1 mM nicotine and is similar to
   50%. This transfer efficiency is significantly higher than values
   reported for similar techniques. Laser desorption does not induce
   fragmentation of biomolecules in droplets containing bradykinin, leucine
   enkephalin and myoglobin, but loss of the heme group from myoglobin
   occurs as a result of the denaturing solution used. An application of
   AIRLAB-MS to biological materials is demonstrated for tobacco leaves.
   Chemical components are identified from the spatially resolved mass
   spectra of the ablated plant material, including nicotine and uridine.
   The reproducibility of measurements made using AIRLAB-MS on plant
   material was demonstrated by the ablation of six closely spaced areas
   (within 2 x 2 mm) on a young tobacco leaf, and the results indicate a
   standard deviation of <10% in the uridine signal obtained for each area.
   The spatial distribution of nicotine was measured for selected leaf
   areas and variation in the relative nicotine levels (15-100%) was
   observed. Comparative analysis of the nicotine distribution was
   demonstrated for two tobacco plant varieties, a genetically modified
   plant and its corresponding wild-type, indicating generally higher
   nicotine levels in the mutant.

   nano-LC/MS for sensitive and detailed profiling of the mouse brain
   glycome. Hundreds of glycan structures were directly detected by
   accurate mass MS and structurally elucidated by MS/MS, revealing the
   presence of novel glycan motifs such as antennary fucosylation,
   sulfation, and glucuronidation that are potentially associated with
   cellular signaling and adhesion. Microgram-level sensitivity enabled
   glycomic analysis of specific regions of the brain, as demonstrated on
   not only brain sections (with a one-dimensional spatial resolution of 20
   mu m) but also isolated brain structures (e.g., the hippocampus).
   Reproducibility was extraordinarily high (R > 0.98) for both method and
   instrumental replicates. The pairing of TGC with structure-specific
   nano-LC/MS was found to be an exceptionally powerful platform for
   qualitative and quantitative exploration of the brain glycome.

AB A new, novel, rapid method to detect and direct readout of drugs in
   human urine has been developed using dynamic surface-enhanced Raman
   spectroscopy (D-SERS) with portable Raman spectrometer on gold nanorods
   (GNRs) and a classification algorithm called support vector machines
   (SVM). The high-performance GNRs can generate gigantic enhancement and
   the SERS signals obtained using D-SERS on it have high reproducibility.
   On the basis of this feature of D-SERS, we have obtained SERS spectra of
   urine and urine containing methamphetamine (MAMP). SVM model was built
   using these data for fast identified and visual results. This general
   method was successfully applied to the detection of 3, 4-methylenedioxy
   methamphetamine (MDMA) in human urine. To verify the accuracy of the
   model, drug addicts urine containing MAMP were detected and identified
   correctly and rapidly with accuracy more than 90%. The detection results
   were displayed directly without analysis of their SERS spectra manually.
   Compared with the conventional method in lab, the method only needs a 2
   mu L sample volume and takes no more than 2 min on the portable Raman
   spectrometer. It is anticipated that this method will enable rapid,
   convenient detection of drugs on site for the police.

   A novel LIF optical system with high collection efficiency was
   constructed by using a parabolic mirror. Carboxyl-functionalized
   magnetic beads were used to immobilize antibody for achieving a
   conventional sandwich assay. Fluorescence from Rhodamine 6G
   (R6G)-labeled antibody was collected by the newly designed optical
   system. To reduce photobleaching of R6G under laser irradiation, ethanol
   instead of commonly used aqueous solution was used as assay buffer in
   the last stage. The newly developed LIF immunoassay displayed excellent
   analytical performance for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) detection in the
   concentration range from 0.005 to 1.0 ng/mL with a detection limit of
   0.0016 ng/mL. The detection limit obtained in this work is about 3
   orders of magnitude better than that of conventional enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In addition, the proposed method exhibited
   excellent precision, acceptable stability, and good reproducibility.
   Furthermore, the proposed immunoassay was successfully applied to AFP
   determination in real serum specimens. Therefore, the present

   age of 2.55 years and mean disease duration of 12.48 days. The most
   common initial diagnoses were intestinal obstruction and peritonitis.
   Real-time ultrasound imaging with multislice views revealed
   characteristics of choledochal cyst perforation, including changes in
   the shape of the bile duct, loss of local gallbladder tension, thickened
   gallbladder wall, changes in the morphology of the gallbladder, and
   peritoneal effusion. The inability to visualize the gallbladder,
   gallbladder enlargement, the presence of gallbladder sludge and of
   pebblelike stones, and dilatation of the intrahepatic ducts were also
   noted on ultrasound. Choledochectasia was present in a majority of the
   patients (17/23), and ascites was seen in all 23 patients. The
   ultrasound signs corresponded to the surgical findings, thus showing the
   high clinical diagnostic value of ultrasound in this setting.
   CONCLUSION. Real-time ultrasound imaging-with its multislice views and
   good reproducibility- allows definitive preoperative diagnosis of
   pediatric choledochal cyst perforation.

AB Objective: This prospective study assesses volume changes of the
   Achilles tendon in case of chronic tendinopathy (TEN), using an
   automated contour detection algorithm in submillimeter isotropic
   3-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging data sets, recorded at 3 T.
   Methods: Forty-one subjects (median age, 40 years; range, 19-68 years)
   were included in this prospective study and underwent nonenhanced
   magnetic resonance imaging of both Achilles tendons at 3 T, deploying a
   T2-weighted 3-dimensional Fast-Spin-Echo sequence with submillimeter
   resolution of 0.8mm. Of the 41 subjects, 13 were classified as patients
   with TEN and 28 were healthy volunteers and served as control group. Of
   the 13 patients, 10 had unilateral TEN and 3 had bilateral TEN. Achilles
   tendons were automatically segmented in the T2-weighted magnetic
   resonance data sets for the evaluation of the tendon volume (0-3 cm
   proximal to the cranial border of the calcaneal bone). The total volume
   (length, 3 cm) was divided in 3 subvolumes of 1 cm length, named volume
   (0-1 cm), volume (12 cm), and volume (2-3 cm). Minimum and maximum
   tendon cross-sectional area within the total volume was processed. A
   standardized pain questionnaire was obtained from all patients.
   Results: The automated contour detection algorithm worked reliably in
   all cases. The TEN group showed a significantly increased tendon volume
   compared to the control group (mean volume, 2.94 vs 2.43 mm(3); P <
   0.05). The difference was most obvious concerning volume (2-3 cm) (P <
   0.0001). Evaluation of clinical severity revealed a moderate correlation
   between VISA-score and tendon volume (2-3 cm) as well as the
   maximum/minimum tendon area (rho = -0.44, rho = -0.48, and rho = -0.41).
   In case of unilateral TEN, the symptomatic side showed an increased
   tendon volume (2-3 cm) and increased minimum area (P < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Tendon volume and size are adequate surrogate parameters to
   differentiate patients with chronic TEN from healthy subjects, and may
   discriminate symptomatic TEN from asymptomatic "silent" TEN in patients
   with unilateral symptoms.

AB Previously, we reported that the matrix-assisted laser desorption
   ionization spectrum of a peptide became reproducible when an effective
   temperature was held constant. Using a calibration curve drawn by
   plotting the peptide-to-matrix ion abundance ratio versus the peptide
   concentration in a solid sample, a peptide could be quantified without
   the use of any internal standard. In this work, we quantified proteins
   by quantifying their tryptic peptides with the aforementioned method. We
   modified the digestion process; e.g. disulfide bonds were not cleaved,
   so that hardly any reagent other than trypsin remained after the
   digestion process. This allowed the preparation of a sample by the
   direct mixing of a digestion mixture with a matrix solution. We also
   observed that the efficiency of the matrix-to-peptide proton transfer,
   as measured by its reaction quotient, was similar for peptides with
   arginine at the C-terminus. With the reaction quotient averaged over
   many such peptides, we could rapidly quantify proteins. Most
   importantly, no peptide standard, not to mention its isotopically
   labeled analog, was needed in this method. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley

AB To realize portable systems for routine measurements in point-of-care
   settings, MCE methods are required to be robust across many single-use
   chips. While it is well-known internal standards (ISTDs) improve
   run-to-run precision, a systematic investigation is necessary to
   determine the significance of chip-to-chip imprecision in MCE and how
   ISTDs account for it. This paper addresses this question by exploring
   the reproducibility of Na quantification across six basic, in-house
   fabricated microchips. A dataset of 900 electrophoerograms was collected
   from analyzing five concentrations of NaCl with two ISTDs (CsCl and
   LiCl). While both improved the peak area reproducibility, the Na/Cs
   ratio was superior to the Na/Li ratio (improving the RSD by a factor of
   2-4, depending on the Na concentration). Weattribute this to the
   significant variation inmicrochannel surface properties, which was
   accounted for by cesium but not lithium. Microchip dimension and
   detector variations were only a few percent, and could be improved
   through commercial fabrication over in-house made microchips. These
   results demonstrate that ISTDs not only correct for intrachip
   imprecision, but are also a viable means to correct for chip-to-chip
   imprecision inherent in disposable, point-of-care MCE devices. However,
   as expected, the internal standard must be carefully chosen.

   fragments of the amyloid beta-protein (A beta) (A beta(1-15) and A beta
   (10-20) peptides) by on-line immobilized metal affinity SPE-CE
   (IMA-SPE-CE). The performance of a nickel metal ion (Ni(II)) sorbent
   based on nitrilotriacetic acid as a chelating agent was significantly
   better than two coppermetal ion (Cu(II)) sorbents based on iminodiacetic
   acid. A BGE of 25mMphosphate (pH 7.4) and an eluent of 50mM imidazole
   (in BGE) yielded a 25-fold and 5-fold decrease in the LODs by
   IMA-SPE-CE-UV for A beta (1-15) and A beta(10-20) peptides (0.1 and 0.5
   mu g/mL, respectively) with regard to CE-UV (2.5 mu g/mL for both
   peptides). The phosphate BGE was also used in IMA-SPE-CEMS, but the
   eluent needed to be substituted by a 0.5% HAc v/v solution. Under
   optimum preconcentration and detection conditions, reproducibility of
   peak areas and migration times was acceptable (23.2 and 12.0% RSD,
   respectively). The method was more sensitive for A beta (10-20) peptide,
   which could be detected until 0.25 mu g/mL. Linearity for A beta (10-20)
   peptide was good in a narrow concentration range (0.25-2.5 mu g/mL, R-2
   = 0.93). Lastly, the potential of the optimized Ni(II)-IMA-SPE-CE-MS
   method for the analysis of amyloid peptides in biological fluids was
   evaluated by analyzing spiked plasma and serum samples.

AB Background: Liquid-based cytology (LBC) for cervical screening would
   benefit from laboratory practice guidelines that define specimen
   adequacy for reporting of slides. The evidence base required to define
   cell adequacy should incorporate both ThinPrep(TM) (TP; Hologic, Inc.,
   Bedford, MA, USA) and SurePath(TM) (SP; BD Diagnostics, Burlington, NC,
   USA), the two LBC systems used in the UK cervical screening programmes.
   Objectives: The objectives of this study were to determine (1) current
   practice for reporting LBC in England, Wales and Scotland, (2) a
   reproducible method for cell counting, (3) the cellularity of slides
   classified as inadequate, negative or abnormal and (4) the impact of
   varying cellularity on the likelihood of detecting cytological
   abnormalities.
   Design: The study involved four separate arms to pursue each of the four
   objectives. (1) A questionnaire survey of laboratories was conducted.
   (2) A standard counting protocol was developed and used by three
   experienced cytopathologists to determine a reliable and reproducible
   cell counting method. (3) Slide sets which included a range of
   cytological abnormalities were each sent to three laboratories for cell
   counting to study the correlation between cell counts and reported
   cytological outcomes. (4) Dilution of LBC samples by fluid only
   (unmixed) or by dilution with a sample containing normal cells (mixed)
   was performed to study the impact on reporting of reducing either the
   total cell count or the relative proportion of abnormal to normal cells.
   Setting: The study was conducted within the cervical screening
   programmes in England, Wales and Scotland, using routinely obtained
   cervical screening samples, and in 56 participating NHS cervical
   cytology laboratories.
   Participants: The study involved only routinely obtained cervical
   screening samples.
   Interventions: There was no clinical intervention.
   Main outcome measures: The main outcome measures were (1) reliability of
   counting method, (2) correlation of reported cytology grades with
   cellularity and (3) levels of detection of abnormal cells in
   progressively diluted cervical samples.
   Results: Laboratory practice varied in terms of threshold of cellular
   adequacy and of morphological markers of adequacy. While SP laboratories
   generally used a minimum acceptable cell count (MACC) of 15,000, the
   MACC employed by TP laboratories varied between 5000 and 15,000. The
   cell counting study showed that a standard protocol achieved moderate to
   strong inter-rater reproducibility. Analysis of slide reporting from
   laboratories revealed that a large proportion of the samples reported as
   inadequate had cell counts above a threshold of 15,000 for SP, and 5000
   and 10,000 for TP. Inter-rater unanimity was greater among more cellular
   preparations. Dilution studies demonstrated greater detection of
   abnormalities in slides with counts above the MACC and among slides with
   more than 25 dyskaryotic cells.
   Conclusions: Variation in laboratory practice demonstrates a requirement
   for evidence-based standards for designating a MACC. This study has
   indicated that a MACC of 15,000 and 5000 for SP and TP, respectively,
   achieves a balance in terms of maintaining sensitivity and low
   inadequacy rates.
   Future work: The findings of this study should inform the development of
   laboratory practice guidelines.

AB Objectives: It is widely acknowledged that the performance of diagnostic
   and prognostic prediction models should be assessed in external
   validation studies with independent data from "different but related"
   samples as compared with that of the development sample. We developed a
   framework of methodological steps and statistical methods for analyzing
   and enhancing the interpretation of results from external validation
   studies of prediction models.
   Study Design and Setting: We propose to quantify the degree of
   relatedness between development and validation samples on a scale
   ranging from reproducibility to transportability by evaluating their
   corresponding case-mix differences. We subsequently assess the models'
   performance in the validation sample and interpret the performance in
   view of the case-mix differences. Finally, we may adjust the model to
   the validation setting.
   Results: We illustrate this three-step framework with a prediction model
   for diagnosing deep venous thrombosis using three validation samples
   with varying case mix. While one external validation sample merely
   assessed the model's reproducibility, two other samples rather assessed
   model transportability. The performance in all validation samples was
   adequate, and the model did not require extensive updating to correct
   for miscalibration or poor fit to the validation settings.
   Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances the interpretation of
   findings at external validation of prediction models. (C) 2015 The

   methods of separation based on alkali extraction and melting wax in

AB Objectives Our aim was to develop a partial volume (PV) correction
   method of choline (Cho) signals detected by breast 3D-magnetic resonance
   spectroscopic imaging (3D-MRSI), using information from water/fat-Dixon
   MRI.
   Methods Following institutional review board approval, five breast
   cancer patients were measured at 3 T. 3D-MRSI (1 cm(3) resolution,
   duration similar to 11 min) and Dixon MRI (1 mm(3), similar to 2 min)
   were measured in vivo and in phantoms. Glandular/lesion tissue was
   segmented from water/fat-Dixon MRI and transformed to match the
   resolution of 3D-MRSI. The resulting PV values were used to correct Cho
   signals. Our method was validated on a two-compartment phantom
   (choline/water and oil). PV values were correlated with the
   spectroscopic water signal. Cho signal variability, caused by
   partial-water/fat content, was tested in 3D-MRSI voxels located in/near
   malignant lesions.
   Results Phantom measurements showed good correlation (r=0.99) with
   quantified 3D-MRSI water signals, and better homogeneity after
   correction. The dependence of the quantified Cho signal on the water/fat
   voxel composition was significantly (p<0.05) reduced using Dixon
   MRI-based PV correction, compared to the original uncorrected data
   (1.60-fold to 3.12-fold) in patients.
   Conclusions The proposed method allows quantification of the Cho signal
   in glandular/lesion tissue independent of water/fat composition in
   breast 3D-MRSI. This can improve the reproducibility of breast 3D-MRSI,
   particularly important for therapy monitoring.

   loading with minimal excipients. This study focuses on the development
   of a pharmaceutically acceptable nanomatrix system for parenteral
   delivery based on Hydroxyethyl Starch (HES), a FDA approved polymer that
   is relatively unexplored in drug delivery research. HES nanoparticles
   were prepared through a simple, two-step crosslinking-precipitation
   route, yielding 160 +/- 5 nm, nearly monodispersed spherical particles
   with high colloidal stability. The utility of this nanocarrier for
   parenteral delivery was verified by a panel of hemo/cytocompatibility
   assays at high concentrations (0.05-1 mg/ml) in vitro and in vivo. HES
   nanomatrix was found effective in encapsulating two chemically distinct
   drugs having varying hydrophobicities, with the release behavior being
   influenced by their chemical nature and drug-matrix interactions. Better
   in vitro efficacy was measured for the nanoencapsulated drug than its
   bare form, establishing the potential of HES nanocarriers for controlled

   glaucomatous and fellow normal eyes of unilateral glaucoma
   patients.Methods:In this prospective case-control study, Cirrus HD-OCT
   was performed for 79 unilateral glaucoma patients 3 times on the first
   visit and on 3 subsequent visits within a 2-month period. Test-retest
   standard deviation (TRT-SD) and tolerance limit based on the
   1.645x2xTRT-SD formula were derived for RNFL thicknesses at the
   respective superpixels of the RNFL thickness map.Results:The TRT-SDs and
   tolerance limits of the glaucomatous eyes (TRT-SD: 2.75 to 20.25 m;
   tolerance limits: 6.40 and 47.11 m) were significantly smaller than
   those of the fellow normal eyes (TRT-SD: 2.73 to 26.49 m; tolerance
   limits: 6.35 and 61.63 m) in the superotemporal, inferotemporal, and
   superonasal areas (P <0.05). The TRT-SDs in most areas showed a
   significant positive correlation with the RNFL thicknesses
   (P<0.05).Conclusions:The test-retest variabilities of the Cirrus HD-OCT
   RNFL thickness map of the glaucomatous eyes were lower than those of the
   fellow normal eyes, especially in areas of high diagnostic importance.
   Moreover, variability was positively correlated with the baseline RNFL
   thicknesses. Therefore, adjusting the tolerance limits on the basis of
   the baseline RNFL thickness values might help improve the ability to
   recognize progression. Further prospective studies on this issue are
   warranted.

AB Objective: To validate the usefulness of a diffusional anisotropic
   capillary array phantom and to investigate the effects of diffusion
   tensor imaging (DTI) parameter changes on diffusion fractional
   anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) using the
   phantom.
   Materials and Methods: Diffusion tensor imaging of a capillary array
   phantom was performed with imaging parameter changes, including voxel
   size, number of sensitivity encoding (SENSE) factor, echo time (TE),
   number of signal acquisitions, b-value, and number of diffusion gradient
   directions (NDGD), one-at-a-time in a stepwise-incremental fashion. We
   repeated the entire series of DTI scans thrice. The coefficients of
   variation (CoV) were evaluated for FA and ADC, and the correlation
   between each MR imaging parameter and the corresponding FA and ADC was
   evaluated using Spearman's correlation analysis.
   Results: The capillary array phantom CoVs of FA and ADC were 7.1% and
   2.4%, respectively. There were significant correlations between FA and
   SENSE factor, TE, b-value, and NDGD, as well as significant correlations
   between ADC and SENSE factor, TE, and b-value.
   Conclusion: A capillary array phantom enables repeated measurements of
   FA and ADC. Both FA and ADC can vary when certain parameters are changed
   during diffusion experiments. We suggest that the capillary array
   phantom can be used for quality control in longitudinal or multicenter
   clinical studies.

AB PURPOSE: To characterize clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae by
   phenotypic and genotypic methods.
   MATERIAL/METHODS: Over a 12-month period, 52 isolates of K. pneumoniae
   were isolated. Of these 52 isolates, 7 were isolated over a period of 21
   days from a suspected outbreak in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit
   (NICU) and 45 from sporadic cases occurring in different wards of
   hospital were analysed.
   RESULTS: The prevalence of K. pneumoniae isolates was 4% (52/1295).
   Quinolones, aztreonam and amikacin showed the greatest efficacy showing
   >85% sensitivity. Of the 52 isolates of K. pneumoniae, 8 (15.4%)
   isolates were positive for ESBL-production. Among the ESBL-producing K.
   pneumoniae, two out of 8 (25%) and 6 out of 8 (75%) were positive for
   (bla)SHV and (bla)CTX-M genes respectively. Ribotyping identified 30
   distinct ribogroups among 52 isolates evaluated. Seven NICU outbreak
   isolates were divided into 2 ribotypes, as many as 6 belonged to one
   ribotype while one isolate which was isolated a week later was of a
   different ribotype, indicating the termination of the outbreak in the
   NICU. The outbreak in the NICU thus, was shown to have been caused by a
   single clone.
   CONCLUSIONS: A high discriminatory power, ease of interpretation coupled
   with excellent reproducibility and stability make ribotyping a very
   useful technique for investigating the molecular epidemiology of
   nosocomial infections caused by K. pneumoniae. A regular surveillance of
   hospital associated infections including monitoring antibiotic
   sensitivity pattern of K. pneumoniae, ESBL-production and molecular
   characterization is mandatory to control the spread of
   multidrug-resistant and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae and for
   epidemiological purposes especially in outbreak situations.

PD MAR 2015

AB Pollution-induced community tolerance (PICT) approaches involve
   comparing tolerance levels of natural communities to a particular
   contaminant or a contaminant mixture using short-term toxicity tests
   performed under controlled conditions. However, results from toxicity
   tests can be modulated by various environmental and experimental
   conditions, raising questions about their reproducibility and
   comparability. In this context, the present study aimed to determine the
   influence of exposure duration, periphyton suspension concentration, and
   periphyton maturation stage on the measurement of short-term effects of
   copper on phototrophic periphyton communities. Our results showed the
   very weak influence of exposure duration in the tested range (2-6 h) on
   toxicity level, whereas periphyton biomass in the tested suspension (in
   terms of both chlorophyll a concentrations and dry weight), proved a
   crucial determinant in toxicity assessment. Results also highlighted the
   potential tolerance increase with the periphyton maturation stage. This
   parameter conditioned the positive linear relationship between tolerance
   level and periphyton suspension concentration, leading to an increase in
   the linear regression slope with the maturation stage. This suggests
   that such a relationship is probably highly periphyton-dependent.
   Consequently, to enable data toxicity comparisons, an a priori
   normalization of the periphyton suspension biomass is necessary, and
   PICT approaches require the use, as much of possible, of periphyton with
   similar maturation stage. Finally, the present study clearly shows that
   a better standardization of PICT approaches could help to improve
   reproducibility. It could thus facilitate the comparison of tolerance
   levels measured in the same study (e.g., spatial and/or temporal and/or
   inter-treatment comparison) as well as the comparison obtained from
   different experimental and in situ research.

AB An infrared based positioning and tracking (IPT) system was introduced
   and its accuracy and efficiency for patient setup and monitoring were
   tested for daily radiotherapy treatment. The IPT system consists of a
   pair of floor mounted infrared stereoscopic cameras, passive infrared
   markers and tools used for acquiring localization information as well as
   a custom controlled software which can perform the positioning and
   tracking functions. The evaluation of IPT system characteristics was
   conducted based on the AAPM 147 task report. Experiments on spatial
   drift and reproducibility as well as static and dynamic localization
   accuracy were carried out to test the efficiency of the IPT system.
   Measurements of known translational (up to 55.0 mm) set-up errors in
   three dimensions have been performed on a calibration phantom. The
   accuracy of positioning was evaluated on an anthropomorphic phantom with
   five markers attached to the surface; the precision of the tracking
   ability was investigated through a sinusoidal motion platform. For the
   monitoring of the respiration, three volunteers contributed to the
   breathing testing in real time. The spatial drift of the IPT system was
   0.65 mm within 60 min to be stable. The reproducibility of position
   variations were between 0.01 and 0.04 mm. The standard deviation of
   static marker localization was 0.26 mm. The repositioning accuracy was
   0.19 mm, 0.29 mm, and 0.53 mm in the left/right (L/R), superior/inferior
   (S/I) and anterior/posterior (A/P) directions, respectively. The
   measured dynamic accuracy was 0.57 mm and discrepancies measured for the
   respiratory motion tracking was better than 1 mm. The overall
   positioning accuracy of the IPT system was within 2 mm. In conclusion,
   the IPT system is an accurate and effective tool for assisting patient
   positioning in the treatment room. The characteristics of the IPT system
   can successfully meet the needs for real time external marker tracking
   and patient positioning as well as respiration monitoring during image
   guided radiotherapy treatments. [All rights reserved Elsevier].

AB BACKGROUND: Pixel-based multimodality tissue tracking (MTT) is a new
   noninvasive method for the quantification of cardiac deformation from
   cine image of MRI. The aim of this study is to validate bi-ventricular
   strain measurement by MTT compared to strain-encoding (SENC) MRI and
   harmonic phase (HARP) MRI in pulmonary hypertension (PH) patients.
   METHODS: In 45 subjects (30 PH patients and 15 normal subjects), RV and
   LV peak global longitudinal strains (Ell) were measured from long axis 4
   chamber view using MTT. LV peak global circumferential strains (Ecc) by
   MTT were measured from short axis. For validation, RV and LV Ell by MTT
   were compared to measures by SENC-MRI from short axis, and LV Ecc by MTT
   was compared to measures by short axis tagged MRI analysis (HARP).
   Reproducibility of MTT was also determined.
   RESULTS: MTT quantified RV Ell correlated closely to those of SENC
   (r=0.72, p<0.001), with good limits of agreement. LV Ell quantified by
   MTT showed moderate correlation with SENC (r=0.57, p=0.001), and LV Ecc
   by MTT also showed moderate correlation with HARP (-16.9±4.1 vs
   -14.3±3.5, p<0.001 for all, r=0.60, p<0.001). RV Ell negatively
   correlated with RVEF (r=-0.53, p=0.001) and also positively correlated
   with mean PAP in PH patients (r=0.60, p=0.001). Strain measurement by
   MTT showed high reproducibility.
   CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that MTT is a reproducible tool for
   quantification of cardiac deformation using cine images in PH patients.
   Hence, it could serve as a new rapid and comprehensive technique for
   clinical assessment of regional cardiac function.

AB BACKGROUND: The SYNTAX score helps in the treatment decision in
   multivessel coronary disease. Coronary computed tomography angiography
   (CTA) can measure the SYNTAX score but has been used in few patients
   with multivessel disease. Our aim was to assess the feasibility,
   accuracy and reproducibility of SYNTAX score with CCTA compared with
   invasive coronary angiography (ICA) in de novo left main and/or 3-vessel
   disease.
   METHODS: 57 patients with new left main and/or 3-vessel disease on ICA
   and a CCTA performed within the previous month were included. The SYNTAX
   score was calculated retrospectively for both modalities. Agreement for
   the global score, vessel score, different components and inter-readers
   was evaluated with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The ability
   to classify SYNTAX score categories (low, intermediate and high) was
   assessed using weighted kappa (K) coefficient.
   RESULTS: CCTA-based SYNTAX score showed an acceptable concordance
   (ICC=0.64) and good correlation (r=0.65, p<0.001) with ICA. ICC per
   vessel and component ranged from 0 to 0.73. There was good agreement
   classifying the SYNTAX score categories (K=0.53) and interobserver
   reproducibility (ICC=0.85). CCTA demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy
   (0.84) for detecting patients in the high score group. No patient with a
   high CCTA SYNTAX score had a low risk score by ICA that would suggest
   benefit from percutaneous revascularization.
   CONCLUSIONS: CCTA showed good correlation, acceptable concordance, and
   high reproducibility for the quantification of the SYNTAX score in de
   novo left main and/or 3-vessel coronary disease. A high CCTA SYNTAX
   score identified a group of patients less likely to benefit from
   percutaneous coronary intervention.

AB BackgroundGlypican-3 (GPC3) is an oncofetal antigen that shows great
   promise as a biomarker for diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC),
   but there is no reliable kit that can be used to detect it in clinics.
   The aim of this study is to develop a stable performance kit for GPC3
   detection in clinics.
   Design and methodsThe paired antibodies were identified through
   cycle-screening methods based on our previous research. Then, a double
   antibodies sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay for detecting serum
   GPC3 was developed. The performance of the developed GPC3 diagnostic kit
   was evaluated by detecting the concentration of serum GPC3 and assessing
   its single or combined use with alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and cytokeratin
   19 fragment (CK19) for HCC diagnosis.
   ResultsThe assay demonstrated a linear range of 10-800ng/ml, the
   cross-reactivity rate at 0.018% (AFP), 0.020% (carcino-embryonic
   antigen), and 0.021% (CK19), respectively. The minimum detectable
   concentration was 0.05ng/ml; the intraassay coefficient of variation
   (CV) and interassay CV were both less than 10%, with good stability and
   reproducibility. GPC3 has a high sensitivity (54.2%) and specificity
   (99.4%) in diagnosing HCC. The level of GPC3 in HCC was robust higher
   than that in healthy or other liver diseases' sera (108.67 230.04ng/ml
   vs. 3.99 +/- 7.68ng/ml). The diagnostic sensitivity of GPC3 single or
   combined with CK19 and AFP for HCC was evaluated, and the rates were
   54.2 and 90.6%, respectively.
   ConclusionsAn applicable chemiluminescent immunoassay with stable
   performance against GPC3 in diagnosing HCC has been established and the
   combination of GPC3 with CK19 and AFP could improve the diagnostic
   sensitivity for HCC.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the intrarater
   reliability and reproducibility of a standardized procedure for
   measuring passive shoulder movement in asymptomatic individuals.
   METHODS: A single assessor used a digital inclinometer and standardized
   protocol to measure the passive range of motion of 7 shoulder movements
   in 168 asymptomatic shoulders. Following a warm-up maneuver, 3
   measurements were taken for each movement on 2 occasions. Both shoulders
   were measured using a standardized order of movement. Selection of
   measurement beginning with left or right shoulder was randomly
   determined. The entire process was repeated 7 days later to assess
   reproducibility. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) with 95%
   confidence intervals and standard errors of measurement (SEMs) were
   calculated to assess the intrarater reliability of the methods.
   RESULTS: The intrarater reliability of our methods was substantial for
   total shoulder flexion (ICC = 0.82, SEM = 12.3°), whereas all other
   movements demonstrated moderate reliability (ICC range = 0.64-0.75)
   except external rotation in neutral abduction, for which reliability was
   classed as slight (ICC = 0.28, SEM = 31°). Moderate reliability was
   evident for all movements on follow-up at 7 days (ICC range =
   0.60-0.77).
   CONCLUSIONS: These methods of measurement have moderate to substantial
   reliability for the majority of tested passive shoulder movements, with
   moderate reliability sustained after 1 week, in a large sample of
   asymptomatic individuals.

AB The automated Riso TL/OSL Reader Model DA-20, often used in dating and

   thermoluminescent dosimetry related to radiation protection. The
   investigations revealed that performance of the DA-20 is comparable with
   that of the Harshaw 3500 manual reader, which was used as a reference
   instrument. All studied parameters, like stability, reproducibility,
   low-dose measuring capabilities, were at the same level or only somewhat
   inferior to those of Harshaw 3500. In particular, using the
   highly-sensitive LiF:Mg,Cu,P dosimeters, it is possible to measure doses
   at the microgray level.
   The DA-20 reader possesses built-in alpha and beta sources, which cause
   an increased radiation background. At positions just under the closed
   sources the dose-rate rises to about 50 mu Gy/h. When the Sr-90/Y-90
   source is open a quite high dose-rate of 100 mGy/h was measured at the
   position adjacent to the one being irradiated. Additionally the TLD
   response to the background radiation significantly depends on the TLD
   type (atomic number), as the radiation leaking through shielding is
   composed of low-energy photons. The dose-rate under the closed Am-241
   source was over 10 times higher, when measured with CaF2 dosimeters,
   than with LiF.
   In spite of these problems, the DA-20 reader due to its good stability,
   reproducibility and sensitivity, combined with such obvious benefits as
   a 48-dosimeter carousel, temperatures up to 700 degrees C and full
   automatics of measurements control, encourages the opinion that the
   DA-20 Rise reader can be successfully used in practical dosimetric
   measurements. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we present the application of a known method for

   samples. Measurements are performed with a laboratory-made multichannel
   analyzer that records the height of each pulse and the time interval
   between the subsequent pulses. This feature is used to detect pairs of
   pulses from two subsequent decays of Rn-222 products, Bi-214 and Po-214,
   what occur in less than 800 mu s and have amplitudes corresponding to
   more than 160 keV(e). The measured decay pairs' background count rate is
   3.4 day(-1) which is much larger than the theoretically expected rate of
   0.36 day(-1), this suggests a possible source of Rn-222 in the LSC
   cocktails. The Bi-214/(214)po pairs count rate is used to correct a
   count rate in the fixed energy C-14 window. Prolonged measurements were
   performed on a set of 4 test samples starting immediately after the
   benzene synthesis. The obtained results show good reproducibility and
   high efficiency in detecting Rn-222 presence. The measurements of the
   chemically prepared benzene from the samples tend to be contaminated
   with Rn-222 are also presented and these clearly show the influence the
   of Rn-222 contamination on the C-14 activity measurements. (C) 2015

AB BACKGROUND: There is a limited guidance for outcome reporting for
   cardiac arrest trials. This review was conducted to explore the degree
   of variation and identify trends in outcome reporting.
   METHODS: Randomised controlled trials enrolling patients with cardiac
   arrest (2002-2012) were identified by applying a search strategy to four
   databases. Titles, abstracts and short-listed studies were independently
   assessed for eligibility. Data on the primary and secondary outcome
   measures, details of outcome reporting and reproducibility were
   extracted.
   RESULTS: 61 studies matched the inclusion criteria. There was wide
   variation in the focus, method and timing of assessment. Outcomes most
   commonly reported across studies were: survival (85.2%), activities
   (52.5%), body structure or function (41.0%), and processes of care
   (26.2%). Over 160 individual outcomes were reported including 39
   different reports of survival measures of which 11 were measurements of
   ROSC (return of spontaneous circulation). Twenty different assessments
   of activity limitation were reported; only one was patient-reported.
   Many assessments were poorly defined or non-reproducible. The majority
   of outcomes were assessed up to hospital discharge (89.3%). There was no
   one outcome measure that was assessed across all trials.
   CONCLUSIONS: Outcome reporting in cardiac arrest RCTs lacks consistency
   and transparency. Guidance for improved outcome reporting is urgently
   required to reduce this heterogeneity in reporting, improve the quality
   of assessment in clinical trials, and to support the synthesis of trial
   data. The results highlight the importance of working towards a core
   outcome set for cardiac arrest clinical trials to maximise the utility
   of future research.

AB OBJECTIVE: To perform a cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the
   Profile of Fatigue and Discomfort - Sicca Symptoms Inventory (short
   form) (PROFAD-SSI-SF) questionnaire assessing the subjective aspects of
   the symptoms of primary Sjogren syndrome (pSS), for the Brazilian
   Portuguese language.
   METHOD: Conceptual, of the item, semantic and operational equivalences
   were evaluated. The Brazilian version of PROFAD-SSI-SF was administered
   to 62 women with pSS according to the European-American consensus 2002
   to assess measurement equivalence. alpha-Cronbach was used for internal
   consistency; intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for intraobserver
   reproducibility; and Spearman correlation coefficient for validity by
   comparing with Patient Global Assessment (PaGA), EULAR Sjogren's
   Syndrome Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI), Functional Assessment of
   Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Subscale (FACIT-F) and EuroQOL (EQ-5D).
   RESULTS: The internal consistency of PROFAD, SSI and total score was
   0.80; 0.78; and 0.87, respectively. The intraobserver reproducibility of
   total PROFAD was 0.89; of total SSI of 0.86; and total score of 0.89. In
   terms of validity, PROFAD correlated significantly with PaGA (r = 0.50),
   FACIT-F (r = 0.59), ESSPRI (r = 0.58) and all domains of EQ-5D, with the
   exception of Mobility. On the other hand, SSI correlated significantly
   with PaGA (r = 0.43), FACIT-F (r = 0.57), ESSPRI (r = 0.55) and most
   areas of EQ-5D. The total score of PROFAD-SSI-SF had a non-statistically
   significant correlation only with Mobility domain and with 1-100 range
   of EQ-5D.
   CONCLUSION: The Portuguese version of PROFAD-SSI-SF proved to be an
   adaptable, reproducible and valid tool for the Brazilian Portuguese
   language.

AB The electrodeposition of reduced graphene oxide (ERGO) film with
   preferred vertical orientation was fabricated on a glassy carbon
   electrode by using pulse potential method in a graphene oxide colloidal
   solution. Using square wave adsorptive stripping voltammetry (SWASV),
   the ERGO film was applied for the first time, in developing a
   high-sensitive electrochemical sensor for detection of taxifolin.
   Compared with bare glassy carbon electrode (GCE), the resulting
   electrodes (ERGO/GCE) exhibited excellent response toward the redox of
   taxifolin by significantly enhancing the redox peak currents and
   decreasing the peak-to-peak separation. Under the selected conditions,
   the peak currents were linear relationship with taxifolin concentration
   in the range of 1.0 times 10 -8-1.0 times 10 -6 mol L -1, with detection
   limit of 2.0 times 10 -9 mol L -1. Besides, the ERGO/GCE also exhibited
   an excellent selectivity, stability, reproducibility and repeatability.

AB In organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) based glucose sensors
   Pt-based electrodes are usually used as the gate electrodes due to its
   excellent electrocatalytic activity. In this paper, a cheap and
   biocompatible material, TiO 2 nanotube arrays (TNTAs), was used as the
   gate electrode of the OECT device for the first time. It is encouraging
   that the sensing performance of OECTs using TNTAs-based gate electrodes
   is comparable to or better than those of the previously reported OECTs
   using Pt-based gate electrodes. Highly sensitive and selective OECT
   devices can be obtained by modifying TNTAs electrodes with Pt
   nanoparticles (Pt-NPs) and enzyme (glucose oxidase). The device shows a
   linear response to the logarithm of glucose concentration over the range
   from 100 nM to 5 mM, and the detection limit as low as 100 nM was
   achieved, which is three orders of magnitude lower than that of a
   conventional electrochemical measurement with the same electrode. On the
   other hand, the glucose can be selectively detected in the presence of
   interferences, such as ascorbic acid and uric acid, when the gate
   electrode is modified with Nafion. Moreover, the device presents a good
   stability and reproducibility. By modifying with other specific enzymes
   and nanomaterials, it is expected that many other type of enzyme sensors
   with high sensitivity and selectivity could be realized. [All rights

AB A novel composite film of nickel oxide hollow spheres (NiOHSs)-reduced
   graphene oxide (RGO)-nafion (NF) modified glassy carbon electrode
   (NiOHSs-RGO-NF/GCE) was successfully fabricated via a facile, effective
   and general strategy and applied in the sensitive and selective
   determination of glucose. The synthetized nickel oxide was characterized
   by the hollow spheres with porous surface. The composition, morphology,
   and structure of the as-prepared NiOHSs-RGO were characterized by the
   techniques such as Raman spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction,
   energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum, scanning electron microscopy and
   transmission electron microscopy. Compared with the bare GCE,
   RGO-NF/GCE, and NiOHSs-NF/GCE electrodes, the NiOHSs-RGO-NF/GCE had
   higher catalytic activity toward the oxidation of glucose. Under the
   optimal conditions, selective detection of glucose in a linear
   concentration range of 0.6246 muM-10.50 mM was obtained with the limit
   of 0.03 muM (3S/N). Moreover, the proposed method was successfully
   applied to determine glucose in real serum sample with satisfactory
   results. The results showed that the modified electrode exhibits an
   excellent catalytic activity, good selectivity, reproducibility, and
   long-term stability. [All rights reserved Elsevier].

AB A novel cholesterol biosensor (ChOx/CS-GR/GCE) with enhanced sensitivity
   and low detection limit was investigated. The biosensor based on direct
   electrochemistry of cholesterol oxidase with an apparent rate constant (
   ks) of 2.69 s -1 was fabricated by immobilizing cholesterol oxidase
   (ChOx) on Glassy carbon electrode (GCE) functionalized by
   chitosan-graphene (CS-GR) nanocomposites. Graphene oxide (GO) was
   synthesized by a novel microwave method and CS-GR was prepared by simple
   situ reduction of chitosan-graphene oxide (CS-GO). The results of
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and FT-IR spectroscopy showed
   that the graphene oxide (GO) was successfully prepared and deoxygenized.
   The presence of the CS-GR nanocomposites not only accelerated direct
   electron transfer from the enzyme to the electrode surface, but also
   enhanced the immobilized amount and stability of cholesterol oxidase
   (ChOx). The fabricated electrode exhibited a linear response to
   cholesterol in the range of 0.005-1.0 mM with a detection limit of 0.715
   muM ( S/ N = 3). The Michaelis-Menten constant (k mapp) was found as
   17.39 muM. In addition, the biosensor also exhibited excellent
   reproducibility, stability and very high specificity to cholesterol with
   complete elimination of interference from UA, AA, DA and glucose. [All

AB PURPOSE: This study was performed to determine the accuracy of
   measurements of bone mineral density (BMD) and cortical bone thickness
   (CBT) at miniscrew implantation sites in small animals and to verify the
   usefulness of in vivo microcomputed tomography (micro-CT).
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rat femurs were scanned before and after placing
   miniscrews using in vivo micro-CT. The images were superimposed using a
   subtraction method with bone volume measurement software. At each screw
   site, the total BMD was calculated as the average BMD of a cylinder 1.6
   mm in diameter and 2.0 mm in depth, while the cortical BMD was the
   average BMD of a cylinder 1.6 mm in diameter and 1.0 mm in depth. CBT
   was measured three times on transaxial images of the rat femurs, and the
   average value was used. All miniscrews were placed using the maximum
   torque, verified with a digital torque tester. To verify the usefulness
   and accuracy of in vivo micro-CT, CBT on micro-CT images was compared
   with that measured on histologic sections.
   RESULTS: Significant correlations were observed between placement torque
   and cortical BMD (R = 0.572), total BMD (R = 0.732), and CBT (R =
   0.788). There was a significant correlation between CBT measured via
   field-emission scanning electron microscopy images and CBT measured with
   in vivo micro-CT (R = 0.974).
   CONCLUSIONS: The BMD over a narrow range can be measured accurately in
   small animals with high reproducibility of the trabecular structure
   using a combination of high-resolution in vivo micro-CT and image
   superimposition using a three-dimensional subtraction method.

AB The feeding behavior of sand flies provides valuable information about
   the vector/host interactions and elucidates the epidemiological patterns
   of American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) transmission. The aim of this
   study was to identify the blood meal sources of sand flies in endemic
   areas of leishmaniasis in Parana State through polymerase chain reaction
   (PCR) amplification of a prepronociceptin (PNOC) gene fragment and its
   subsequent DNA sequencing. Moreover, molecular assays were conducted to
   evaluate the sensitivity and reproducibility of the PNOC gene
   amplification. Besides that, a time-course digestion test of the blood
   using sand flies that fed artificially on BALB/c mice was performed. Of
   1263 female sand flies collected in the field, 93 (3.6%) specimens were
   engorged and 27 allowed efficient amplification of the PNOC gene. These
   flies had fed on equine (Equus caballus), porcine (Sus scrofa) and
   canine (Canis lupus familiaris) species. The results also showed that
   the identification of the blood meal sources of the sand flies using the
   molecular method was directly linked to the level of digestion of the
   blood (time-course) and not to the amount of blood that had been
   ingested or to the presence of inhibitors in the blood. (C) 2014

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Quantitative susceptibility mapping of the human
   brain has demonstrated strong potential in examining iron deposition,
   which may help in investigating possible brain pathology. This study
   assesses the reproducibility of quantitative susceptibility mapping
   across different imaging sites.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, the susceptibility values of 5
   regions of interest in the human brain were measured on 9 healthy
   subjects following calibration by using phantom experiments. Each of the
   subjects was imaged 5 times on 1 scanner with the same procedure
   repeated on 3 different 3T systems so that both within-site and
   cross-site quantitative susceptibility mapping precision levels could be
   assessed. Two quantitative susceptibility mapping algorithms, similar in
   principle, one by using iterative regularization (iterative quantitative
   susceptibility mapping) and the other with analytic optimal solutions
   (deterministic quantitative susceptibility mapping), were implemented,
   and their performances were compared.
   RESULTS: Results show that while deterministic quantitative
   susceptibility mapping had nearly 700 times faster computation speed,
   residual streaking artifacts seem to be more prominent compared with
   iterative quantitative susceptibility mapping. With quantitative
   susceptibility mapping, the putamen, globus pallidus, and caudate
   nucleus showed smaller imprecision on the order of 0.005 ppm, whereas
   the red nucleus and substantia nigra, closer to the skull base, had a
   somewhat larger imprecision of approximately 0.01 ppm. Cross-site errors
   were not significantly larger than within-site errors. Possible sources
   of estimation errors are discussed.
   CONCLUSIONS: The reproducibility of quantitative susceptibility mapping
   in the human brain in vivo is regionally dependent, and the precision
   levels achieved with quantitative susceptibility mapping should allow
   longitudinal and multisite studies such as aging-related changes in
   brain tissue magnetic susceptibility.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In multiple sclerosis, gadolinium enhancement is
   used to classify lesions as active. Regarding the need for a
   standardized and accurate method for detection of multiple sclerosis
   activity, we compared 2D-spin-echo with 3D-gradient-echo T1WI or the
   detection of gadolinium-enhancing MS lesions.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-eight patients with MS were prospectively
   imaged at 31 by using both 2D-spin-echo and 3D-gradient recalled-echo
   T1WI in random order after the injection of gadolinium. Blinded and
   independent evaluation was performed by a junior and a senior reader to
   count gadolinium-enhancing lesions and to characterize their location,
   size, pattern of enhancement, and the relative contrast between
   enhancing lesions and the adjacent white matter. Finally, the SNR and
   relative contrast of gadolinium-enhancing lesions were computed for both
   sequences by using simulations.
   RESULTS: Significantly more gadolinium-enhancing lesions were reported
   on 3D-gradient recalled-echo than on 2D-spin-echo (n = 59 versus n = 30
   for the junior reader, P = .021: n = 77 versus n = 61 for the senior
   reader, P = .017). The difference between the 2 readers was significant
   on 2D-spin-echo (P = .044), for which images were less reproducible (K =
   0.51) than for 3D-gradient recalled-echo (rc = 0.65). Further
   comparisons showed that there were statistically more small lesions (<5
   mm) on 3D-gradient recalled-echo than on 2D-spin-echo (P = .04), while
   other features were similar. Theoretic results from simulations
   predicted SNR and lesion contrast for 3D-gradient recalled-echo to be
   better than for 2D-spin-echo for visualization of small enhancing
   lesions and were, therefore, consistent with clinical observations.
   CONCLUSIONS: At 31, 3D-gradient recalled-echo provides a higher
   detection rate of gadolinium-enhancing lesions, especially those with
   smaller size, with a better reproducibility; this finding suggests using
   3D-gradient recalled-echo to detect MS activity, with potential impact
   in initiation, monitoring, and optimization of therapy.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intervertebral disk biochemical composition
   could be accessed in vivo by T1 rho and T2 relaxometry. We found no
   studies in the literature comparing different segmentation methods for
   data extraction using these techniques. Our aim was to compare different
   manual segmentation methods used to extract T1 rho and T2 relaxation
   times of intervertebral disks from MR imaging. Seven different methods
   of partial-disk segmentation techniques were compared with whole-disk
   segmentation as the reference standard.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sagittal T1 rho and T2 maps were generated by
   using a 1.5T MR imaging scanner in 57 asymptomatic volunteers 20-40
   years of age. Two hundred eighty-five lumbar disks were separated into 2
   groups: nondegenerated disk (Pfirrmann I and II) and degenerated disk
   (Pfirrmann III and IV). In whole-disk segmentation, the disk was
   segmented in its entirety on all sections. Partial-disk segmentation
   methods included segmentation of the disk into 6, 5, 4, 3, and 1
   sagittal sections. Circular ROIs positioned in the nucleus pulposus and
   annulus fibrosus were also used to extract T1 rho and T2, and data were
   compared with whole-disk segmentation
   RESULTS: In the nondegenerated group, segmentation of >= 5 sagittal
   sections showed no statistical difference with whole-disk segmentation.
   All the remaining partial-disk segmentation methods and circular ROIs
   showed different results from whole-disk segmentation (P < .001). In the
   degenerated disk group, all methods were statistically similar to
   whole-disk segmentation. All partial-segmentation methods, including
   circular ROIs, showed strong linear correlation with whole-disk
   segmentation in both the degenerated and nondegenerated disk groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: Manual segmentation showed strong reproducibility for T1
   rho and T2 and strong linear correlation between partial- and whole-disk
   segmentation. Absolute T1 rho and T2 values extracted from different
   segmentation techniques were statistically different in disks with
   Pfirrmann grades I and II.

AB PURPOSE: To determine the diagnostic capability of spectral-domain
   optical coherence tomography (SD OCT) peripapillary retinal thickness
   (RT) measurements from 3-dimensional (3D) volume scans for primary
   open-angle glaucoma (POAG).
   DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
   METHODS: SETTING: Institutional. STUDY POPULATION: 156 patients (89 POAG
   and 67 normal subjects). OBSERVATION PROCEDURES: One eye of each subject
   was included. SD OCT peripapillary RT values from 3D volume scans were
   calculated for 4 quadrants of 3 different sized annuli. Peripapillary
   retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness values were also determined.
   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Area under the receiver operating characteristic
   curve (AUROC) values, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative
   predictive values, and positive and negative likelihood ratios.
   RESULTS: The top 5 RT AUROCs for all glaucoma patients and for a subset
   of early glaucoma patients were for the inferior quadrant of outer
   circumpapillary annulus of circular grid (OCA) 1 (0.959, 0.939),
   inferior quadrant of OCA2 (0.945, 0.921), superior quadrant of OCA1
   (0.890, 0.811), inferior quadrant of OCA3 (0.887, 0.854), and superior
   quadrant of OCA2 (0.879, 0.807). Smaller RT annuli OCA1 and OCA2
   consistently showed better diagnostic performance than the larger RT
   annulus OCA3. For both RNFL and RT measurements, best AUROC values were
   found for inferior RT OCA1 and OCA2, followed by inferior and overall
   RNFL thickness.
   CONCLUSION: Peripapillary RT measurements from 3D volume scans showed
   excellent diagnostic performance for detecting both glaucoma and early
   glaucoma patients. Peripapillary RT values have the same or better
   diagnostic capability compared to peripapillary RNFL thickness
   measurements, while also having fewer algorithm errors. (C) 2015 by

AB Background and rationale for the study. The assessment of liver fibrosis
   provides useful information not only for diagnosis but also for
   therapeutic decision. This study was concerned with determining the
   levels of collagen III and its degrading enzyme matrix
   metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) as direct and complementary markers for
   liver fibrosis staging. Results. A total of 269 chronic hepatitis C
   patients constituted this study. Western blotting was used for
   identifying collagen III and MMP-1 in serum samples. As a result,
   collagen III and MMP-1 were identified, respectively, at 70 and 245 kDa
   using their respective mono-specific antibodies. These two markers were
   quantified in sera of patients using ELISA. Next, Fibro-check was
   constructed combining collagen III and MMP-1 together with other
   indirect markers which reflect alteration in hepatic functions that
   proved useful to stage liver fibrosis. Fibro-check produced area under
   the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.91 and 0.83 for
   significant (F2-F4) and cirrhosis (F4), respectively. Additionally, we
   estimated the performance of Fibro-check in comparison with aspartate to
   platelet ratio index (APRI) and fibrosis index. Fibro-check seems to be
   more efficient than both of them. Fibro-check was then applied to the
   validation study to test its accuracy and reproducibility showing AUCs
   0.90 for F2-F4 and 0.86 for F4. Conclusions. Fibro-check combining
   'direct' and 'indirect' markers using a mathematical formula may improve
   the staging of liver fibrosis with a high degree of accuracy and seems
   more efficient than APRI and Fibrosis index in this group of Egyptian
   patients.

AB Context. GK Per is an intermediate polar that has been displaying dwarf
   nova outbursts since the middle of the twentieth century.
   Aims. I analyzed a series of such outbursts in the optical and X-ray
   bands. I pay attention to the relation of intensities of the optical and
   X-ray emissions, and its reproducibility in a series of these
   consecutive outbursts.
   Methods. This analysis uses the data from the BAT/Swift, ASM/RXTE,
   AAVSO, and AFOEV databases. It investigates the relation of the time
   evolution of the profiles of outbursts in the individual bands (hard
   X-ray, medium/hard X-ray, and optical).
   Results. This analysis shows that the X-ray intensity steeply rises only
   in the start of the optical outburst and steeply declines only when the
   optical outburst comes to its end. However, the 1.5-50 keV band
   intensity saturates and balances on a plateau during the outburst. (The
   longer the outburst, the longer its plateau.) The peak X-ray intensities
   of this series display a significantly narrower range than the optical
   ones (a factor of about two versus a factor of about eight). This
   implies a discrepancy between the mass flow through the disk and the
   production of the X-ray emission via bremsstrahlung at the polar caps of
   the white dwarf. This discrepancy is the largest in the time of the peak
   optical intensity when the whole disk (or at least its inner part) is in
   the hot state and the flow of matter through the disk is the greatest.
   This study shows that a series of outbursts constitutes more general
   properties of this discrepancy. I argue that the saturation of the X-ray
   luminosity in outburst cannot be caused by a dominant increase in X-ray
   absorption. In the interpretation, large structural changes of the
   accreting regions at the magnetic poles of the white dwarf occur during
   the outburst. A buried shock proposed by some authors for polars is also
   promising for explaining the X-ray light curves of outbursts of GK Per.

   reliability and reproducibility of an agility T-test and Yo-Yo 10 m
   recovery test; and secondly, to analyse the physical characteristics
   measured by sprint, agility, strength and endurance field tests in
   wheelchair basketball (WB) players. 16 WB players (33.06 +/- 7.36 years,
   71.89 +/- 21.71 kg and sitting body height 86.07 +/- 6.82 cm) belonging
   to the national WB league participated in this study. Wheelchair sprint
   (5 and 20 m without ball, and 5 and 20 m with ball) agility (T-test and
   pick-up test) strength (handgrip and maximal pass) and endurance (Yo-Yo
   10 m recovery test) were performed. T-test and Yo-Yo 10 m recovery test
   showed good reproducibility values (intraclass correlation coefficient,
   ICC = 0.74-0.94). The WB players' results in 5 and 20 m sprints without
   a ball were 1.87 +/- 0.21 s and 5.70 +/- 0.43 s and with a ball 2.10 +/-
   0.30 s and 6.59 +/- 0.61 s, being better than those reported in the
   literature. Regarding the pick-up test results (16.05 +/- 0.52 s) and
   maximal pass (8.39 +/- 1.77 m), players showed worse values than those
   obtained in elite players. The main contribution of the present study is
   the characterization of the physical performance profile of WB players
   using a field test battery. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the
   agility T-test and the aerobic Yo-Yo 10 m recovery test are reliable;
   consequently they may be appropriate instruments for measuring physical
   fitness in WB.

AB Aims: Perform an agreement and reproducibility study of the estimation
   of iron overload in highly transfused pediatric patients comparing R2*
   relaxometry (R2* = 1000/T2*) to the reference technique liver/muscle
   signal intensity ratio (SIR).
   Patients and methods: Ninety-two MRI were performed in 68 children who
   were mainly transfused for sickle cell disease, mean age 9.9 years old.
   The examination included six sequences for the SIR protocol and a single
   multiecho T2* sequence. R2* relaxometry was measured by two radiologists
   independently, either by a region of interest (ROI) in the right liver,
   or an outline of the whole liver. Hepatic iron load was determined by
   the Wood formula (Fe mg/g = R2* x 0.0254 + 0.202). The validity of R2*
   relaxometry compared to SIR was evaluated by the coefficient of
   variation and the quadratic weighted Kappa value.
   Results: The correlation between R2* relaxometry and SIR was very good
   with a Pearson coefficient of 0.89 and a coefficient of variation of
   17.3%. The inter- and intraobserver reproducibility of the measurement
   of R2* relaxometry by ROI and whole liver mapping was excellent.
   However, we observed a common positive variation of one class between
   SIR and R2* relaxometry, with higher hepatic iron content values with
   SIR than with R2* relaxometry.
   Conclusion: Hepatic iron content can be rapidly and precisely estimated
   on MRI by multiecho gradient-echo sequences. (C) 2014 Editions

AB AimsTo assess the feasibility and reliability of aortic valve area (AVA)
   planimetry by means of three-dimensional transesophageal
   echocardiography (3DTEE) as compared with the transthoracic
   echocardiogram (TTE) calculation of AVA, to determine the systematic
   deviations between measurements, and to describe the distribution of
   mean systolic in relation with 3DTEE anatomical AVA.
   Methods and ResultsThree hundred seven patients with aortic valve
   stenosis (AVS) underwent both TTE and 3DTEE for AVA measurement by means
   of the continuity equation and direct anatomical planimetry,
   respectively. AVA planimetry was achieved in 282 (91.9%) of patients.
   Severity of the aortic valve calcification was independently associated
   with a poorer performance of planimetry. Intraclass correlation
   coefficient yielded a 0.848 (95% CI: 0.807-0.879) value. 3DTEE rendered
   a mild constant underestimation of AVA in comparison with TTE. Severe
   aortic stenosis according to the area criterion (<1cm(2)) despite mean
   systolic gradient below 40mm Hg was detected in 37.6% of the study
   population, and in 33.7% of the subset of patients with preserved left
   ventricular ejection fraction.
   ConclusionsReliability of AVA planimetry by 3DTEE in comparison with the
   calculation by TTE is good, but 3DTEE underestimates slightly the
   measurement. Feasibility of the technique is good but independently
   affected by valvular calcification. Inconsistent classification of AVS
   severity as graded by AVA or mean systolic gradient is observed in the
   overall population and in patients with preserved systolic function.

AB BackgroundPulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) is an important
   indicator in pediatric heart transplant patients, but commonly used
   noninvasive surrogates, such as ratio of early diastolic mitral inflow
   velocity to annular velocity (E/E'), have limitations in this
   population. This study aimed to evaluate the relation of left atrial
   (LA) peak systolic strain and distensibility with PCWP in pediatric
   heart transplant recipients.
   MethodsConsecutive pediatric heart transplant patients were enrolled at
   time of cardiac catheterization, with echocardiogram immediately
   afterward. E/E' ratio at the lateral and medial mitral annulus, peak LA
   systolic longitudinal strain by speckle tracking, and LA distensibility
   were measured from echocardiograms and compared to invasively measured
   PCWP.
   ResultsIn 38 patients (11.15.8years old), PCWP correlated with peak LA
   systolic strain (r=-0.44, P=0.01) and LA distensibility (r= -0.43,
   P=0.02), but not with E/E'. On receiver operating characteristics
   analysis, LA strain had a higher area under the curve than LA
   distensibility (0.846 vs. 0.606). LA strain <18.9% had sensitivity 62%
   and specificity 95%, with likelihood ratio 12.3 for PCWP 12. However, LA
   strain had lower intra-observer and inter-observer reproducibility than
   distensibility (intra-class correlation coefficients 0.89 and 0.75 vs.
   0.93 and 0.90).
   ConclusionsPeak LA systolic strain and LA distensibility may be more
   useful surrogates of left ventricular filling pressure than E/E' in the
   pediatric heart transplant population, with greater reproducibility of
   LA distensibility. Longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate which
   parameters track changes in PCWP and clinical outcome.

AB In children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), high rates of
   idiosyncratic fears and anxiety reactions and thought disorder are
   thought to increase the risk of psychosis. The critical next step is to
   identify whether combinations of these symptoms can be used to
   categorise individual patients into ASD subclasses, and to test their
   relevance to psychosis. All patients with ASD (n = 84) admitted to a
   specialist national inpatient unit from 2003 to 2012 were rated for the
   presence or absence of impairment in affective regulation and anxiety
   (peculiar phobias, panic episodes, explosive reactions to anxiety),
   social deficits (social disinterest, avoidance or withdrawal and
   abnormal attachment) and thought disorder (disorganised or illogical
   thinking, bizarre fantasies, overvalued or delusional ideas). Latent
   class analysis of individual symptoms was conducted to identify ASD
   classes. External validation of these classes was performed using as a
   criterion the presence of hallucinations. Latent class analysis
   identified two distinct classes. Bizarre fears and anxiety reactions and
   thought disorder symptoms differentiated ASD patients into those with
   psychotic features (ASD-P: 51 %) and those without (ASD-NonP: 49 %).
   Hallucinations were present in 26 % of the ASD-P class but only 2.4 % of
   the ASD-NonP. Both the ASD-P and the ASD-NonP class benefited from
   inpatient treatment although inpatient stay was prolonged in the ASD-P
   class. This study provides the first empirically derived classification
   of ASD in relation to psychosis based on three underlying symptom
   dimensions, anxiety, social deficits and thought disorder. These results
   can be further developed by testing the reproducibility and prognostic
   value of the identified classes.

AB The forced oscillation technique can identify expiratory flow limitation
   (EFL) when a large difference in inspiratory and expiratory reactance
   (Delta Xrs) occurs. However, flow limitation can vary from breath to
   breath, and so we compared a multiple-breath Delta Xrs approach to the
   traditional breath-by-breath assessment of EFL. We investigated the
   within-and between-day reproducibility and the factors that affect the
   size of Delta Xrs when used as a continuous measurement over multiple
   breaths. In addition, we examined how multiple-breath.Xrs relates to the
   sensation of breathlessness.
   425 moderate to very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
   patients and 229 controls were included. Spirometry and impedance
   measurements were performed on a MasterScope CT Impulse Oscillation
   System.
   Median Delta Xrs approached zero in healthy controls with little
   variation between measurements. COPD patients generally had higher Delta
   Xrs and higher variability. The COPD patients with Delta Xrs > 0.1
   kPa.L-1.s(-1) were prone to be more breathless and had a higher modified
   Medical Research Council dyspnoea scale score. In controls, the 95th
   percentile of Delta Xrs was as low as 0.07 kPa.L-1.s(-1).
   We describe a new method to assess EFL at a patient level and propose a
   cut-off, mean Delta Xrs > 0.1 kPa.L-1.s(-1), as a way to identify COPD
   patients who are more likely to report dyspnoea.

   was measured by the reverse dialysis method. Orthogonal testing showed
   that the optimum formulation had a phospholipid concentration of 4%, a
   phospholipid-cholesterol mass ratio of 8:1, a drug-lipid mass ratio of
   1:20 and an aqueous phase pH of 7.4. Rapamycin-containing liposomes with
   an encapsulation efficiency of 82.11 +/- 2.13% were prepared, and the in
   vitro release of rapamycin from the liposomes complied with a
   first-order kinetic equation. In conclusion, the formulation was
   optimized, the prepared liposomes had a high rapamycin encapsulation
   rate and good reproducibility, and their in vitro release had a certain

AB Objective: Changes in the cortisol diurnal rhythm have been found in
   neuropsychiatric diseases, including anxiety and depression. The aim of
   this study was to investigate the reliability and reproducibility of
   cortisol diurnal rhythm in healthy males, through determination of the
   inter- and intrasubject variability, to facilitate evaluation of this
   biomarker for drug target engagement. Materials and methods: This
   open-label, 2-period study design evaluated serum cortisol release over
   a 24-hour period in 18 healthy males. A cosinor model was used to model
   the cortisol diurnal rhythm, and the inter- and intrasubject
   coefficients of variation (CVs) were calculated across the 2 periods.
   Results: Three significant cortisol concentration peaks were observed at
   7 AM, 1 PM, and 7 PM. The intersubject CVs (%) for the amplitude,
   acrophase, and midline estimating statistic of rhythm (MESOR) were 18.2,
   19.3, and 16.8, respectively. The intrasubject CVs (%) were 11.2, 7.6,
   and 6.9, respectively. The inter- and intrasubject CVs (%) for the
   lunch-induced 1 PM peak and the dinner-induced 7 PM peak were 22.1,
   17.3, 44.7. and 22.1 respectively. Conclusions: Assessment of serum
   cortisol diurnal rhythm suggests that the amplitude, acrophase, and
   MESOR, but not the meal-induced peaks, have the potential to be a
   reliable biomarker in drug development targeting the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis.

AB Purpose Anatomically correct graft positioning at the femoral insertion
   site is a key factor in surgical reconstruction of the medial
   patello-femoral ligament (MPFL). Basically there are two techniques to
   define this point in fluoroscopy during surgery. The role of the
   anatomical femoral torsion on the accuracy and reproducibility of both
   procedures has not been clarified.
   Methods Twenty human anatomical leg specimens were dissected. The
   femoral insertion of the MPFL was marked by two K-wires. The position of
   the ligament insertion was determined fluoroscopically in the true
   lateral view as used in routine clinical practice. The anatomical MPFL
   insertion was compared to the radiographic landmarks which were
   recommended by two previous studies. The anatomical femoral torsion of
   the specimens was assessed by computed tomography scans.
   Results In true lateral view fluoroscopy, the mean distance of the
   femoral MPFL insertion was -0.2 mm distal to the vertical reference line
   intersecting the posterior point of Blumensaat's line. In the
   anteroposterior direction, the mean distance was -2.0 mm posterior to
   the femoral cortex reference line. There was no correlation between
   anatomical femoral torsion and the distance of the femoral MPFL
   insertion to the posterior cortex.
   Conclusions The results of this study strongly recommend use of a
   vertical line intersecting the most posterior point of Blumensaat's line
   as a reference to identify the MPFL insertion in the craniocaudal
   direction. In the anteroposterior direction, the femoral MPFL insertion
   showed distinctive variation and was found -2.0 mm posterior to the
   femoral cortex reference line without being influenced by the anatomical
   femoral torsion.

AB Previously we have shown that, using the mathematical pixel-by-pixel
   processing of a series of autoradiographic images of activated samples,
   analyst can gain information on the distribution of elements in
   geochemical samples, including large ones. The level of reproducibility
   in 2D densitometry is the key factor determining the efficiency of such
   processing. A procedure is developed for obtaining a series of digital
   autoradiograms using both classical nuclear photodetectors and digital
   imaging plates; the reproducibility of the results of quantitative
   densitometry was no worse than 2%. The results obtained on mapping well
   agree with the data of scanning electron microscopy.

AB A rapid switch from hyperbolic to isokinetic cycling allows the
   velocity-specific decline in maximal power to be measured, i.e.,
   fatigue. We reasoned that, should the baseline relationship between
   isokinetic power (P-iso) and electromyography (EMG) be reproducible,
   then contributions to fatigue may be isolated from 1) the decline in
   muscle activation (muscle activation fatigue); and 2) the decline in
   P-iso at a given activation (muscle fatigue). We hypothesized that the
   EMG-P-iso relationship is linear, velocity dependent, and reliable for
   instantaneous fatigue assessment at intolerance during and following
   whole body exercise. Healthy participants (n = 13) completed short (5 s)
   variable-effort isokinetic bouts at 50, 70, and 100 rpm to characterize
   baseline EMG-P-iso. Repeated ramp incremental exercise tests were
   terminated with maximal isokinetic cycling (5 s) at 70 rpm. Individual
   baseline EMG-P-iso relationships were linear (r(2) = 0.95 +/- 0.04) and
   velocity dependent (analysis of covariance). P-iso at intolerance (two
   legs, 335 +/- 88 W) was similar to 45% less than baseline [630 +/- 156
   W, confidence interval of the difference (CIDifference) 211, 380 W, P <
   0.05]. Following intolerance, P-iso recovered rapidly (F = 44.1; P <
   0.05; eta(2) = 0.79): power was reduced (P < 0.05) vs. baseline only at
   0-min (CIDifference 80, 201 W) and 1-min recovery (CIDifference 13, 80
   W). Activation fatigue and muscle fatigue (one leg) were 97 +/- 55 and
   60 +/- 50 W, respectively. Mean bias +/- limits of agreement for
   reproducibility were as follows: baseline P-iso 1 +/- 30 W; P-iso at
   0-min recovery 3 +/- 35 W; and EMG at P-iso 3 +/- 14%. EMG power is
   linear, velocity dependent, and reproducible. Deviation from this
   relationship at the limit of tolerance can quantify the "activation" and
   "muscle" related components of fatigue during cycling.

AB PurposeTo design and validate a desktop virtual reality (VR) system, for
   presentation and assessment of volumetric data, based on commercially
   off-the-shelf hardware as an alternative to a fully immersive CAVE-like
   I-Space VR system.
   MethodsWe designed a desktop VR system, using a three-dimensional (3D)
   monitor and a six degrees-of-freedom tracking system. A personal
   computer uses the V-Scope (Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands)
   volume-rendering application, developed for the I-Space, to create a
   hologram of volumetric data. Inter- and intraobserver reliability for
   crown-rump length and embryonic volume measurements are investigated
   using Bland-Altman plots and intraclass correlation coefficients. Time
   required for the measurements was recorded.
   ResultsComparing the I-Space and the desktop VR system, the mean
   difference for crown-rump length is -0.34% (limits of agreement
   -2.58-1.89, 2.24%) and for embryonic volume -0.92% (limits of agreement
   -6.97-5.13, +/- 6.05%). Intra- and interobserver intraclass correlation
   coefficients of the desktop VR system were all >0.99. Measurement times
   were longer on the desktop VR system compared with the I-Space, but the
   differences were not statistically significant.
   ConclusionsA user-friendly desktop VR system can be put together using
   commercially off-the-shelf hardware at an acceptable price. This system
   provides a valid and reliable method for embryonic length and volume
   measurements and can be used in clinical practice. (c) 2014 Wiley

   the chain of events in a bloodletting incident. In this study, the
   accuracy and reproducibility of the point of origin estimation using the
   FARO Scene software with the FARO Focus(3D) laser scanner was
   determined. Five impact patterns were created for each of three
   combinations of distances from the floor (z) and the front wall (x).
   Fifteen spatters were created using a custom impact rig, scanned using
   the laser scanner, photographed using a DSLR camera, and processed using
   the Scene software. Overall results gave a SD=3.49cm (p<0.0001) in the
   x-direction, SD=1.14cm (p=0.9291) in the y-direction, and SD=9.08cm
   (p<0.0115) in the z-direction. The technique performs within literature
   ranges of accepted accuracy and reproducibility and is comparable to
   results reported for other virtual stringing software.

AB Metabolomics and peptidomics are systems biology approaches in which
   broad populations of molecular species produced in a cell or tissue
   sample are identified and quantified. These two molecular populations,
   metabolites and peptides, can be extracted from tissues in a similar
   fashion, and we therefore have here developed an integrated platform for
   their extraction and characterization. This was accomplished by
   liquid-liquid extraction of peptides and metabolites from tissue samples
   and online strong cation exchange (SCX) separation to allow
   characterization of each population individually. The platform was
   validated both by a mixed set of purified standards and by an analysis
   of splenic tissue from SIV-infected macaques, showing both good
   reproducibility in chromatography, with relative standard deviation
   (RSD) of hold time less than 0.4%, and clear separation of charge state,
   with similar to 95% of molecular features in SCX separated runs at
   charge states of +1 or +2. Finally, we used this platform to analyze the
   physiological response to infection in the spleen, showing that the
   spleen contains an abundance of hemoglobin-derived peptides, which do
   not appear to change in response to infection, and that there appears to
   be a large and variable metabolic response to infection. We therefore
   present a method for peptidomic and metabolomic profiling which is
   simple, robust, and easy to implement.

AB The challenge in high-quality membrane proteomics is all about sample
   preparation prior to HPLC, and the cell-to-protein step poses a
   long-standing bottleneck. Traditional protein extraction methods apply
   ionic or poly-disperse detergents, harsh denaturation, and repeated
   protein/peptide precipitation/resolubilization afterward, but suffer low
   yield, low reproducibility, and low sequence coverage. Contrary to
   attempts to subdue, we resolved this challenge by providing proteins
   nature-and-activity-promoting conditions throughout preparation. Using
   285-kDa hetero-pentameric human GABA type A receptor overexpressed in
   HEK293 as a model, we describe a
   n-dodecyl-beta-D-maltopyranoside/cholesteryl hemisuccinate
   (DDM/CHS)-based affinity purification method, that produced active
   receptors, supported protease activity, and allowed high performance
   with both in-gel and direct gel-free proteomic analyses-without
   detergent removal. Unlike conventional belief that detergents must be
   removed before HPLC MS, the high-purity low-dose nonionic detergent DDM
   did not interfere with peptides, and obviated removal or desalting.
   Sonication or dropwise addition of detergent robustly solubilized over
   90% of membrane pellets. The purification conditions were comparable to
   those applied in successful crystallizations of most membrane proteins.
   These results enabled streamlined proteomics of human synaptic membrane
   proteins, and more importantly, allowed directly coupling proteomics
   with crystallography to characterize both static and dynamic structures
   of membrane proteins in crystallization pipelines.

AB Targeted mass spectrometry by selected reaction monitoring (S/MRM) has
   proven to be a suitable technique for the consistent and reproducible
   quantification of proteins across multiple biological samples and a wide
   dynamic range. This performance profile is an important prerequisite for
   systems biology and biomedical research. However, the method is limited
   to the measurements of a few hundred peptides per LC-MS analysis.
   Recently, we introduced SWATH-MS, a combination of data independent
   acquisition and targeted data analysis that vastly extends the number of
   peptides/proteins quantified per sample, while maintaining the favorable
   performance profile of S/MRM. Here we applied the SWATH-MS technique to
   quantify changes over time in a large fraction of the proteome expressed
   in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in response to osmotic stress.
   We sampled cell cultures in biological triplicates at six time points
   following the application of osmotic stress and acquired single
   injection data independent acquisition data sets on a high-resolution
   5600 tripleTOF instrument operated in SWATH mode. Proteins were
   quantified by the targeted extraction and integration of transition
   signal groups from the SWATH-MS datasets for peptides that are
   proteotypic for specific yeast proteins. We consistently identified and
   quantified more than 15,000 peptides and 2500 proteins across the 18
   samples. We demonstrate high reproducibility between technical and
   biological replicates across all time points and protein abundances. In
   addition, we show that the abundance of hundreds of proteins was
   significantly regulated upon osmotic shock, and pathway enrichment
   analysis revealed that the proteins reacting to osmotic shock are mainly
   involved in the carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. Overall, this
   study demonstrates the ability of SWATH-MS to efficiently generate
   reproducible, consistent, and quantitatively accurate measurements of a
   large fraction of a proteome across multiple samples.

AB This study aimed to determine the discriminative validity,
   reproducibility, and prevalence of clinical signs suggestive of
   pharyngeal dysphagia according to gross motor function in children with
   cerebral palsy (CP). It was a cross-sectional population-based study of
   130 children diagnosed with CP at 18-36 months (mean = 27.4, 81 males)
   and 40 children with typical development (TD, mean = 26.2, 18 males).
   Sixteen signs suggestive of pharyngeal phase impairment were directly
   observed in a videoed mealtime by a speech pathologist, and reported by
   parents on a questionnaire. Gross motor function was classified using
   the Gross Motor Function Classification System. The study found that
   67.7% of children had clinical signs, and this increased with poorer
   gross motor function (OR = 1.7, p < 0.01). Parents reported clinical
   signs in 46.2% of children, with 60% agreement with direct clinical
   mealtime assessment (kappa = 0.2, p < 0.01). The most common signs on
   direct assessment were coughing (44.7%), multiple swallows (25.2%),
   gurgly voice (20.3%); wet breathing (18.7%) and gagging (11.4%). 37.5%
   of children with TO had clinical signs, mostly observed on fluids.
   Dysphagia cut-points were modified to exclude a single cough on fluids,
   with a modified prevalence estimate proposed as 50.8%. Clinical signs
   suggestive of pharyngeal dysphagia are common in children with CP, even
   those with ambulatory CP. Parent-report on 16 specific signs remains a
   feasible screening method. While coughing was consistently identified by
   clinicians, it may not reflect children's regular performance, and was
   not sufficiently discriminative in children aged 18-36 months. Crown

AB Many flavour regulations around the world contain a list of so-called
   restricted substances' (RS), i.e. substances that occur naturally in
   source materials for flavourings and food ingredients with flavouring
   properties, but whose presence in certain foods is restricted and/or for
   which maximum levels are set, for example, the European regulation
   1334/2008. Only a few publications refer to the determination of RS in
   compound flavourings or their raw materials, and the latter only concern
   the analysis of one or two individual RS in single essential oils. The
   Working Group on Methods of Analysis of the International Organization
   of the Flavor Industry (IOFI) has developed a method for the rapid
   routine determination of -asarone, coumarin, menthofuran,
   methylchavicol, methyleugenol, pulegone, safrole and - and -thujones in
   flavourings and their raw materials by gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry (GC-MS), using selected-ion monitoring and internal
   standards. The method has been evaluated by nine flavour-industry
   laboratories using a complex surrogate flavouring containing all of the
   above analytes, at concentrations that would be likely to produce levels
   in finished foods of around typical maximum limits for these RS. Results
   were obtained from a total of 15 columns and sets of analytical
   conditions, using 11 GC/MS instruments, with in each case a
   determination of the analyte in two versions of the flavouring. With
   reproducibility relative standard deviations (RSDR) of less than about
   20%, and recoveries of 80-120%, the method performance can be considered
   as satisfactory for rapid routine checks on the levels of restricted
   substances in compound flavourings. The method is intended for
   flavour-industry laboratories in order for them to fulfil their
   obligation to inform food-industry clients of the amounts of these
   substances in commercial flavourings, but is not intended for their
   analysis in finished foods. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the standard
   therapy for patients with various malignant hematologic disorders. A
   successful treatment results in complete engraftment of donor cells in
   the absence of the patient's own hematopoietic system. Chimerism
   analysis, aimed at determining the coexistence of genetically different
   cell populations, is considered a useful method to measure treatment
   success. A new, qPCR based, commercially available chimerism assay was
   recently introduced. Here we report our results of comparing STR with
   qPCR-based chimerism analysis, and assessment of sensitivity and
   reproducibility of the qPCR chimerism assay. A specific emphasis is put
   on analyzing chimerism in recipients of double cord blood
   transplantation. We conclude that the qPCR chimerism assay for
   engraftment monitoring is a reliable and sensitive assay. Advantages and
   limitations of the assay in its current format are summarized. (C) 2015

AB Aims Histochemical staining of tissue is a fundamental technique in
   tissue diagnosis and research, but it suffers from significant
   variability. Efforts to address this include laboratory quality controls
   and quality assurance schemes, but these rely on subjective
   interpretation of stain quality, are laborious and have low
   reproducibility. We aimed (1) to develop a method for histochemical
   stain quantification using whole slide imaging and image analysis and
   (2) to demonstrate its usefulness in measuring staining variation.
   Methods A method to quantify the individual stain components of
   histochemical stains on virtual slides was developed. It was evaluated
   for repeatability and reproducibility, then applied to control sections
   of an appendix to quantify H&E staining (H/E intensities and H:E ratio)
   between automated staining machines and to measure differences between
   six regional diagnostic laboratories.
   Results The method was validated with <0.5% variation in H: E ratio
   measurement when using the same scanner for a batch of slides (ie, it
   was repeatable) but was not highly reproducible between scanners or over
   time, where variation of 7% was found. Application of the method showed
   H: E ratios between three staining machines varied from 0.69 to 0.93, H:
   E ratio variation over time was observed. Interlaboratory comparison
   demonstrated differences in H: E ratio between regional laboratories
   from 0.57 to 0.89.
   Conclusions A simple method using whole slide imaging can be used to
   quantify and compare histochemical staining. This method could be
   deployed in routine quality assurance and quality control. Work is
   needed on whole slide imaging devices to improve reproducibility.

AB Background and AimTraditional pathological scoring systems for liver

   architectural changes with no consideration of the amount of collagen
   fiber deposition. Our purpose was to explore a true histological
   standard in accordance with the liver stiffness measured by point shear
   wave elastography (PSWE) in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
   MethodsA total of 78 patients with liver neoplasms underwent liver
   stiffness measurements with PSWE as well as biochemical investigations
   within 3 days before partial hepatectomy. One tissue section of the
   liver specimens was stained with HE trichrome and evaluated
   traditionally with the Scheuer scoring system. The other tissue section
   was stained with picroSirius red and was evaluated according to the
   semiquantitative Chevallier etal. scoring system. In addition, this
   second tissue section was evaluated for the collagen proportionate area
   (CPA) with computer-assisted digital image analysis. The reproducibility
   of PSWE technology was explored through the intra-class correlation
   coefficient of a reliability analysis.
   ResultsThe PSWE technology revealed good reproducibility in liver
   stiffness measurements, and the PSWE values increased with the
   pathological severity of liver fibrosis on both the Scheuer scoring
   system and the semiquantitative Chevallier etal. scoring system. PSWE
   values exhibited more reasonable relationships with CPA (r=0.628,
   P=0.00<0.05) than with the Scheuer scoring system (r=0.473, P=0.00<0.05)
   or the Chevallier etal. semiquantitative scoring system (r=0.487,
   P=0.00<0.05).
   ConclusionCPA is a better pathological parameter than traditional
   semiquantitative scoring systems in accordance with liver stiffness
   measured by PSWE technology.

AB Background: The ability to accurately measure resting energy expenditure
   (REE) using indirect calorimetry, often referred to as the gold standard
   in nutrition needs assessment, is important given the well-established
   positive correlation between patient outcome and proportion of the
   nutrition goal met. While many studies have been done to compare various
   metabolic carts with one another, the literature lacks a large
   simulator-based validation of any metabolic cart system. Materials and
   Methods: In the present study, 8 specifically trained staff members
   independently conducted 10 simulation trials each using the V-max Encore
   metabolic analyzer in conjunction with a metabolic calibration system,
   which simulates patient metabolic activity, to validate the accuracy of
   the V-max Encore across a wide range of simulated metabolic conditions.
   Testing conditions consisted of incremental adjustments in calibrated
   gas infusion with a consistently set tidal volume and respiratory rate.
   Results: There was a strong, statistically significant correlation
   between the predicted and actual VO2 and VCO2 data (VO2, R-2 = 0.998;
   VCO2, R-2 = 0.997). In addition, we observed no significant difference
   between individuals performing these trials (VO2, P = 1.000, F = 0.021,
   df = 79; VCO2, P = 1.000, F = 0.030, df = 79). Conclusions: This study
   is the first to report on such a wide spectrum of metabolic activity
   (50-2000 kcal REE) using a calibrated bench model and validates the
   accuracy, reproducibility, and use of the V-max Encore metabolic cart.

AB PurposeA feasibility study of an echo-planar spectroscopic imaging
   (EPSI) using a short echo time (TE) that trades off sensitivity,
   compared with other short-TE methods, to achieve whole brain coverage
   using inversion recovery and spatial oversampling to control lipid
   bleeding.
   MethodsTwenty subjects were scanned to examine intersubject variance.
   One subject was scanned five times to examine intrasubject
   reproducibility. Data were analyzed to determine coefficients of
   variance (COV) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for
   N-acetylaspartate (NAA), total creatine (tCr), total choline (tCho),
   glutamine/glutamate (Glx), and myo-inositol (mI). Regional metabolite
   concentrations were derived by using multi-voxel analysis based on
   lobar-level anatomic regions.
   ResultsFor whole-brain mean values, the intrasubject COVs were 14%, 15%,
   and 20% for NAA, tCr, and tCho, respectively, and 31% for Glx and mI.
   The intersubject COVs were up to 6% higher. For regional distributions,
   the intrasubject COVs were 5% for NAA, tCr, and tCho; 9% for Glx; and
   15% for mI, with about 6% higher intersubject COVs. The ICCs of 5
   metabolites were 0.7, indicating the reliability of the measurements.
   ConclusionThe present EPSI method enables estimation of the whole-brain
   metabolite distributions, including Glx and mI with small voxel size,
   and a reasonable scan time and reproducibility. Magn Reson Med

AB PurposeLung morphometry with hyperpolarized gas diffusion MRI is a
   highly sensitive technique for the noninvasive measurement of acinar
   microstructural parameters traditionally only accessible by histology.
   The goal of this work is to establish the reproducibility of these
   measurements in healthy volunteers and their dependence on the direction
   of the applied diffusion-sensitizing gradient.
   MethodsHyperpolarized helium-3 (He-3) lung morphometry MRI was performed
   on a total of five healthy subjects. Two subjects received duplicate
   imaging on the same day and three subjects received duplicate imaging
   after a 4-month or 27-month delay to assess reproducibility. Four
   subjects repeated the measurement during the same session with different
   diffusion-sensitizing gradient directions to determine the effect on the
   parameter estimates.
   ResultsThe He-3 lung morphometry measurements were reproducible over the
   short term and long term (e.g., % coefficient of variation [CV] of mean
   chord length, Lm=2.1% and 2.9%, respectively) and across different
   diffusion gradient directions (Lm % CV=2.6%). Results also show
   independence of field inhomogeneity effects at 1.5T.
   Conclusion(3)He lung morphometry is a reproducible technique for
   measuring acinar microstructure and is effectively independent of the
   choice of diffusion gradient direction. This provides confidence for the
   use of this technique to compare populations and treatment efficacy.

AB There is a need for physical standards (reference materials) to ensure
   both reproducibility and consistency in the production of somatic cell
   types from human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) sources. We have outlined
   the need for reference materials (RMs) in relation to the unique
   properties and concerns surrounding hPSC-derived products and suggest
   in-house approaches to RM generation relevant to basic research, drug
   screening, and therapeutic applications. hPSCs have an unparalleled
   potential as a source of somatic cells for drug screening, disease
   modeling, and therapeutic application. Undefined variation and product
   variability after differentiation to the lineage or cell type of
   interest impede efficient translation and can obscure the evaluation of
   clinical safety and efficacy. Moreover, in the absence of a consistent
   population, data generated from in vitro studies could be unreliable and
   irreproducible. Efforts to devise approaches and tools that facilitate
   improved consistency of hPSC-derived products, both as development tools
   and therapeutic products, will aid translation. Standards exist in both
   written and physical form; however, because many unknown factors persist
   in the field, premature written standards could inhibit rather than
   promote innovation and translation. We focused on the derivation of
   physical standard RMs. We outline the need for RMs and assess the
   approaches to in-house RM generation for hPSC-derived products, a
   critical tool for the analysis and control of product variation that can
   be applied by researchers and developers. We then explore potential
   routes for the generation of RMs, including both cellular and
   noncellular materials and novel methods that might provide valuable
   tools to measure and account for variation. Multiparametric techniques
   to identify "signatures" for therapeutically relevant cell types, such
   as neurons and cardiomyocytes that can be derived from hPSCs, would be
   of significant utility, although physical RMs will be required for
   clinical purposes.

AB Process Analytical Technology (PAT) is an essential step forward in the
   pharmaceutical industry. Real-time analyzers will provide timely data on
   quality properties. The aim of this work was to develop a junction
   between the pharmaceutical industry and recent advances in designing
   stable and reproducible solid-contact ion selective electrodes
   (SC-ISEs). Those sensors can be used as bench-top real-time analyzer for
   in-process tracking of the concentration of active pharmaceuticals. We
   have exploited the long-term stability of the chemically prepared
   polyaniline (PANI) nanoparticles to be applied as an ion-to-electron
   transducer layer between an ionophore-doped PVC membrane and glassy
   carbon electrodes. The inclusion of PANI nanoparticles added more
   stability to the electrical signal due to their excellent electronic and
   chemical properties. Moreover, the fast ion-to-electron transduction
   allows obtaining short response times and the hydrophobic behavior
   avoids the formation of water layers at the electrode/membrane
   interface. These results enabled the production of a series of SC-ISEs
   with improved piece-to-piece reproducibility where the potential was
   stable over 30 days with drift of 0.7 mV h(-1). The electrodes were
   utilized for distigmine bromide determination as a model pharmaceutical
   drug; the linear range was 1.0 x 10(-6)-1.0 x 10(-2) mol L-1 with a
   detection limit of 2.1 x 10(-7) mol L-1. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

AB The fabrication of transducer interfaces with improved electroanalytical
   performance is still a challenge in the field of advanced flow based
   electrochemical biosensors. The use of magnetic nanoparticles for such a
   purpose to replace the routinely used immobilization matrix including
   glass, membrane, polymer, gel beads, sol-gel supports, porous silicon
   matrix, and porous monolithic materials is well documented in the recent
   literature. However, the application of magneto-based methods is
   restricted due to lack of reproducibility and renewal of the sensor
   surface. To overcome these limitations, the present work described a
   novel configuration strategy to integrate magnetic nanobeads into the
   flow based system to achieve the reproducible and renewable sensing
   surface. The designed flow based sensor was demonstrated for the
   detection of organophosphate insecticides using acetylcholinesterase
   (AChE) enzyme. System parameters such as optimal bead injection and flow
   rate were studied prior to insecticides analysis. The system can be
   potentially applied for on-line assessment in a sensitive, automatic,
   inexpensive, continuous and simple way for any other analyte of

AB Semiconducting heterostructures with type-II band structure have
   attracted much attention due to their novel physical properties and wide
   applications in optoelectronics. Herein, we report, for the first time,
   a controlled synthesis of type-II ZnS/SnO2 heterostructured ribbon
   composed of SnO2 nanoparticles that uniformly cover the surface of ZnS
   ribbon via a simple and versatile thermal evaporation approach.
   Structural analysis indicated that the majority of SnO2 nanoparticles
   have an equivalent zone axis, i.e., <-313 > of rutile SnO2, which is
   perpendicular to +/-(2-1-10) facets (top/down surfaces) of ZnS ribbon.
   For those SnO2 nanoparticles decorated on +/-(01-10) facets (side
   surfaces) of ZnS ribbon, an epitaxial relationship of
   (01-10)(ZnO)//(020)(SnO2) and [2-1-10](ZnO)//[001](SnO2) was identified.
   To explore their electronic and optoelectronic properties, we
   constructed field-effect transistors from as-prepared new
   heterostructures, which exhibited an n-type characteristic with an
   on/off ratio of similar to 10(3) and a fast carrier mobility of similar
   to 33.2 cm(2) V-1 s(-1). Owing to the spatial separation of
   photogenerated electron-hole pairs from type-II band alignment together
   with the good contacts between electrodes and ribbon, the resultant
   photo-detector showed excellent photoresponse properties, including
   large photocurrent, high sensitivity (external quantum efficiency as
   high as similar to 2.4 x 10(7)%), good stability and reproducibility,
   and relatively fast response speed. Our results suggest great potential
   of ZnS/SnO2 heterostructures for efficient UV light sensing, and, more
   importantly, signify the advantages of type-II semiconducting
   heterostructures for construction of high-performance
   nano-photodetectors.

AB Background: Each year, the International Medical Informatics Association
   Yearbook recognizes significant scientific papers, labelled as "best
   papers", published the previous year in the subfields of biomedical
   informatics that correspond to the different section topics of the
   journal. For each section, about fifteen pre-selected "candidate" best
   papers are externally peer-reviewed to select the actual best papers.
   Although based on the available literature, little is known about the
   pre-selection process.
   Objective: To move toward an explicit formalization of the candidate
   best papers selection process to reduce variability in the literature
   search across sections and over years.
   Methods: A methodological framework is proposed to build for each
   section topic specific queries tailored to PubMed and Web of Science
   citation databases. The two sets of returned papers are merged and
   reviewed by two independent section editors and citations are tagged as
   "discarded", "pending", and "kept". A protocolized consolidation step is
   then jointly conducted to resolve conflicts. A bibliographic software
   tool, BibReview, was developed to support the whole process.
   Results: The proposed search strategy was fully applied to the Decision
   Support section of the 2013 edition of the Yearbook. For this section,
   1124 references were returned (689 PubMed-specific, 254 WoS-specific,
   181 common to both databases) among which the 15 candidate best papers
   were selected.
   Conclusions: The search strategy for determining candidate best papers
   for an IMIA Yearbook's section is now explicitly specified and allows
   for reproducibility. However, some aspects of the whole process remain
   reviewer-dependent, mostly because there is no characterization of a
   "best paper".

   volumetry is influenced by parameter settings for VBM 8 using
   Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie Algebra
   (DARTEL) with region-of-interest (ROI) analyses.
   Methods: We prepared three-dimensional T1-weighted magnetic resonance
   images (3D-T1 WIs) of 21 healthy subjects. All subjects were imaged with
   each of five MRI systems. Voxel-based morphometry 8 (VBM 8) and WFU
   PickAtlas software were used for gray matter volumetry. The bilateral
   ROI labels used were those provided as default settings with the
   software: Frontal Lobe, Hippocampus, Occipital Lobe, Orbital Gyrus,
   Parietal Lobe, Putamen, and Temporal Lobe. All 3D-T1 Wls were segmented
   to gray matter with six parameters of VBM 8, with each parameter having
   between three and eight selectable levels. Reproducibility was evaluated
   as the standard deviation (mm(3)) of measured values for the five MRI
   systems.
   Results: Reproducibility was influenced by 'Bias regularization
   (BiasR)', 'Bias FWHM, and 'De-noising filter' settings, but not by 'MRF
   weighting', 'Sampling distance', or 'Warping regularization' settings.
   Reproducibility in BiasR was influenced by ROI. Superior reproducibility
   was observed in Frontal Lobe with the BiasR1 setting, and in
   Hippocampus, Parietal Lobe, and Putamen with the BiasR3*, BiasR1, and
   BiasR5 settings, respectively.
   Conclusion: Reproducibility of gray matter volumetry was influenced by
   parameter settings in VBM 8 using DARTEL and ROI. In multi-center
   studies, the use of appropriate settings in VBM 8 with DARTEL results in
   reduced scanner effect.

   Capacitive deionization is an electrostatic desalination (CDI) technique
   which uses two porous electrodes facing each other to remove ions from a
   solution. Upon the application of a potential of 0.5 V ions migrate to
   the electrodes and are stored in the electrical double layer. In this
   article we demonstrate CDI on a chip, and desalinate a solution by the
   removal of 23% of Na+ and Cl- ions, while the concentration of a larger
   molecule (FITC-dextran) remains unchanged. For the first time impedance
   spectroscopy is introduced to monitor the salt concentration in situ in
   real-time in between the two desalination electrodes.

AB A foam-like mesoporous polymer of melamine-formaldehyde (mPMF) was
   synthesized and further deposited on disposable screen-printed
   electrodes (SPEs) for the electroanalysis of Pb2+ ions in blood.
   Investigations indicate that the prepared mPMF is ultrastable in water,
   showing a mesoporous structure and an amine-rich composition, as
   characterized by electronic microscopy images and IR spectra.
   Importantly, it possesses a highly-selective chelating ability and a
   powerful absorbent capacity for Pb2+ ions. By way of solid-state PbCl2
   voltammetry, the mPMF-modified sensor could allow for the detection of
   Pb2+ ions in one drop of blood with a high detection selectivity,
   sensitivity (down to about 0.10 mu g L-1 Pb2+ ions) and reproducibility.
   Such a simple "one-drop-of-blood" electroanalysis method equipped with
   disposable SPEs and a portable electrochemical transducer can be
   tailored for the field-deployable or on-site monitoring of blood Pb2+
   levels in the clinical laboratory.

AB In ToF-SIMS analysis, the experimental outcome from cell experiments is
   to a great extent influenced by the sample preparation routine. In order
   to better judge this critical influence in the case of lipid analysis, a
   detailed comparison of different sample preparation routines is
   performed-aiming at an optimized preparation routine for systematic
   lipid imaging of cell cultures. For this purpose, human mesenchymal stem
   cells were analyzed: (a) as chemically fixed, (b) freeze-dried, and (c)
   frozen-hydrated. For chemical fixation, different fixatives, i.e.,
   glutaraldehyde, paraformaldehyde, and a mixture of both, were tested
   with different postfixative handling procedures like storage in
   phosphate buffered saline, water or critical point drying. Furthermore,
   secondary lipid fixation via osmium tetroxide was taken into account and
   the effect of an ascending alcohol series with and without this
   secondary lipid fixation was evaluated. Concerning freeze-drying, three
   different postprocessing possibilities were examined. One can be
   considered as a pure cryofixation technique while the other two routes
   were based on chemical fixation. Cryofixation methods known from
   literature, i.e., freeze-fracturing and simple frozen-hydrated
   preparation, were also evaluated to complete the comparison of sample
   preparation techniques. Subsequent data evaluation of SIMS spectra in
   both, positive and negative, ion mode was performed via principal
   component analysis by use of peak sets representative for lipids. For
   freeze-fracturing, these experiments revealed poor reproducibility
   making this preparation route unsuitable for systematic investigations
   and statistic data evaluation. Freeze-drying after cryofixation showed
   improved reproducibility and well preserved lipid contents while the
   other freeze-drying procedures showed drawbacks in one of these
   criteria. In comparison, chemical fixation techniques via glutar- and/or
   paraformaldehyde proved most suitable in terms of reproducibility and
   preserved lipid contents, while alcohol and osmium treatment led to the
   extraction of lipids and are therefore not recommended.

AB A rapid analysis method by coupling carbon nanotube film (CNTF)
   microextraction with desorption corona beam ionization (DCBI) was
   developed for the determination of Sudan dyes (I IV) and Rhodamine B in
   chilli oil samples. Typically, CNTF was immersed into the diluted
   solution of chilli oil for extraction, which was then placed directly
   under the visible plasma beam tip of the DCBI source for desorption and
   ionization. Under optimized conditions, five dyes were simultaneously
   determined using this method. Results showed that the analytes were
   enriched by the CNTF through the pi-pi interactions, and the proposed
   method could significantly improve the sensitivities of these compounds,
   compared to the direct analysis by DCBI-MS/MS. The method with a linear
   range of 0.08- 12.8 mu g g(-1) and good linear relationships (R-2 >
   0.93) in a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode was developed.
   Satisfactory reproducibility was achieved. Relative standard deviations
   (RSDs) were less than 20.0%. The recoveries ranged from 80.0 to 110.0%,
   and the limits of detection (LODs) were in the range of 1.4- 21 ng
   g(-1). Finally, the feasibility of the method was further exhibited by
   the determination of five illegal dyes in chilli powder. These results
   demonstrate that the proposed method consumes less time and solvent than
   conventional HPLC-based methods and avoids the contamination of
   chromatographic column and ion source from non-volatile oil. With the
   help of a 72-well shaker, multiple samples could be treated
   simultaneously, which ensures high throughput for the entire
   pretreatment process. In conclusion, it provides a rapid and
   high-throughput approach for the determination of such illicit additions
   in chilli products.
