AB A rapid, specific and simple procedure is proposed for the determination
   of free malonaldehyde (MA) contained in fish tissue. The method is the
   optimization of the reaction of MA with 2,3-diaminonaphthalene to afford
   a naphtodiazepinium ion that present a UV absorption at 311 nm, useful
   for MA determination by HPLC with UV detection. The reaction proceeds in
   the presence of 25% acetonitrile at 37 degrees C in 20 min at pH 2 using
   2,4-pentanedione as internal standard. The method has been applied to
   homogenized samples of canned mackerel fillets that were treated with
   2,3-diaminonaphthalene in an acidic aqueous:acetonitrile mixture. The
   produced naphtodiazepinium ion was extracted in acetonitrile by a
   salting-out homogeneous liquid-liquid extraction. A standard calibration
   was carried out in the range 0.625-10 nmol/g. The reliability of the
   procedure is demonstrated by linearity (r(2) = 0.998), limit of
   detection (0.16 nmol/g), limit of quantification (0.22 nmol/g),
   repeatibility (RSD 5.57%), and intermediate precision (RSD 8.92%). (C)

AB In this paper, we report on the development of a highly sensitive,
   relatively low-temperature ethanol sensor based on sol-gel derived
   p-TiO2 thin film. The p-type anatase TiO2 thin film was deposited by
   sol-gel technique on a thermally oxidized [100] p-Si (resistivity 5
   Omega cm) substrate. Anatase TiO2 phase with [101] nanocrystallinity was
   confirmed with an average particle size of similar to 11 nm from X-ray
   diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscopic study.
   Ethanol sensor study, in the resistive mode, was carried out at a
   relatively low operating temperature range (75 degrees C-175 degrees C)
   for sensing low concentrations of ethanol in air (5-100 ppm). Response
   magnitude of similar to 146% was observed at 150 degrees C toward
   100-ppm ethanol (in air) with corresponding response time and recovery
   time of 39 and 15 s, respectively. The sensor showed appreciably
   high-response magnitude (129%) even at low ethanol concentration (5 ppm)
   with acceptable response and recovery time (54 and 22 s, respectively)
   at the same operating temperature (150 degrees C). At a particular
   temperature, for all the ethanol concentrations, sensor showed minimal
   base line resistance drift, thereby offering highly repeatable and
   stable sensing performance. Ethanol selectivity study against other
   volatile organic compounds, such as methanol, acetone, and 2-butanone,
   was also investigated and was found to be quite promising. Ethanol
   sensing mechanism for such p-type TiO2 has also been discussed in the
   light of corresponding oxygen vacancy model.

AB Detection of macrolides residues in animal feedingstuffs to ensure food
   safety is very important issue. For this purpose, a liquid
   chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed
   and validated for the determination of residues of 4 macrolides
   (erythromycin, spiramycin, tilmicosin and tylosin) in animal
   feedingstuffs. Roxithromycin (ROX), a macrolide not used in veterinary
   medicine, was used as internal standard. The mass spectral acquisition
   was done in the positive-ion mode applying multiple reaction monitoring
   with the following ions (mass-to-charge ratio, m/z): m/z 837.4 -> 679.2;
   m/z 734.4 -> 576.2; m/z 422.4 -> 174.1; m/z 869.1 -> 696.1 and m/z 916.4
   -> 772.4 for roxithromycin (ROX), erythromycin (ERY), spiramycin (SPI),
   tilmicosin (TIL), and tylosin (TYL), respectively. Good repeatibility,
   reproducibility and recovery values was obtained. Average recoveries
   ranged from 98.9% (TIL) to 101% (ERY) and an overall mean of 99.9%.
   Method limits of detection (LODs) of ERY, SPI, TIL and TYL 5.1, 6.6, 6.7
   and 7.5 mu g kg-1 were achieved respectively. Method limits of
   quantification (LOQs) were 8.5, 11.1, 11.2 and 12.4 mu g kg-1 for the
   same drugs, respectively. Satisfactory decision limits (CC alpha) and
   detection capabilities (CC beta) were also attained. The method is
   simple, rapid, sensitive and suitable for the simultaneous determination
   of macrolide antibiotics in animal feedingstuffs.

AB In sensory analysis attributes are measured on samples based on human
   judgment. The ability to detect differences is essential when selecting
   a panelist, as well as the repeatability in assessments and the
   agreement among panelists (or reproducibility), which is our definition
   of panel consistency. Our goal in this paper is to identify an efficient
   method to compare evaluation profiles from panelists measuring a given
   sensory attribute on different samples, assessing the panel's
   consistency. For that we investigate two methods available in the
   literature - consonance analysis (Dijksterhuis, 1995), and repeatibility
   and reproducibility analysis (Rossi, 2001) - and propose a new method,
   based on the internal consistency test and the calculation of the
   Cronbach's alpha coefficient (Cronbach, 1951). We tested our proposition
   using a dataset from a case study in which beef cubes in stew, used as
   combat ration by the American Army, are characterized by a sensory panel
   using the Spectrum protocol. Different product formulations based on
   military specifications yielded eight samples evaluated by nine
   panelists in quadruplicate. Twenty-four sensory attributes were assessed
   by the panelists. Results pointed to the Cronbach's alpha coefficient as
   best among the methods tested, which is justified threefold: (i) it
   allows identifying attributes better understood by panelists, (ii) it
   gives a ranking of panelists according to their consensus with the rest
   of the panel, and (iii) it is analytically simpler in comparison with
   other methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB When attempting to discover the important factors and then optimise a
   response by tuning these factors, experimental design (design of
   experiments, DoE) gives a powerful suite of statistical methodology. DoE
   identify significant factors and then optimise a response with respect
   to them in method development. In this work, a headspace-solid-phase
   micro-extraction (HS-SPME) combined with gas chromatography tandem mass
   spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) methodology for the simultaneous determination
   of six important organotin compounds namely monobutyltin (MBT),
   dibutyltin (DBT), tributyltin (TIBT), monophenyltin (MPhT), diphenyltin
   (DPhT), triphenyltin (TPhT) has been optimized using a statistical
   design of experiments (DOE). The analytical method is based on the
   ethylation with NaBEt4 and simultaneous headspace-solid-phase
   micro-extraction of the derivative compounds followed by GC-MS/MS
   analysis. The main experimental parameters influencing the extraction
   efficiency selected for optimization were pre-incubation time,
   incubation temperature, agitator speed, extraction time, desorption
   temperature, buffer (pH, concentration and volume), headspace volume,
   sample salinity, preparation of standards, ultrasonic time and
   desorption time in the injector. The main factors (excitation voltage,
   excitation time, ion source temperature, isolation time and electron
   energy) affecting the GC-IT-MS/MS response were also optimized using the
   same statistical design of experiments. The proposed method presented
   good linearity (coefficient of determination R-2> 0.99) and repeatibilty
   (1-25%) for all the compounds under study. The accuracy of the method
   measured as the average percentage recovery of the compounds in spiked
   surface and marine waters was higher than 70% for all compounds studied.
   Finally, the optimized methodology was applied to real aqueous samples
   enabled the simultaneous determination of all compounds under study in
   surface and marine water samples obtained from Valencia region (Spain).

   conductivity under high temperature and high pressure was introduced.
   The calibration results of absolute ethyl alcohol, toluene and high
   pressure nitrogen show that the maxmum deviation for liquid thermal
   conductivity is less than 1% and for gas is less than 3%. After that,
   conductivity of domestic hydrocarbon fuel RP-3 was measured under 298 -
   430 K and 0. 1-5 MPa using this apparatus and the results show a good
   repeatibility. It is of great importance to improve conductivity
   measuring mehtods for fluid under super-critical pressure.

AB Objective: To evaluate the repeatability of gallium-68
   1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N '',N'''-tetraacetic
   (DOTA)-D-Phe(1)-Try(3)-octreotide (Ga-68-DOTATOC) positron emission
   tomography (PET) in neuroendocrine tumors.
   Methods: Five patients with neuroendocrine tumors were imaged with
   Ga-68-DOTATOC PET twice within 5 days. Maximum and mean standardized
   uptake values (SUVmax and SUVmean) and kinetic parameters (K-Patlak and
   K-influx) of target lesions were measured. The repeatability of these
   measurements was investigated.
   Results: Forty-seven target lesions were identified on whole-body PET
   and 21 lesions on dynamic images. There was excellent repeatability with
   intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.99 for SUVmax, SUVmean, and
   K-Patlak, and 0.85 for K-influx. The median absolute percent differences
   and the interquartile ranges (IQR) between 2 scans for SUVmax and
   SUVmean were 7.4% (IQR, 14.1%) and 9.3% (IQR, 10.6%), respectively. The
   median absolute percent differences for K-Patlak and K-influx were 12.5%
   (IQR, 12.6%) and 29.9% (IQR, 22.4%), respectively. The SUVmax of target
   lesions did not differ by more than 25% between the 2 scans.
   Conclusions: Ga-68-DOTATOC PET imaging of neuroendocrine tumors is
   highly reproducible. A difference of more than 25% in SUVmax represents
   a change that is larger than the measurement error observed on repeated
   studies and should reflect a significant change in the biological
   character of the tumor.

AB Introduction: The selection and the development of analytical methods
   have always been an important issue for testing laboratories. The
   adoption of a method requires validation because the objective is to
   prove the capability of a method as well as the competencies of the
   laboratory to make an specific assay. The range of applications of
   UMELISA HbsAg PLUS system does not include the use of serum samples
   taken from the umbilical cord blood; however the use of placenta as raw
   material is certified with this kind of sample. Objective: To validate
   this system for umbilical cord serum sample taking into account the need
   of proving that this change does not affect the performance parameters
   of the system. Methods: Three panels of samples were used to study
   specificity, agreement with the reference system Hepanostika HbsAg
   Uni-Form II, robustness, precision at two levels of repeatibility
   (intrassay) and intermediate precision (interassay) and detection limit.
   Results: Validation of the system showed the following indicators:
   specificity and agreement of 100%, robust system against temperatures
   changes between 35 and 38°C, high intraassay precision (4.65%) and
   interassays (VC less than 20%), detection limit corresponding to 1/10
   000 dilution rate. Conclusions: Obtained results showed that UMELISA
   HbsAg PLUS system may be used to detect HBsAg in umbilical cord serum
   samples.

AB In spite of increasingly widespread interest in planting physic nut,

   resource recently established aiming future breeding efforts was the
   assembly of a germplasm bank with near 200 accessions. The objective of
   this study was to estimate genetic parameters, repeatibility
   coefficients and genetic correlation between seven traits, measured in
   110 accessions (half sib families) of this germplasm bank in different
   stages of development. The results show that higher relative values of
   additive variance were only found for yield and height, and the
   existence of low environmental variation (either of temporary or
   permanent nature) among plots within blocks. Given the high
   repeatibility values found for all traits, on average three measurements
   are necessary to predict, accurately and efficiently, the true breeding
   value of an individual. Based on the results of genetic correlations,
   breeding effort should initially be use track trees with increased stem
   diameter, elevated number of branches and canopy volume so as to
   increase the chances of finding an exceptionally highly productive tree.

AB In the present contribution, a fully automated capillary comprehensive
   two-dimensional LC (LCxLC) method, for proteomic analysis, was developed
   for the first time. The investigated platform was characterized by the
   coupling of high-pH RP with low-pH RP separations thus ensuring the
   generation of high peak capacity despite the employment of identical
   stationary phases. The use of capillary columns in both dimensions
   allowed to reduce mobile-phase consumption and enhance sensitivity.
   Fraction transfer from the first to the second dimension was performed
   by means of two 2-position 6-port nano-switching valves, under stop-flow
   conditions. Values as high as 1208 and 955 were obtained for the
   theoretical and practical peak capacity, respectively. The investigated
   LCxLC system showed good retention time repeatibility with RSD values
   ranging from 0.8 to 6.0% for the first dimension and from 1.0 to 3.0%
   for the second dimension, respectively. RSD peak area values below 9.5%
   were also attained, thus demonstrating the precision of the LCxLC method
   employed.

AB Flowering phenology in an orchard is a crucial factor affecting the gene
   exchange among clones and consequently changing genetic composition of
   the seed crop. Pinus tabuliformis is now at the crucial period from
   first generation clonal seed orchards to advanced generation seed
   orchards in China. In this study, variation and stability in floral
   phenological synchronization of all the clones and possible mating
   pairs, in terms of an index of phenological overlap, were observed in a
   first generation clonal seed orchard which located in northeast of
   China. Results showed that significant variations occurred in the clones
   and mating pairs. This kind of variation was apparently related with
   temperature and humidity of the research site. With increasing age,
   levels of flowering synchronization were likely to rise in the clones
   and mating pairs. In general, the average flowering synchronization of
   male parents was slightly higher than that of female parents, female
   management in a seed orchard should be paied more attention. Flowering
   time was under strong genetic control and this genetic control was
   stronger in the female flowering process than of the males in terms of
   board sense heritability and year to year correlation analysis.
   Flowering synchronization of female parents was positively correlated
   between most years and can be a reliable reference for early and late
   predication in Pinus tabuliformis seed orchard during stage of initial
   seed harvest to stable seed production. According to their average
   levels of flowering synchronization, 49 clones in the first generation
   clonal seed orchard were divided into 11 different groups. Results of
   this paper provided the basic information for first generation seed
   orchard management and advanced seed orchard establishment of Pinus
   tabuliformis.

AB Given to the complexity of mathematical models in parallel mechanisms, a
   previous analysis of system characteristic errors is necessary. This
   paper determines backlash and positioning repeatibility of a two rotary
   degrees of freedom parallel mechanism and analyses the needed preload to
   increase system accuracy firstly the specialized bibliography in the
   design and characterization of mechanisms based on parallel kinematic is
   reviewed in the majority of the analysed studies, errors such as
   backlash are absorbed by the kinematic model without characterizing
   components or analysing which is the most determining system errors.
   Subsequently the methodology used for the characterization of the
   positioning system components is presented. To do this, procedures and
   devices used for each measuring system are described and the different
   measurement systems such as optical lineal sensors laser interferometer
   and inductive probes, are presented Results obtained show that actuator
   backlash errors are around 45 mu m having and error deviation of 3 mu m.
   The application of a contract on preload on the spherical ball joint
   allows us to obtain a backlash lesser than 3 mu m and therefore, to
   increase the positioning system accuracy. Finally the two degrees of
   freedom parallel mechanism intended to be used in metrology application
   and machining tool processes, has been characterized by means of a
   coordinate measuring machine. The mechanism characterization developed
   will allow us to determine geometric parameters in the mechanism
   calibration phase as well as to develop, subsequently correction
   procedure according to the needed preload to increase system accuracy.

AB PURPOSE
   To evaluate the feasibility of renal diffusion tensor imaging and
   determine the normative fractional anisotropy and apparent diffusion
   coefficient values at 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using
   parallel imaging and free breathing technique.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS
   A total of 52 young healthy volunteers with no history of renal disease
   were included in the study. MRI examinations were performed with 3 Tesla
   MRI equipment, using six-channel phased array SENSE Torso coil. In all
   subjects, T2-weighted turbo spin echo and diffusion tensor imaging using
   single shot echo planar imaging sequences were obtained in the coronal
   plane with free breathing. Field of view, slice thickness, and slice:
   gap values were identical for both sequences for anatomic correlation
   during analysis of diffusion tensor imaging data. Parallel imaging
   method was used with a SENSE factor of 2. Diffusion tensor parameters of
   the cortex and medulla were determined and the intra- and inter-observer
   measurement variances were calculated.
   RESULTS
   The mean fractional anisotropy of the medulla was significantly higher
   than that of the cortex, whereas the mean apparent diffusion coefficient
   of the medulla was lower when compared with that of the cortex.
   According to the two-sided paired samples Student's t test, the intra-
   and inter-observer measurement; correlated well.
   CONCLUSION
   This study shows the feasibility of renal diffusion tensor imaging and
   repeatibility of diffusion tensor parameter measurements in 3 Tesla MRI.

   imaging in subjects without known brachial plexus pathology.
   IRB approval and written informed consent were obtained. Forty healthy
   volunteers underwent bilateral 3.0-T DTI of the brachial plexus.
   Postprocessing included FT and analysis of fractional anisotropy (FA)
   and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Four authors performed
   postprocessing and analysis independently and in different sessions at
   baseline and after 4 weeks. Non-parametric tests and Bland-Altman
   statistics were used.
   Minimum and maximum percent variability were 6% and 20% for FA (85%-93%
   reproducibility). For ADC minimum and maximum percent variability were
   6% and 18% (86%-97% reproducibility). Quality of fibre tract was rated
   equal in 80% and slightly different in 20% of subjects. Minimum
   detectable differences between limb were 37% for FA and 32% for ADC.
   Intra- and inter-observer agreement were good. Evaluating the combined
   influence of the observer and of the repeated measurements the
   reproducibility was 81-92%.
   DTI of brachial plexus nerves is reliable. The healthy contralateral
   side can be used as an internal control considering that changes in FA
   and ADC values of less that 37% and 32% will not be clinically
   detectable with confidence.

AB It is uncertain the Forced Expiratory Time (FET) acceptable during
   spirometry of young people (16-20 years old) because they are not
   children nor adults. We studied 235 boys and 187 girls of this age and,
   comparing spirometries with FET > 3 s and > 6 s, we found no
   significative difference (t test) between Vext, DtPEF, FVC and FEV1
   repeatibility, while for wheight in males (p =0.0022) and plateau time
   (p < 0.00001) in males and females. We conclude that blows with FET < 6s
   but > 3s can be acceptable in young people when other criteria are
   respected.

AB Purpose: To assess the test-retest variability of central and sectorial
   macular thickness measurements obtained by Spectralis OCT (Heidelberg
   Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) in eyes with dry age-related macular
   degeneration (dAMD) and in healthy subjects.Methods: Macular thickness
   measurements of 9 standard ETDRS subfields were obtained and analyzed.
   The repeatability of macular thickness measurements by Spectralis OCT
   was assessed by examining the intrasession within subject standard
   deviation (Sw), coefficient of repeatability (CR), and coefficient of
   variation (CV) in healthy subjects and in dAMD patients.Results:
   Twenty-eight eyes of 28 consecutive patients with dAMD and 26 eyes of 26
   consecutive healthy subjects were included in the study. The coefficient
   of repeatibility (CR) for central macular subfield was 11.0 mu m (3.6%)
   and 10.4 mu m (3.9%) for dAMD and healthy eyes respectively. CR values
   ranged from 8.3 mu m (2.6%) for the outer nasal to 34.5 mu m (11.6%) for
   inner inferior subfields in eyes with dry AMD, and from 4.2 mu m (1.2%)
   for the outer superior to 22.9 mu m (6.9%) for inner temporal subfields
   in healthy eyes.Conclusions: Test-retest variability of Spectralis OCT
   was overall good for central and sectorial macular subfields for dry AMD
   patients compared with healthy subjects.

AB The proposed method for an effective assay of Cd, Cr and Pb in several
   polymer samples has been validated. The determination was carried out
   using ICP-OES after a high pressure asher (HPA) digestion at pressure
   and temperatures up to 13 MPa and 320 degrees C, respectively. Polymer
   based materials were totally oxidized with nitric acid in a HPA chamber
   and determined by ICP-OES. Validation parameters such as linearity,
   matrix effect, limit of dectection (LOD), limit of quantitation (LOQ),
   accuracy and precision (repeatibility, intermediate precision and
   reproducibility) were assessed. The LOD and LOQ in the sample were
   ranged from 0.98 to 1.18 mg kg(-1) and 2.93 to 3.55 mg kg(-1)
   respectively, relying on the analyte. The proposed method had a good
   accuracy and precision for repeatability, intermediate precision with
   respect to days and analysts and reproducibility expressed as
   inter-laboratory study. The developed method was simple to use, suitable
   and applicable to various kinds of polymers.

AB Robotic wafer handling of bonded wafer stacks (BWS) brings new
   challenges in placement repeatability and robot speed. Current standard
   SEMI M1.15 [1] does not contemplate wafer stacks >775 microns thick.
   Varying BWS thickness of 800-microns (top wafer thinned to 25-microns
   bonded to a 775 micron carrier wafer) to 1550 microns thick (two full
   thickness 775 micron wafers bonded together) creates additional mass and
   thus additional momentum during wafer movement. Without a corresponding
   increase in holding force, wafer sliding on the end effector is likely.
   One solution is to reduce robot velocity and acceleration, but this can
   lead to tool throughput reductions. In this paper we explore wafer
   handling issues for BWS and the application of a new end effector
   technology, called Gravity Edge Hold (GEH). Wafer sliding issues will be
   described in terms of wafer and BWS momentum, lateral holding force, and
   robot acceleration. It will further describe the wafer placement
   repeatability issues encountered and the corresponding decrease in robot
   speeds implemented to counteract this problem. Laboratory experiments
   were conducted to compare the performance of traditional end effectors
   used in current 300mm tools to that of the GEH end effector. An
   evaluation based on lateral holding force is included.

AB Objective To analyze the differentially expressed proteins in bone
   marrow supernatants of multiple myeloma patients by using 2-DE and
   MALDI-TOF-MS, and search for the special protein markers for studying
   the mechanism of the development and diagnosis or differential diagnosis
   of multiple myeloma. Methods The bone marrow supernatant samples of
   fourteen multiple myeloma patients, five other hematologic malignancies
   and five normal controls were collected. After removing albumin and IgG,
   the proteins in the supernatants were separated by 2-DE. Three groups
   images were analyzed and compared by Imagemaster 2D platinum 5.0
   analysis software. Differentially expressed proteins were selected if
   the protein spots intensity showed more than 3 fold increase or decrease
   among different groups. The identities of the differentially expressed
   proteins with good repeatibility were determined by PMF based on by
   MALDI-TOF- MS or MALDI-TOF-MS/MS and NCBInr database search. Results
   2-DE maps of bone marrow supernatants of the three groups could be
   analyzed and compared by image analysis of software. Forty-seven and
   fifty-eight differentially expressed protein spots were detected in
   multiple myeloma samples compared with normal controls and other
   hematologic malignancies samples, respectively. Forty-one reproducible
   spots were analyzed and identified by mass spectrum. Compared with other
   hematologic malignancies and normal controls, five up-expressed proteins
   and three down-expressed proteins were identified in multiple myeloma
   samples. They includes immunoglobulin J chain kappa and lambda light
   chain, provirus ancestral Gag polyprotein, mature oxy-cope catalytic
   antibody with hapten for up-expressed proteins, and hemoglobin,
   haptoglobin Hp2, zinc-alPha-2-glycoprotein for down-expressed proteins.
   These differentially expressed proteins reflect the features of multiple
   myeloma, and relate to the development, progression and therapy of
   multiple myeloma. Conclusions Eight differentially expressed proteins in
   bone marrow supernatants of multiple myeloma are identified by using
   2-DE and MALDI-TOF-MS. These differentially expressed proteins could be
   useful in studying the mechanism of the development and progression of
   multiple myeloma, and in developing diagnosis and differential diagnosis
   of multiple myeloma.

   instruments were compared, as were. The accuracies of the refractive
   results after cataract surgery. Methods: The biometries of 45
   cataractous eyes, 31 pseudophakic eyes, and 32 eyes having undergone
   refractive surgery were measured by two practitioners using OcuScan^RxP,
   LENSTAR^ and IOL Master^ instruments. The paired t-test was used to
   compare the reproducibilities in the three groups. Results: There were
   no differences in axial length among the groups when using any of the
   instruments. There was no significant difference in the repeatibility
   regardless of the instrument used, although. In the cataractous eyes,
   pseudophakic eyes and eyes with refractive surgery, OcuScan^RxP showed
   the highest repeatability. However, we knew that all three instruments
   were excellent in the repeatability because the difference was less than
   1.5%. The Prediction error of the instruments with regard to refractive
   results could not be determined after cataract surgery. In some patients
   with severe cataract, measurement was impossible for both the LENSTAR^
   and IOL Master^ instruments. Conclusions: In all groups, OcuScan^RxP,
   LENSTAR^ and IOL Master^ showed no significant differences with regard
   to reproducibility or prediction of refractive power after surgery.
   Among three groups, the repeatability was rather high in the existing
   ultrasound method than in the partial coherence interferometers. In some
   patients with severe cataract, measurement was impossible for both the
   LENSTAR^ and IOL Master^ instruments.

   to determine the number of evaluations necessary for a real value
   prediction of the individual and to compare repeatability coefficients
   using various methodologies. The characters evaluated were fruits
   production per plant (PFP), number of months in production (NMP) and
   number of raceme per plant (NRP), which were obtained of 72 individuals
   from Germplasm Bank of Oriental Amazonian Embrapa, in Belem, Para, for
   five years (1995 to 1999). The characters weight of the raceme (WR),
   weight of fruits per raceme (WFR); weigh of a hundred fruits (WHF);
   rachilles number per raceme (RNR); length of the rachis of the raceme
   (LRR); and revenue of fruits per raceme (RFR) were measured of seven
   racemes picked in 83 individuals from the same bank, in 1997. The
   repeatibility coefficients were estimated based on the analysis of
   variance (ANAVA), principal component analysis and structural analysis.
   Most of the characters presented repeatibility coefficient value of low
   magnitude, in all the methodologies, except PFP and WHF. For the
   character PFP the values varied in according to the methodology used,
   r=0.36 (ANAVA) and r=0.47 (principal components); while the WHF
   variation was of r=0.43 (ANAVA) and r=0.67 (principal components). The
   characters PFP and WHF can be used in the euterp plants selection. It is
   necessary four years and three racems to analyze differences among
   individuals with 80% of certainty, and the principal components analysis
   was the most appropriated methodology.

AB Repeatibility coefficients were estimated for dry matter production
   (DMP), plant height at cutting time (PHC), disease tolerance (DT) and
   height at flowering (HF). The characteristics were evaluated in 92
   genotypes in the years 2004 and 2005. Five cuttings were carried out in
   the rain period (November to March) and six cuttings in the dry period
   (April to September). The experiment was arranged in randomized block
   design, with two replications. The estimates of the repeatability
   coefficient were obtained by different methods and, then, the study of
   genotype stabilization was performed. The statistical analyses were done
   using the GENES software. During the dry period, only two cuttings were
   enough to achieve 85 % accuracy in the estimation of the real DMP value,
   whereas in the rain period, five cuttings were required to achieve the
   same reliability. Overall, in the rain period a larger number of
   evaluations was required to obtain the same data reliability. For
   genotype stabilization, there was increase in reliability by leaving out
   some cuttings. The variables DMP and PHC, during the rain period, showed
   larger estimates for the repeatability coefficient than the variables DT
   and HF. 
Y4 Foram estimados os coeficientes de repetibilidade das características de
   produção de matéria seca (PMS), altura das plantas no momento do corte
   (APC), tolerância a doenças (TD) e altura no florescimento (AF), em
   genótipos de alfafa. As características foram avaliadas em 92 genótipos
   nos anos 2004 e 2005, durante 11 cortes, feitos nos períodos das águas
   (novembro a março, cinco cortes) e da seca (abril a setembro, seis
   cortes). O experimento foi conduzido em blocos ao acaso, com duas
   repetições. As estimativas dos coeficientes de repetibilidade foram
   obtidas por diferentes métodos de análises. Também realizou-se estudo da
   estabilização genotípica. Todas as análises estatísticas foram
   realizadas com auxílio do aplicativo computacional GENES. No período da
   seca, apenas dois cortes foram suficientes para se ter certeza de 85% na
   previsão do valor real para a PMS, sendo necessários cinco cortes para
   se obter a mesma confiabilidade nesta característica no período das
   águas. De maneira geral, no período das águas foi necessário maior
   número de avaliações para obter igual veracidade da comprovação
   genotípica. Pela estabilização genotípica, observouse aumento da
   confiabilidade com a eliminação de alguns cortes, chegando a até 97% com
   apenas três cortes, excluindose dois cortes iniciais e um final. As
   variáveis PMS e APC, no período das águas, apresentaram maiores
   estimativas do coeficiente de repetibilidade do que TD e AF.

AB The discordance in results of independent genome-wide association
   studies (GWAS) indicates the potential for Type I and Type II errors. We
   assessed the repeatibility of current Affymetrix technologies that
   support GWAS. Reasonable reproducibility was observed for both raw
   intensity and the genotypes/copy number variants. We also assessed
   consistencies between different SNP arrays and between genotype calling
   algorithms. We observed that the inconsistency in genotypes was
   generally small at the specimen level. To further examine whether the
   differences from genotyping and genotype calling are possible sources of
   variation in GWAS results, an association analysis was applied to
   compare the associated SNPs. We observed that the inconsistency in
   genotypes not only propagated to the association analysis, but was
   amplified in the associated SNPs. Our studies show that inconsistencies
   between SNP arrays and between genotype calling algorithms are potential
   sources for the lack of reproducibility in GWAS results. The

AB Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is a potent endogenous
   antioxidant and free radical scavenger that has attracted much attention
   as a consequence of its multiple biological functions. In addition to
   other physiological properties, it has clear antiproliferative activity
   in several types of cancer cell. The concentration of melatonin
   necessary to inhibit cell growth is much higher than its blood
   physiological concentrations in some tumor types. For years its indolic
   nature has impeded proper monitoring, by molecular or immunological
   techniques, of its uptake by cancer cells. In this work we developed a
   simple, rapid, and validated analytical method for detection and
   quantification of MEL inside normal and cancer cells. For this purpose
   we performed high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis after
   liquid-liquid extraction of the indole from biological samples. The
   method was validated, and the correlation coefficient for amounts from
   0.125 to 1.25 mu g was higher than 0.999, with a range of recovery near
   100%. Precision was evaluated as repeatibility, and for intermediate
   precision, the relative standard deviation was less than 5%. The method
   was used to study the stability of the indole in solution and to
   determine intracellular melatonin concentrations in normal (PNT1A) and
   several cancer (LNCaP, DU-145, PC-3) prostate cell lines. Intracellular
   LOQ/LOD were 7.23/2.83, 23.17/9.07, 4.03/1.83, and 6.51/2.53 nmol L(-1),
   or 1.82/4.66, 0.56/1.45, 3.26/8.34, and 2.02/5.17 attogram in each cell
   in PNT1A, LNCaP, DU145, and PC-3 cells, respectively. Because there was
   no information about intracellular levels of melatonin inside normal or
   tumor prostate cells after treatment with the indole, nor a relationship
   between its antiproliferative activity and its intracellular
   concentration, this is the first time that, by using an analytical
   method combined with measurement of cellular volume by flow cytometry,
   the intracellular concentration of MEL has been estimated. Also, data
   obtained here explain why the antiproliferative properties of MEL vary
   in different cell types. This is, moreover, the first time that by
   increasing the intracellular concentration of melatonin, its antitumor
   properties have been promoted in prostate cancer cells. This process can
   be monitored by the method developed here.

AB In the present study, the electroanalytical behaviour of clopidogrel
   (CLP) bisulfate, an antithrombotic drug, was investigated by cyclic
   voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) techniques
   using a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) The anodic oxidation of
   clopidogrel bisulfate was investigated with a GCE to determine the
   oxidation conditions. The voltammograms of solutions having various
   concentrations of clopidogrel were recorded in order to obtain the
   optimum oxidation conditions of this drug on a GCE. To determine the
   effects of the nature of the supporting electrolyte, pH and scan rate on
   the anodic oxidation reactions, the experiments were performed in 0.2 M
   sulphuric acid, and in Britton-Robinson (BR) (pH 2-5) and acetate (pH
   3.5-5 63) buffers with a 10-400 mVs(-1) scan rate interval The oxidation
   of clopidogrel bisulfate was found to be diffusion-controlled over a
   concentration range of 0.08 mM-1.0 mM in pH 3.7 acetate buffer by an
   optimized DPV technique. The voltammetric method developed was applied
   to the tablet form of pharmaceutical preparation of this compound and
   the accuracy, precision, selectivity, sensitivity, repeatibility within
   and between days and reproducibility of the proposed method was
   investigated statistically. The results were compared with the
   spectrophotometric and HPLC methods developed in our laboratory and
   found to be in good agreement. No interference was observed from common
   pharmaceutical adjuvants.

   1.3 MP web camera rotating over the subject's head. The camera is driven
   by a step motor. The camera takes photos in every 7.2 0 angles during
   the rotation. In order to realize full automation, electrodes are
   labeled by colored circular markers and an electrode identification
   algorithm is develeoped for full automation. The proposed method is
   tested by using a realistic head phantom carrying 25 electrodes. The
   positions of the test electrodes are also measured by a conventional 3-D
   digitizer. The measurements are repeated 3 times for repeatibility
   purposes. It is found that 3-d digitizer localizes the electrodes with
   an average error of 8.46 mm, 7.63 mm and 8.32 mm, while the proposed
   system localizes the electrodes with an average error of 1.76 mm, 1.42
   mm and 1.53 mm.

AB INTRODUCTION: Sarcoidosis is a disease of unknown etiology. Little is
   known of predictive factors of fibrosis. It was suggested that PAI-1,
   uPA, TGF-beta1, VEGF, IL-8, TNF-alpha influence this process.
   AIMS: To assess airway inflammatory and fibrosis markers in EBC in
   sarcoidosis and the effect of fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB),
   bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB)
   and bronchial mucosa membrane biopsy on their production in the airways.
   MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 11 patients (5 women,
   6 men; mean age 40 +/- 9 yrs, mean +/- SD) with sarcoidosis stage I-III.
   PAI-1 (ng/ml), uPA (ng/ml), TGF-beta1 (pg/ml), VEGF (pg/ml), IL-8
   (pg/ml), TNF-alpha (pg/ml) levels were measured in BALF and EBC
   collected before and 48 hours after FOB.
   RESULTS: No significant changes in EBC levels of VEGF, PAI-1, TGF-beta1,
   TNF-alpha (respectively: 8.02 +/- 4.97 pg/ml; 1.1 +/- 1.2 ng/ml; 2909.7
   +/- 206.6 pg/ml; 10.7 +/- 19.9 pg/ml) after FOB were observed when
   compared to baseline. In contrast, IL-8 concentration in EBC (pg/ml)
   decreased after FOB (0.073 +/- 0.13 v. 0.061 +/- 0.1, p = 0.006) and was
   significantly lower than in BALF (BALF 0.95 +/- 0.62, p < 0.05). Also,
   mean level of VEGF was higher in BALF than in EBC both pre- and post-
   FOB (BALF 66.38 +/- 36.95, EBC pre-FOB 6.75 +/- 3.67 and EBC post-FOB
   8.02 +/- 4.97). Significant relationship between TNF-alpha in post-FOB
   EBC and BALF was also shown (b = 0.63, p = 0.04).
   CONCLUSIONS: FOB does not significantly affect levels of airway
   inflammation and fibrosis markers present in EBC before and after FOB;
   they were also comparable to the concentrations marked by BALF. The lack
   of correlation between markers levels in EBC and BALF indicates that
   these methods are not equivalent. Due to repeatibility, and less
   invasive, simple method of EBC test it seems reasonable to continue the
   research on the larger number of patients.

AB Repeatibility coefficients were estimated for dry matter production
   (DMP), plant height at cutting time (PHC), disease tolerance (DT) and
   height at flowering (HF). The characteristics were evaluated in 92
   genotypes in the years 2004 and 2005. Five cuttings were carried out in
   the rain period (November to March) and six cuttings in the dry period
   (April to September). The experiment was arranged in randomized block
   design, with two replications. The estimates of the repeatability
   coefficient were obtained by different methods and, then, the study of
   genotype stabilization was performed. The statistical analyses were done
   using the GENES software. During the dry period, only two cuttings were
   enough to achieve 85% accuracy in the estimation of the real DMP value,
   whereas in the rain period, five cuttings were required to achieve the
   same reliability. Overall, in the rain period a larger number of
   evaluations was required to obtain the same data reliability. For
   genotype stabilization, there was increase in reliability by leaving out
   some cuttings. The variables DMP and PHC, during the rain period, showed
   larger estimates for the repeatability coefficient than the variables DT
   and HF.

AB A method based on microchip electrophoresis with electrochemical
   detection has been developed for the simultaneous determination at trace
   levels of the main small-chain aldehydes (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and
   2-propenal) present in the atmosphere. Sampling was performed by forcing
   atmospheres through silica-gel cartridges coated with
   2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH), where aldehydes were derivatized to
   form the corresponding hydrazones, which were then injected and eluted
   into the electrophoresis system. Factors affecting both separation and
   detection processes were optimized, with best performance achieved by
   applying a voltage of 2500V both in the separation and in the
   electrokinetic injection (5 s) and using a 15 mM borate buffer (pH 9.2)
   added with 25 mM of SDS and 20%v/v ACN plus 10%v/v 1-propanol. Under
   these optimal conditions, well satisfactory resolution could be
   achieved, so that the analytes could be separated and detected within
   about 400 s, by applying a detection potential of -1.0 V versus Ag/Ag/Cl
   to the glassy carbon-working electrode. The recorded peaks were
   characterized by both a good repeatibility (RSD < 3%) and a linear
   dependence over a wide concentration range (2-100 mu g/mL). Detection
   limits, estimated for a SIN of 3, equal to 9.5, 7.2 and 9.2 mu M were
   inferred for the DNPH derivatives of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde,
   2-propenal, respectively. The application of the method to aldehyde
   analysis in real air samples is also presented.

AB In order to estimate the genetic parameters of open days (OD), data from
   Santa Gertrudis cattle in the Turiguano Island, Cuba, were analyzed. The
   first eight calvings of cows in 15 herds were considered. The sample
   included 16,209 calvings of 3,065 cows' daughters of 85 sires and 2,610
   dams. Data was analyzed using the animal model, with the ASREML
   software. Four models were used: The univariate model (UM) for each
   independent calving; the repeatibility model (RM) which included all
   calvings; the bivariate model (BM) to estimate genetic correlations
   between OD in the different parities; and the random regression model
   (RRM). OD mean was 168.9 d with a trend to decrease from parities 1 to
   4. OD heritability (h(2)) estimated by the UM and RRM increased from
   parity 1 (0.02 +/- 0.02) to parity 7 (0.20 +/- 0.08). Genetic
   correlations among OD for different parities were high, particularly for
   consecutive parities (>= 0.90). Results show that OD heritability
   estimated using the RM does not differ from the values found in other
   dairy or beef cattle breeds. Despite of the fact that estimates obtained
   increased with both the LTM and the RRM, OD h(2) model, together with
   the variation found, limit the usefulness of this trait as a selection
   criterion for Santa Gertrudis cattle in Cuba.

AB Full fat soybeans (FFSB) intended for use in monogastric nutrition need
   to undergo heat treatment, so that present anti-nutritional factors can
   be inactivated. Under- or over-treatment will decrease the level of
   amino acids available to the animal. There are a number of laboratory
   methods that can be used to estimate the adequacy of FFSB processing,
   one of them being the Protein Dispersibility Index (PDI). In this paper,
   the results of an inter-laboratory study have been presented, with an
   aim to confirm the PDI globally accepted values of between 15 and 28 for
   adequately processed soybean. Seven FFSB samples were dry extruded at
   temperatures from 110°C to 164°C and assessed in the trial with
   chickens. Eight laboratories have been determining the PDI according to
   the official AOCS method. PDI range of 8.50-10.30 has been obtained for
   describing adequately extruded full fat soybean. Repeatibility limit
   r=2.11 and reproducibility limit R=7.73 were obtained.

   scale and compression by measuring the similarity between detected
   interest regions in original and transformed versions of videos. We
   measure both the repeatibility and introduce a new similarity measure
   based on mutual information. The FAST-3D detector is shown to be on par
   with the other detectors, while showing a significant increase in speed.

AB In the previous studies of slotted flow meters, the repeatibility and
   reproducibility were studied under different flow conditions and
   different configurations. In accordance with these work, the present
   study examines the affects of the distance between the slotted plate.
   The preset 5D distance is expanded to the 10D. The flow coefficient, KY,
   the pressure drop, and the uncertainty analysis dependence upon this
   change is examined. There are definite changes in the results between
   the 5D distance and the 10D distance. As a base line, the flow
   coefficient, KY, showed 0.8% to 2% difference between the 5D and the 10D
   distance case. Depending upon the upstream flow conditions, the
   reproducibility of the slotted flow meter was affected. The pressure
   drop increased as the upstream Reynolds number increases. The result
   from the analysis of a water cut meter mounted downstream of a slotted
   flow meter showed that there are definitive relationships between the
   output of the water cut meter and the parameters of the flow.

   electrode(MWCNTs/GCE) was pre-pared at the bare GCE. The electrochemical
   and electrochemiluminescencial behaviors of chlorproma zine
   hydrochloride(CPZ) and Ru(bpy)~(2+)_3 at the modified electrode were
   studied. The results indica-ted that Ru(bpy)~(2+)_3 exhibited a good
   electrochemical activity and ECL response at the modified electrode, in
   which MWCNTs not only enlarged electroactive specific surface area of
   electrode, but also accelerated the rate of electron transfer between
   the redox-active Ru(bpy)~(2+)_3 and the electrode. The addition of CPZ
   would further lead to an enhancement of ECL intensity of Ru(bpy)~(2+)_3.
   Based on this, an electrochemiluminescence method for determination of
   CPZ was established. Under optimal conditions, the calibration curve
   showed a good linearity in the range of 1.0*10~(-6) -4. 0 * 10~(-4)
   mol/L with a detection limit(S/N = 3 ) of 6.0 * 10~(-7) mol/L. The RSD
   for determination of 6. 0 * 10~(-5) mol/L CPZ(n=13) was 2. 50% . The
   presented method had the advantage of good repeatibility and
   sensitivity, and was applied in the determination of CPZ in urine
   samples with satisfactory results.

   This novel method reduced the use of chemical reagents and thus reduced
   environmental pollution because no chemical hydride generation procedure
   was used. Under the same conditions, the hydride generation efficiency
   of BAECHG was 99.0%-101.6% of that of chemical hydride generation
   method. Parameters and interference conditions were investigated. Under
   the selected conditions, the linear range was 0-120 mu g/L for arsenic
   (As, injection volume: 100 mu L). The detection limit (signal to noise
   ratio of 3:1) was 0.64 mu g/L. The relative standard deviation (RSD)
   obtained by using standard Solution with 60 mu g/L of As was 2.0% (n =
   13). The proposed method was applied to analyze the reference soil
   sample (GBW07406), the result was consistent with the certified value.
   The spiked recoveries of piglet feed sample were 97.0%-103.0%. High

   signals were recorded with a 4 electrodes linear surface array from left
   Vastus Lateralis muscle of 18 cyclist subjects (age 26.2+3.5 years,
   weight 66.5+7.3 kg, height 1.75+0.06m) pedalling at 70 revolutions per
   minute on a cycloergometer during an incremental test. Conduction
   velocity was estimated on one window centered around the signal's root
   mean square peak for each cycle by means of cross correlation method.
   According to literature, a normalized value for cross correlation
   integral ranging from 0.7 and 1 demonstrates the presence of the same
   phenomenon over two distinct acquisition points. In order to carry out
   the measurements of conduction velocity from surface signals in dynamic
   contractions, a special care must be observed in the positioning of
   analysis window. More strictly it's necessary to place the analysis
   window on the same portion of pedal cycle for each repetition of cycling
   gesture. From our experiments, and in agreement with literature, we
   found a substantial repeatability of root mean square peak position from
   cycle to cycle. We estimated conduction velocity in -5250 pedal cycles
   obtaining 93.4% cross correlation normalized values >.7 and a 0.2 m/s
   root mean square error in estimation value.

AB The aim of the present study was to determine the repeatability of a
   running endurance test using an automated treadmill system that requires
   no manual input to control running speed. On three separate occasions, 7
   days apart, 10 experienced male endurance-trained runners (mean age 32
   years, s=10; [Vdot]O2peak 61mlkg-1min-1, s=7) completed a treadmill time
   trial, in which they were instructed to run as far as possible in 60min.
   The treadmill was instrumented with an ultrasonic feedback-controlled
   radar modulator that spontaneously regulated treadmill belt speed
   corresponding to the changing running speed of each runner. Estimated
   running intensity was 70%[Vdot]O2peak (s=11) and the distance covered
   13.5km (s=2), with no difference in mean performances between trials.
   The coefficient of variation, estimated using analysis of variance, with
   participant and trial as main effects, was 1.4%. In summary, the use of
   an automated treadmill system improved the repeatability of a 60-min
   treadmill time trial compared with time trials in which speed is
   controlled manually. The present protocol is a reliable method of
   assessing endurance performance in endurance-trained runners.

AB Different standard issuing organizations have published documents
   outlining measurement and analysis procedures to define the positional
   accuracy and repeatability of numerically controlled machine axes. The
   relevant ISO standard is the ISO 230-2:2006 - Determination of accuracy
   and repeatability of positioning numerically controlled axes. Other
   standards addressing positional accuracy include the VDI/DQG 3441, ISO
   230-2:1988 and the JIS B 6330:1980. Key machine performance descriptors
   as defined by the ISO 230-2:2006 include the machine's Positional
   Accuracy, A, Repeatability, R, and Mean Reversal Value, B. Parameters in
   the other standards that are numerically identical and conceptual
   similar to those defined in the ISO 230-2:2006 were identified. Monte
   Carlo analysis techniques were used to determine how the ratios between
   conceptually similar parameters varied under different conditions. The
   Monte Carlo analysis reveals that the ratios between conceptually
   similar parameters can vary up +or-42.6% and that caution should be
   taken when comparing parameters calculated from different standards.

   composition of 2% ionophore, 68.3 mol% plasticizer, 29.7 mol% PVC and 60
   mol% lipophilic additive with respect to the ionophere is found for the
   proposed electrodes. The influences of the plasticizer, polimer,

   and thickness of membrane on the potentiometric response of electrodes
   are investigated. The electrode exhibits linear response of the
   dichromate ions in the concentration range of 1.0 x 10(-1) to 1.0 x
   10(-7) M with 4.3 x 10(-8) M detection limit at pH 1.0. The slope of the
   calibration curve is 41.5 +/- 0.2 mV/decade. The proposed electrode
   shows good selectivity for dichromate ions in presence of some metal
   cations and anions. The electrode has a response time about 15-20 s and
   it can be used at least for 14 months with good reproducibility and
   repeatibility. The redox titrations involving dichromate as a titrant
   are monitored with the sensor, and iron(II) in pharmaceutical

   pomatia juice,and extracted with tert-butyl methyl ether.After defatted
   by hexane,the extracts were cleaned-up through dual columns of C18 and
   NH2,and the extracts obtained were derivatized with heptafluorobutyric
   anhydride,following formation of the di-heptafluorobutyryl(di-HFB)
   derivative.Identification and quantification were carried out with
   capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.External calibration was
   used for quantitation and the method was validated with blank samples(5
   g each) fortified at 1.00,2.50 and 5.00 mug·kg~(-1).The detection limits
   were 0.50-1.00 mug·kg~(-1) for all analytes.Overall recovery and
   repeatability(relative standard deviations) and within-laboratory
   reproducibility ranged from 56% to 103%,and from 3.1% to
   29.5%,respectively,for all analytes.The within laboratory repeatibility
   ranged from 4.8% to 22.2% when fortified at 1.00 mug·kg~(-1).The study
   showed that the recoveries and repeatability were good.Therefore,the
   method is useful for the animal food quality surveillance.

   results using gamma rays from a Co-60 source showed linearity at the
   calibration curve between 0.5 Gy and 10 Gy. The main TL peaks are
   located at 125, 200 and 245 degrees C. The repeatibility of TL response
   presented a maximum coefficient of variation of 6.3%. The material can
   be used in successive irradiation-reading-annealing cycles without an
   appreciable change in its sensitivity. The calibration curve for a gamma
   source (Co-60) up to 20 kGy and the minimum detection limits were
   obtained. The results show that these Wollastonite-Teflon pellets
   present possibilities for use as TL dosimeters. (c) 2007 WILEY-VCH

AB During 2002 and 2003, a total of 107 samples of raw, pasteurized and
   ultrahigh treated temperature (UHT) milk commercialized in the cities of
   Sao Paulo and Marilia (SP) were analyzed for the presence of aflatoxin
   M-1 (AFM(1)). AFM1 was detected in 79 (73.8%) of milk samples, ranging
   from < 0.02 to 0.26 mu g/L. The samples were analyzed using an
   immunoaffinity column for cleanup and a thin layer chromatography for
   determining AFM1. The parameters, such as recovery, repeatibility,
   detection and quantification limit were evaluated to optimize this
   method (in-house). Based on spiked samples, the recovery values ranged
   from 85.83 to 73.86% at levels of 0.010-0.50 mu g/L, respectively, and
   the relative standard deviation for repeatibility ranged from 7.73 to
   2.08%. The quantification limit was 0.02 mu g/L. The results of some
   samples analyzed by this method demonstrated a satisfatory correlation
   when compared with High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). In
   conclusion, immunoaffinity column cleanup gave excellent results for
   recovery, sensibility and sample through put. Despite the high rate of
   occurrence of AFM(1) in samples in both cities, the contamination level
   could not be considered a serious public health hazard, according to
   Brazilian legislation.

AB A selection of queens of Melipona scutellaris through the most
   productive colonies were carried out during eight months in an orange
   honeyflow. Each of the colonies was evaluated by its production, that
   is, the gross weight production ( pollen, brood, geopropolis and wax of
   each hive). With this data a coefficient of repeatability was estimated
   by the intraclass correlation method, obtained r = 0.835 ± 0.071. The
   repeatibility is very high showing that the analysed data (production)
   is repeatable. Selection was then carried out using the regression
   coefficient of each colony and the respective production gain. Using
   these data the colonies were divided into three groups according to the
   method Vencovsky and Kerr (1982): a with the colonies of highest
   productivity, b of least productivity, and c of intermediary
   productivity. Colonies with the highest production (Group a) gave their
   queens to those of the lowest production (Group b) after their queens
   were taken out and killed; while those of intermediate (Group c) stayed
   with the same queens during the entire experiment both before and after
   the selection. The modifications in weight, that is, the genetic
   response was (R)= 7.98 gr per day which indicated a selection gain. The
   estimate of the realized herdability is twice the rate of the response
   to selection (R) by the selection differential (S2). That is then
   h²R=2(R/S2) then h²R= 0.166 
Y4 Foi feita uma seleção de rainhas durante oito meses com 10 colônias
   aproveitando uma florada de laranjeiras. Cada colônia teve sua produção
   total (mel, pólen, crias, geoprópolis e cera) avaliada. Estimamos com
   estes dados o coeficiente de repetibilidade por meio de uma correlação
   intraclasse e obtivemos r = 0.835 ± 0,071. Esse valor é alto e mostra
   que a produção de cada colônia é repetível. Executamos uma seleção
   usando o coeficiente de regressão de cada colônia e o respectivo ganho
   de produção . No uso desses dados, as colmeias foram divididas em três
   grupos, de acordo com o método de Vencovsky e Kerr (1982): a contendo as
   colônias de maior produtividade; b com as colônias que apresentaram
   menor produtividade e c com as colônias de produção intermediárias. As
   colônias com maior produção (grupo a) deram suas rainhas para aquelas
   com menor produção (grupo b) cujas rainhas foram retiradas e mortas. As
   colônias do grupo c permaneceram com suas próprias rainhas durante todo
   o experimento tanto antes como depois da seleção.As modificações no
   peso, quer dizer, a resposta genética ocorrida foi (R)= 7.98 gramas por
   dia, indicando um ganho proveniente da seleção. A estimativa da
   herdabilidade é o dobro da resposta à seleção dividida pela seleção
   diferencial (S2), ou seja: , logo = 0,166.

AB Chloroanisoles can migrate from the cork stopper in wine bottles to the
   wine and give it a musty taint so it is important to find a method by
   which they can be determined. The aim of this paper is to develop a
   method for quantifying 2,4-dichloroanisole, 2,6-dichloroanisole,
   2,4,6-trichloroanisole, 2,3,4,6-tetrachloroanisole and
   2,3,4,5,6-pentachloroanisole in cork using headspace solid-phase
   microextraction and gas chromatography with electron capture detection.
   After we had prepared the cork standards that were so essential to the
   work we optimised the parameters that most influence headspace
   solid-phase microextraction: fibre coating, vial volume, cork, kind and
   volume of solvent to help the extraction, extraction temperature and
   time, ionic strength and stirring. The method quantifies the total
   amount of chloroanisoles in cork stoppers (natural, agglomerated,
   agglomerated with disks and sparkling wine stoppers), at suitable
   concentrations so that the capacity of these compounds to give wine a
   musty taint can be evaluated. The quantification limits are:
   2,6-dichloroanisole (8.6 ng/g), 2,4,6-trichloroanisole (0.8 ng/g),
   2,4-dichloroanisole (3.5 ng/g), 2,3,4,6-tetrachloroanisole (0.6 ng/g),
   2,3,4,5,6-pentachloroanisole (0.8 ng/g). The other quality parameters
   are: recoveries (90.3-105.8%), repeatability (4-13% (RSD expressed)) and
   intermediate precision (5-14% (RSD expressed)). (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB The advantages of using a narrow-bore column in headspace solid-phase
   microextraction-gas chromatographic (HS-SPME-GC) analysis are
   investigated. An automated rapid HS-SPME-GC method for the determination
   of volatile compounds in a complex sample (bergamot essential oil) was
   developed. A low-capacity (7 mu m) SPME fibre was employed, enabling a
   short equilibration time (15 min). The absorbed volatile compounds were
   then separated in 12.5 min on a 10 m x 0.1 mm I.D. capillary. The fast
   GC method was characterized by relatively moderate GC parameters (head
   pressure: 173 kPa; temperature program rate: 12 degrees C/min). The
   employment of the low-capacity fibre also suited the reduced sample
   capacity of the capillary employed, hence column overloading was
   avoided. Analytical repeatibility was determined in terms of retention
   times (maximum RSD: 0.32%) and peak areas (maximum RSD: 9.80%). The
   results obtained were compared to those derived from a conventional
   HS-SPME-GC (a 30 mu m SPME fibre and 0.25 mm I.D. capillary were used)
   application on the same sample. In this respect, a great reduction of
   analytical time was obtained both with regard to the conventional SPME
   equilibration and GC run times, which both required 50 min. Peak
   resolution was altogether comparable in both applications. Although a
   slight loss in terms of sensitivity was observed in the rapid approach
   (generally within the 25-50% range), this did not impair the detection
   of all peaks of interest. Finally, the selectivities of the 30 and 7 mu
   m fibres were evaluated and, as expected, these were in good agreement.

   in the mid-infrared range (5-10 micrometers) was performed. Double split
   ring and complementary double split ring resonators (SRR and CSRR) with

   aye the basic building blocks to achieve a negative effective dielectric
   permittivity and magnetic permeability. Scanning probe nanolithography
   with z-scanner movement was used to fabricate straight-line and
   curvilinear segments with a line width of 80-120 nm. The geometries were
   delineated in 20 nm thin silver layers sputter-deposited on a positive
   photoresist substrate spin-coated on polished single crystal silicon
   wafers, as well as on polycarbonate slabs. The morphology of the
   structures was characterized by atomic force microscopy. The feature
   repeatibility was 60-150 nm, depending on the process conditions and the
   feature complexity. The nanolithographic groove depth in different
   samples ranged from 4 nm to 80 nm.

AB A rapid and sensitive RP HPLC method was developed for the routine
   control analysis of eletriptan hydrobromide and its organic impurity UK
   120.413 in Relpax(R) tablets. The chromatography was performed at 20
   degrees C using a C-18 XTerra(TM) (5 pm, 150 x 4,6 mm) column at a flow
   rate 1.0 ml/min. The drug and its impurity were detected at 225 rim. The
   mobile phase consisted of TEA (1%) - methanol (67.2:32.8 v/v), the pH of
   which was adjusted to 6.8 with 85% orthophosphoric acid. Quantification
   was accomplished by the internal standard method. The developed RP HPLC
   method was validated by testing: accuracy, precision, repeatibility,
   specificity, detection limit, quantification limit, linearity,
   robustness and sensitivity. High linearity of the analytical procedure
   was confirmed over the concentration range of 0.05-1.00 mg/ml for
   eletriptan hydrobromide and from 0.10-1.50 mu g/ml for UK 120.413, with
   correlation coefficients greater than r = 0.995. The low value of the
   RSD expressed the good repeatability and precision of the method.
   Experimental design and a response surface method were used to test
   robustness of the analytical procedure and to evaluate the effect of
   variation of the method parameters, namely the mobile phase composition,
   pH and temperature. They showed small deviations from the method
   setting. The good recovery and low RSD confirm the suitability of the
   proposed RP HPLC method for the routine determination of eletriptan
   hydrobromide and its impurity UK 120.413 in Relpax(R) tables.

AB Sensory profiling is an important activity for many sensory
   laboratories. Validation of profiles is based on two approaches: the
   intralaboratory validation and the interlaboratories validation. In the
   group validation, the group's repeatibility and discriminant power are
   measured. In the interlaboratories validation, the agreement between
   groups is also measured. Surprisingly, the literature is poor on intra
   panel studies, but well documented on inter panel studies. However, both
   approaches present the two same critical points: the choice of products
   to consider and the indices to compute. From two examples, for
   intralaboratory and interlaboratories validation, we review the
   encountered problems and the given answers. As these answers are
   multiple, some choices are absolutely necessary to facilitate the work
   of the practitioners of sensory world. In this matter, the first
   comparisons performed by Profi-Sens (www.profisens.com) are very
   interesting. In France, the AFNOR commission "Sensory Analysis" has
   created a working group whose aim is to propose a suitable norm for the
   companies which collect and provide sensory data.

AB Development and refinement of sample preparation protocols for
   retrospective detection and identification of chemical warfare agents
   (CWAs) and their markers is of paramount importance from verification
   point of view of chemical weapons convention (CWC). Precursors of
   nitrogen- and sulfur-mustards (NMPs and SMPs) are polar adsorptive
   markers of vesicant class of CWAs. Their detection in a given
   environmental sample may imply past contamination with mustards. For the
   efficient extraction of NMPs and SMPs from soil, on-matrix
   derivatisation-extraction (OMDEX) method was developed and optimized.
   The method involved trifluoroacetylation of analytes on soil itself,
   followed by extraction with suitable solvent. The extracted samples were
   analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). This virtually
   single-step sample preparation offered better recoveries of NMPs and
   SMPs in comparison to conventionally used extraction, evaporation and
   derivatisation. The best recoveries of analytes were obtained with
   acetonitrile by OMDEX method. Dynamic linearity range of
   trifluoroacetylated (TFA) derivatives of NMPs and SMPs was 1-12 &mu; g/L
   in GC-MS analysis in SIM mode. Repeatability and reproducibility of this
   technique containing 5 and 10 &mu; g analytes/gm soil was &LT; 3.3% and
   &LT; 4.6%, respectively. OMDEX technique was finally applied for the
   detection of TFA derivatives of NMPs in the soil sample supplied in 16th
   official proficiency test conducted by OPCW in October 2004. &COPY; 2005

   combination of MSPD and subsequent solid-phase extraction. Silica gel

   of the procedures were optimized. Thyreostats were derivatized with
   pentafluorobenzylbromide (PFBBr) in strong basic medium and then with
   N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide (MSTEA), which can
   improve the yields of derivatization for thyreostats, the repeatability,
   and therefore the limits of detection (LOD) of thyreostats. The limits
   of detection reached 10 mu g/kg (2-thiouracil, 6-methyl-2thiouracil and
   6-propyl-2-thiouracil), 20 mu g/kg (6-phenyl-2-thiouracil) and 50 mu

   solid-phase extraction on silica columns. Both the final feed and premix
   extracts were analyzed by reversed-phase LC on a NovaPak C18 column (3.9
   x 150 mm; 4 mu m) with methanol-acetonitrile-water-phosphoric acid (340
   + 350 + 308 + 2, v/v) as mobile phase. Fluorescence detection was
   performed at excitation and emission wavelengths of 265 and 390 nm,
   respectively. Alternatively, post-column addition of sulfuric acid
   solution was used to decrease the determination limit. The recovery of
   methylbenzoquate, in a concentration range of 0.5-10 mg/kg, was 105.0
   +/- 7.3%. The limit of quantitation, based on a signal-to-noise ratio of
   10:1, was 48 mu g/kg. The developed LC method was tested in an
   interlaboratory study. The interlaboratory repeatibility for both
   samples ranged from 7.1 to 10.6%; the interlaboratory reproducibility
   ranged from 11.7 to 15.2%. With the post-column addition of sulfuric
   acid, the limit of quantification was decreased by a factor of 50.
   Overall, the developed method is highly selective and can be used in
   routine analysis.

AB Many multiphase flow systems involve complex geometry and/or chaotic
   flows. For this reason, exact solutions to initial value problems
   (giving, for example, the exact initial positions of all bubbles flowing
   in a system) contain both too much information and too little
   information, in a sense that will be made clear. For many purposes, flow
   details (such as ripples on bubbles) can be neglected, or their overall
   effect need be considered. Information about such details is extraneous.
   For some systems, the boundary conditions and initial conditions cannot
   be controlled sufficiently to allow repeatable experiments. A correct
   detailed prediction for such a system cannot be made because the initial
   and boundary conditions cannot be specified. Moreover, predictions for
   such a system cannot be compared in detail to the experiment.
   Consequently, predictions for averages have become the standard for
   complex flow systems. In this paper, the averaging process is elucidated
   for situations where the flow is simple. The central concept is the
   evolution of an appropriate probability density function. The evolution
   (rate of change) of the probability density function is studied for
   linear, logistic, and Lorenz dynamics. We build the concepts and
   solutions toward the problem of turbulent dispersion of particles. The
   effect of uncertainty in the initial conditions, and the dispersion by
   random flow is described for the evolution of a swarm of particles. (c)

AB Tower Malacky, the Slovakian subsidiary of US Company Tower, is a
   leading supplier of pressed parts to blue-chip motor manufacturers
   across Europe, such as Porsche and Volkswagen. Precision coordinate
   measuring machines are the heart of the company's rigorous quality
   control programmes. A recent low-cost upgrade of these machines with
   Reinshaw's TP20 stylus-changing probe system has given the company
   dramatic benefits. The simple upgrade has saved hours of set-up time and
   significantly improved process repeatibility. Inspection of components
   takes place on two automatic CMMs, typically taking 3 hours to measure
   complex parts. Multiple points are taken on critical surfaces, comparing
   measured values to CAD data.

AB This paper treats the design, fabrication, and testing of a wafer-grown
   thermal flux sensor for use in plasma etch processes. This sensor is
   capable of separately resolving the heating due to ion flux from that
   due to surface chemical reactions. The sensor is constructed using a
   modified Gardon gauge structure with an added antenna structure. This
   addition allows the exposed portion of the gauge to be formed from any
   plasma etchable material while still retaining the high sensitivity
   inherent in a Gargon-type heat flux sensor. The fabrication process for
   the sensor uses standard MEMS process steps, with an XeF2 postprocess
   structure release. Bench-top experimental results showing the
   sensitivity (0.25 muV/W/m(2)) and repeatibility (8.3 W/m(2)) are
   presented and discussed, and preliminary efforts at in situ etch
   monitoring are discussed.

AB The higher requirements for beam injection stability at the APS storage
   ring (SR) demand improvement of pulsed power supplies for the septum
   magnets. The new specification for the current repeatibility is 1/2000.
   The upgrade will be performed in two stages. In the first stage we will
   implement a new voltage regulation circuit in the power supply with a
   new timing sequence that will provide better voltage regulation
   performance. A common design is made for all of the septum magnet power
   supplies (SMPSs) at the APS. The new regulation module has already been
   tested on both thin and thick SMPSs. The test shows that the achieved
   voltage regulation is much better than 1/2000. Combined with a current
   feedback loop, it can provide a shot-to-shot current repeatability
   better than 1/2000. The second phase of the upgrade will develop the
   current feedback loop and control algorithm. This paper will decribe the
   design and test results for the first phase only.

AB This work describes the effect of a variety of metal ions as quenchers
   of the fluorescence of naphthalene, in aqueous micellar solutions of
   sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The quenching by the metal ions can be
   adequately described by the Stern - Volmer equation and the best signal
   to noise ratios are obtained with low micellized detergent
   concentrations. Apparent Stern - Volmer constants decrease in the order:
   Fe3+ > Cu2+ > Pb2+ > Cr3+ > Ni2+ and directly reflect the relative
   sensitivity of the method for these ions. Detection limits ( defined as
   three times the standard deviation of the blank for n = 10) for the
   fluorescence quenching of naphthalene by the metal ions in aqueous
   micellar SDS are in the range of 1.0 x 10(-6) to 1.0 x 10(-5) mol
   dm(-3). The proposed fluorescence quenching method shows good
   repeatibility for a variety of added quencher metal ions, indicating
   that anionic micelle-enhanced fluorescence quenching by metal ions
   constitutes an analytical method of rather general application.

AB Sawn wood from curved logs is prone to have cross grain and contain
   compression wood, both of which affect the dimensional stability.
   Different types of curvature can, however, have different effects on
   both the sawing process and board quality, which is why a standard
   measure of bow height alone is not enough to sort logs or set the log
   quality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the repeatability when
   sorting curved saw logs using a 3D log scanner. In the study, 56 logs
   were categorized into five different curvature types and four different
   degrees of curvature severity. The logs were run through a Rema 3D log
   scanner four times, and the external geometry was recorded. From the
   geometry data, variables describing log shapes were calculated and used
   to develop models using linear discriminant analysis, which was used to
   classify the logs according to curvature type. The accuracy and
   repeatability were evaluated for the classifications with Cohen's simple
   Kappa coefficient. The results of this study showed that it is possible
   to sort logs by curve type using a 3D log scanner, although sorting by
   curve type was largely dependent on curve severity. The repeatability
   test determined that the chance of a curved log being graded identically
   two consecutive times was 0.40, measured as kappa.

AB Reproductive phenology was studied in a Pinus radiata seed orchard,
   located in northern Spain. Timing of flowering was determined on the
   basis of data recorded by visual observations made in 2000, 2001 and
   2002. The genetic and environmental factors affecting female and male
   phenology, as well as reproductive synchronization, were studied. The
   dates of beginning of the receptive phase and pollen shedding varied
   greatly from year to year but the variation on the sum of degree-days
   was low. In general, the flowering periods of the different clones
   overlapped. The clonal differences in the phenology of receptivity and
   pollen shedding were in most cases statistically significant. The time
   needed to reach flowering stages was under strong genetic control.
   Genetic control was stronger for the female than the male flowering
   process. However, correlations between years were stronger for male than
   for female flowering phenology. The male flowering clones that best
   synchronized with the females appeared to be those that started
   flowering earlier. The phenological overlap index varied greatly among
   clones, whether male or female, and also among years.

   over or under legislation limit established (50 mug l(-1)) with high
   reliability. The detection limit found was 9 mug l(-1) and the linear
   dynamic range was 15-125 mug l(-1) of Cu(II). Repeatibility and
   reproducibility studies gave good precision and accuracy with recovery
   near 100%. Under these conditions, the method resulted selective and
   only Fe(II), Fe(Ill) and Pb(II) could interfere, but at a concentration
   level higher than their normal concentration in waters. The proposed
   method was found to be highly reliable for screening purposes and it was
   successfully applied to the screening of a variety of real water

   in progress over a significant part of their distribution area and
   resource managers demand improved methods to monitor, analyse and

   level. An amplified capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was
   developed to detect antibodies to Sarcoptes scabiei in chamois
   (Rupicapra spp.) serum. The method used the biotin-avidin amplification
   system and was validated on a panel of 144 serum samples, of which 40
   were obtained from scabietic and 104 from healthy unexposed individuals
   originating from a scabies-free area. The antigen, a whole body extract
   of the various developmental stages of S. scabiei, was prepared from
   mites actively leaving the skin lesions of naturally infested red foxes
   ( Vulpes vulpes). The resulting LAB-ELISA was characterised by 93%
   sensitivity, 97% specificity and a high degree of repeatibility. A
   single seroreactor was found amongst 32 chamois affected with skin
   pathologies other than scabies, including infestations by other Acarina
   ( Trombicula spp. and Ixodid ticks). Antibodies to S. scabiei were
   present in 26 out of 169 sera (15.4%) obtained by clinically healthy
   chamois within a scabies outbreak area, indicating that asymptomatic
   infestations by S. scabiei can be revealed by serological methods in the

AB We investigated the application of a fully automated computer algorithm
   for identifying vessels of the conjunctiva from their scleral surround,
   and compared measures of vessel width with established methods. Vessel
   widths at 101 locations (ranging from 20 to 140 mum), from 12 patients,
   were measured from film and digital images, using a variety of methods,
   and compared. Widths were measured manually, by semi-automated methods
   using grey level (densitometric) profiles taken from digital images, and
   by automated techniques set at different operating levels. Good
   intra-session repeatibility was obtained using the automated method with
   an operating sigma value of 3 pixels (16 mum) (mean difference 0.5 mum,
   95% CI -8.5 to 9.4 mum) and manual calliper measurements from digitally
   created photographic slides (mean difference 0.4 mum, -9.3 to 10.1 mum).
   For comparison with other measures of width, the latter was used as the
   gold standard. Widths measured from film were slightly larger than those
   measured directly from digital images, although this effect was small (5
   mum) for most vessels. Overall widths measured using the automated
   method, with a sigma value of 3 pixels, agreed best with the gold
   standard (inter-method repeatibility; mean difference 1.4 mum, -32.5 to
   35.2 mum) although the automated method overestimated small widths (<40
   mum) and underestimated larger vessel widths (>40 mum). Automated
   detection of vessels of the conjunctiva from digital images avoids
   manual and operator involved measures which are time consuming, and
   which preclude large patient studies. The resulting data may help in
   monitoring the vascular response of the conjunctiva to surgical or
   pharmacological intervention, and in describing vascular changes in
   response to ocular or systemic disease. The application of this
   algorithm to the study of retinal vessels is yet to be realised.

   from the CALUX assay and the internationally recoganized stanard method
   for determination of dioxin: high resolution gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry(HRGC-MS)showed prfectly positive correlation and well
   repeatibility. The CALUX assay presents less amount-required sample,
   shorter determination cycle and less expense compared with HRGC-MS
   assay. The CALUX assay can be used as a rapid screen assay for
   determination of dioxin in a large number of samples, and will be widely

   method for determining low aflatoxin M, concentration in milk were
   performed in our laboratory. The parameters, such as recovery,
   repeatibility, detection and quantification limit were evaluated to
   carry out this method. Based on spiked samples, the values of recoveries
   ranged from 85.83 to 73.86% at levels of 0.01-0.5 mu g/L, respectively,
   and the relative standard deviation for repeatibility (RSDr) ranged from
   7.73 to 2.08%. The quantification limit established in this method was
   0,02 mu g/L. The results of analysed samples by this method demonstrated
   satisfatory correlation when compared with HPLC. In addition, the AOAC
   method (1975) was also performed, resulting in detection and
   quantification limits of 0.2 and 0.3 mu g/L, respectively, indicating
   low sensibility of this method. Immunoaffinity column cleanup gave
   excellent results for recovery, sensibility and sample throughput.

AB Enrichment of foods with folic acid has turned out to be a common
   practice around the world. Recently, in Brazil, the National Agency for
   Sanitary Surveillance (ANVISA) has brought into public notice a
   resolution on mandatory enrichment of wheat and corn flour with folic
   acid. In the face of this, reliable analytical methodologies for to
   determinate folic acid in flours have to be established and
   standardized. The aim of the present study was to validate a methodology
   for folic acid analyses in enriched wheat and corn flour carried out by
   High Performance Liquid Chromatography. Folic acid was extracted from
   the flours using potassium hydroxide solution and acetonitrile. The
   extract was purified with trichloroacetic acid. For chromatographic
   separation a gradient system composed by acid solution/acetonitrile was
   used as mobile phase, and a C-18 column was employed for vitamin
   separation and elution. Folic acid detection was made at 290nm and its
   quantification was performed by external standardization. The evaluated
   method was efficient being the recovery rates between 92 and 98%; the
   method presented good repeatibility (CV 0.60 to 0.98%), and detection
   and quantification limits were 1.3ng/g and 1.6ng/g, respectively.

   a ten-year period (from 1994 to 2003). The variance component was
   obtained by derivate-free restricted maximum likelihood method. The
   model used contained fixed effects of race, sex, age and origin, and the
   random animal and permanent environmental effects. The repeatibility
   estimates ranged between 0.25 (365 m) and 0.39 (402 m) and the
   heritability ones between 0.01 (320 m) and 0.13 (365 m). This indicates
   that the selection based on animal phenotypic values induce small

   deposition of the mercury film through the polymer layer. The

   mechanical stability, reproducibility, repeatibility and increased
   efficiency against surfactants when comparing to the conventional TMFE.
   Square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry at the ex situ mercury plated
   PSS-TMFE was successfully applied to the determination of total and

   Concentrations in the nanomolar region can be easily assessed using a 3

AB Objective: To establish a method for quantification of Actinobacillus
   actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis from subgingival
   plaque by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique.
   Material and methods: Bacterial cells from both species were obtained
   from type culture and counted microscopically. Cellular suspension in
   sterile destilled water was used for DNA extraction by boiling for 20
   min, with a mineral oil cover. Primers for PCR were selected from
   sequences of LktC gene (A. actinomycetemcomitans) and Arg-gingipain (P.
   gingivalis) to yield amplicons below 100 bp. SYBR Green I based
   real-time PCR was adjusted to quantify separately both species.
   Results: A good sensitivity and specificity were obtained for both
   species, although the yield was better for A. actinomycetemcomitans. A
   good repeatibility of cycle threshold (C-T) was encountered, so
   coefficient of variation was below 6% at every initial copy number.
   Conclusion: A new method of quantification of A. actinomycetemcomitans
   and P. gingivalis based on SYBR Green real-time PCR is presented. Its
   good sensibility and repeatibility will allow its application to
   analysis of subgingival plaque samples.

   visible light. The Fe2+ produced in the photochemical reaction was
   monitored by measuring the absorbance after complexation with ferrozine
   (lambda(max) = 562 nm). The method shows a linear range between 1.0 and
   30 mug mL(-1) (2.5 x 10(-6) - 7.2 x 10(-5) mol L-1) with a limit of
   detection of 0.2 mug mL(-1). Repeatibility was 0.53% expressed as
   relative standard deviation (n = 10), and reproducibility, studied on
   five different days, was +/-1.23%. The sampling frequency was about 45
   samples h(-1) The applicability of the method was tested in the

AB The deposition of a thin film is a dynamic process that is complex and
   subject to unknown disturbances. When the dynamics and final material
   properties are dominated by atomic scale phenomena, it is difficult to
   apply existing optimization and control tools to improve process
   repeatibility and to optimize the resulting material properties.
   Currently, feedback loops are used to control sensed quantities, and
   optimization has been applied to macroscopic reactor conditions like
   fluid flow. Ultimately, one would like to directly control the material
   properties that determine the performance of an integrated circuit or
   MEMS device, even when the property of interest is not directly
   measured. In this paper an integrated control strategy is applied to an
   atomic scale kinetic Monte Carlo simulation of thin film deposition. A
   model reduction approach developed previously for Monte Carlo
   simulations is used in the design of the control strategy. An input
   temperature profile that minimizes interface roughness is computed with
   a gradient optimization, and estimators are designed to infer surface
   roughness from a measurement of the density of steps. A
   proportional-integral feedback controller is then sufficient to control
   surface roughness in the presence of input noise, input offset, and
   uncertainty in the initial surface configuration.

AB Ensuring the safety of marine recreational waters requires accurate
   laboratory detection of fecal indicator organisms such as enterococci.
   Current laboratory methods that employ membrane filtration, such as EPA
   Method 1600, require substantial laboratory processing. An alternative
   method developed by IDEXX(R), Enterolert, a semi-automated most probable
   number (MPN) method, based on Defined Substrate Technology reduces
   processing time. Both methods require 24 h incubation. This study
   compared Enterolert to EPA Method 1600 using samples obtained from
   routinely monitored South Texas recreational bathing areas. Two
   recreational areas at Padre Island National Seashore and two Corpus
   Christi Bay shoreline beaches were sampled for fifteen successive summer
   weeks (4 June 2002-15 September 2002). Duplicate samples were collected
   from three sites per location. Additional sampling was conducted after
   rainfall at one of the two Corpus Christi Bay beaches. For each sample,
   water was analyzed using Method 1600, Enterolert Quanti-Tray(R) and
   Quanti-Tray(R)/2000. EPA procedures and quality control measures were
   followed for Method 1600; while manufacturer's instructions and TNRCC
   Clean River guidelines were used for Enterolert procedures. Enterolert
   Quanti-Trays(R) were read twice (24.5 and 27.5 hr) within the 24-28 hour
   requirement. Data was analyzed to compare reproducibility, repeatibility
   and bias by nested ANOVA and Dunnett's 't' test. The three methods
   yielded significantly different results (P<0.05). Increases in
   fluorescing wells (i.e., reported numbers) were shown between 24.5 and
   27.5 h readings in more than 20% of samples using either Quanti-Tray(R)
   or Quanti-Tray(R)/2000. On a few occasions, sites would only be reported
   as exceeding the EPA criterion of 104 cfu/100ml based on one or two of
   the three analyses. This study demonstrates both advantages and
   disadvantages of using Enterolert versus Method 1600.

   data, we chose six central and peripheral arteries-a. axillaris, a.

   auricularis caudalis. The blood samples were collected from 152 calves
   (2 weeks-6 months old) and 51 dairy cows. The efficiency of collection
   was evaluated with emphasis on minimizing the restraining and stressing
   of the animals, because of the possible effects of the animals'
   responses on blood gases values. In both categories, the results showed
   that the most convenient and reliable sampling sites were a. axillaris
   and a. auricularis caudalis. Both in calves and cows, punctures of a.
   carotis communis and a. caudalis mediana were less successful because of
   more demanding restraint, the stronger responses of the animals, and the
   less repeatibility of the sampling, resp. The least efficiency was
   recorded for the punctures of a. brachialis and a. saphena. Moreover, in
   these punctures, the difficult restraint of calves in the lateral
   position may lead to significant changes in the examined indices.

AB Two methods are described for the determination of theophylline (THP)
   and ephedrine hydrochloride (EPH) in combined pharmaceutical tablet
   forms. The first method depends on the use of the first derivative of
   the ratio-spectra obtained by dividing the absorption spectrum of binary
   mixtures by a standard spectrum of one of the compounds. The first
   derivative amplitudes at 231.8 and 250.3 nm were selected for the assay
   of THP and EPH, respectively. Calibration graphs were established for
   20-180 mug ml(-1) for THP and 10-50 mug ml(-1) for EPH. The second
   method is based on high-performance liquid chromatography on a
   reversed-phase column using a mobile phase of methanol-water (40 +
   60,v/v) (pH 3) with detection at 217 nm. Linearity was obtained in the
   concentration range of 5-150 mug ml(-1) for THP and 15-75 mug ml(-1) for
   EPH. The detection limits for THP and EPH were 0.73 and 0.92 mug ml(-1)
   by ratio-spectra derivative spectrophotometry and 0.59 and 0.86 mug
   ml(-1) by HPLC, respectively. The proposed methods were successfully
   applied to the determination of these drugs in laboratory-prepared
   mixtures and in tablets. The relative standard deviations were found to
   be less than 1.5%, indicating reasonable repeatibility of both methods.

AB Intracellular cytokine production in lymphocytes obtained longitudinally
   from 325 healthy infants aged 2-12 months was compared with adult
   lymphocytes using four-colour flow cytometry. Peripheral blood samples
   (180 microlitres) were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate,
   ionomycin and brefeldin A to induce production and intracellular
   accumulation of cytokines. The method was validated by assessing
   reproducibility, repeatibility, ruggedness (i.e. fresh versus day-old
   blood samples), precision, linearity and sensitivity. Among infants, the
   number and percentage of T lymphocytes (helper/inducer T cell subsets
   and cytotoxic/suppressor T cell subsets) producing IFN-gamma (type 1)
   and IL4 (type 2) increased over the first year of life but remained
   significantly lower than levels found in adults. In both infants and
   adults more CD4(-) T cells than CD4(+) T cells were induced to make
   IFN-gamma. Infant Th1/Th2 ratios revealed modest Th1-skewed
   (predominant) profiles compared to adults, which were 5-10 times higher.
   Infant Tc1/Tc2 ratios revealed Tc1-skewed responses which were equal to
   adult ratios by age 12 months. At 12 months infant Th2 responses were
   closer to adult levels than were Th1 cells. Intracellular cytokine
   detection by flow cytometry is a rapid, sensitive, rugged and precise
   method to characterize immune status changes over time.

AB A rapid high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the
   determination of organic acids in honey is reported. Malic, maleic,
   citric, succinic and fumaric acids were identified and quantified in 15
   min. First time repeatibility, reproducibility and recoveries were
   determined out for these acids in honey samples. Maleic acid was also
   quantified for first time by a chromatographic method. The organic acids
   were removed from honey by using a solid-phase extraction procedure with
   anion-exchange cartridges. Previously, the solution of honey was
   adjusted to pH 10.50 with 0.1 M NaOH and stirred for 15 min at room
   temperature. Then, this solution was adjusted to pH 5.00 with 0.1 M
   H2SO4. This procedure was carried out to avoid interferences in the
   baseline. The chromatographic separation was achieved with only one
   Spherisorb ODS-2 S5 column thermostated at 25 degreesC. Metaphosphoric
   acid (pH 2.20) was used as mobile phase at a flow-rate of 0.7 ml/min.
   Organic acids were detected with a UV-vis detector (215 mu.). The
   precision results showed that the relative standard deviations of the
   repeatability and reproducibility were less than or equal to3.20% and
   less than or equal to4.86%, respectively. The recoveries of the organic
   acids ranged from 62.9 to 99.4%. Under optimum conditions the detection
   limits ranged from 0.0064 to 7.57 mg/kg and the quantification limits
   ranged from 0.025 to 10.93 mg/kg. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

   as binder and anti-caking agents in feedstuffs, such as kaolin,

   PCDDs/PCDFs found in a preliminary evaluation and the absence of
   reference materials highlighted further research needed. Therefore, an
   extensive study on the analytical procedures based on the classical
   methods was performed with sepiolite samples. The study includes
   evaluation of reproducibility and repeatibility. To this end, a series
   of intra-day and nine inter-day analysis were made. The methodolgy was
   also assessed against the sample size and series of 12.5, 25, 37.5 and
   50 g were analyzed. In all cases, the results confirmed good correlation

AB Summary form only given. This paper presents the corrosion properties of
   RF inductively coupled plasma nitrided stainless steel substrates. A
   home-made low-frequency RF inductively coupled plasma source was used to
   perform the nitriding process. The processing parameters were carefully
   selected after considering the repeatability of the device. A nitrogen
   plasma operating in the H-mode was used for the nitriding process.
   Proper substrate bias was also applied during nitriding. Several
   stainless steel substrates were nitrided at different processing times.
   Investigations such as microhardness, XRD and EDAX tests were performed
   on the nitrided samples prior to corrosion testing. For corrosion
   testing, the electrochemical polarization method was used. In this
   method, the corrosion resistance properties were successfully
   characterized. Several results are presented in this paper to reveal the
   correlation of the nitriding times, the phases formed and surface
   hardness to the corrosion properties of the samples.

AB Analysis of long-term surface electromyographic (SEMG) signals has many
   applications in ergonomics when related to muscle fatigue. The present
   work proposes a set of processing methods reporting SEMG modifications
   during longterm driving tests in various situations (with or without
   head rest). A segmentation/classification algorithm allows signal
   splitting into homogeneous parts (postural activity and EMG bursts) and
   an efficient artefact suppression. Postural activity modifications are
   evaluated from time-varying amplitude probability density function
   (TAPDF) parameters. EMG burst analysis is achieved taking into account
   the relationships of these bursts with accelerometric events. This
   segmentation/classification procedure improves repeatability but does
   not significantly modify the overall results obtained before
   segmentation, as far as the analysis of head rest influence is
   concerned.

AB Preoperative planning of total hip replacement is currently performed by
   the surgeons superimposing the implant templates printed on a
   translucent sheet on the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral X-ray
   projections of the patient femur. Due to the sources of error affecting
   this method, when the combined femoral neck anteversion and external
   rotation is greater then 15 degrees, a CT-based method of preoperative
   planning is recommended. This paper describes a CT-based preoperative
   planning system for total hip replacement: HIPOP. The system presents
   some innovative aspects on the user interface combining 2D and 3D
   representations of the patient anatomy and the prosthesis enhancing
   usability and friendliness. Moreover a set of quantitative fit and fill
   indicators has been develop to support the surgeon in his planning
   activity. Preliminary results on the surgeon learning time and
   repeatibility of the planning activity show that a surgeon with a basic
   computer knowledge can conclude his first planning session in 10 to 15
   minutes. The surgeon planning repeatibility has shown to be rather high:
   about 1mm of variability in the position of the stem in the transaxial
   plane, and about 1 degrees variability on the stem orientation. Lower
   repeatibility has been found in the position of the prosthetic stem
   along the z direction. Further investigations need to be carried out to
   clarify this aspect.

   An angular-position transducer is used to indicate the number of turns
   of a dram as a plump line wound on the drum, is unwound until a weight
   (of gramble solids) or afloat (for fluids) touch the surface. When this
   occours the plump line loses tension, a tension sensor (force
   transducer) detects the loss in tension and sends signal to a
   direction-changing device, that controls a drum drive motor. Beyond the
   question of point or continous level control, operating variable play a
   major role in determing accuracy and repeatibility requirements. The
   paper contains the dynamic analysis and the identification of the sensor

AB The application of the ratio spectra derivative spectrophotometry and
   high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to the simultaneous
   determination of paracetamol (PAR) and methocarbamol (MET) in combined
   pharmaceutical tablets is presented. The spectrophotometric procedure is
   based on the use of the first derivative of the ratio spectra obtained
   by dividing the absorbtion spectrum of the binary mixtures by a standard
   spectrum of one of the compounds. The first derivative amplitudes were
   measured at 243.0 and 230.3 nm for the assay of PAR and MET,
   respectively. Calibration graphs were established for 2-30 mug/ml for
   PAR and 2-36 mug/ml for MET in binary mixture. The detection limits for
   PAR and MET were found 0.097 and 0.079 mug/ml, respectively; while the
   quantification limits were 0.573 mug/ml for PAR and 1.717 mug/ml for
   MET. For the HPLC procedure, a reversed-phase column with a mobile phase
   of methanol-water (60.40, v/v), was used to separate both compounds with
   a detection of 274.0 nm. Linearity was obtained in the concentration
   range of 2-300 and 1.5-375 mug/ml for PAR and MET, respectively. The
   detection and quantification limits were found to be 0.42 and 1.4 mug/ml
   for PAR and 0.36 and 1.2 mug/ml for MET, respectively. The relative
   standard deviations were found to be less than 0.52%. indicating
   reasonable repeatibility of both methods. The proposed methods were
   successfully applied to the determination of these drugs in commercial
   tablets. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The use in clinical situations of a near real-time prototype
   opto-electronic dynamic 3D surface sensor has been investigated.
   Variations within optical sensor system height-maps show that noise
   amounts to 100 microns on snapshots of smooth body surfaces. It is not
   increased by image processing software removing triangulation spot
   artefacts. Presence of hairs on a body surface degrades the image
   quality, but still within tolerance (800 microns, typically the size of
   in-slice CT pixel). The accuracy of the system is 150 microns, the
   repeatibility 300 microns; `off-surface' points should however be
   masked. Feasibility of dynamic 3D imaging of a body surface is
   demonstrated. Visualisation and analysis of the entire chest surface
   movement during breathing is achieved using the optical sensor system.
   Such monitoring and quantification of patient movement is directly
   relevant to gated radiotherapy and post-treatment verifications.
   Analysis of surface movement (height variations over time) in terms of
   mean and standard deviation should also be included in patient set-up
   procedures before radiotherapy treatment.

AB The repeatibility of raceme characters of acai palm ( Euterpe oleracea)
   was studied in Parana, Brazil. Weight of raceme, weight of fruits per
   raceme, number of fruits per raceme, number of rachilles per raceme,
   average weight of fruit, and revenue of fruits per raceme were evaluated
   for mature racemes from 30 genotypes. All the characters differed
   significantly between genotypes. The largest repeatibility and
   determination coefficients were found for average fruit weight. It is
   concluded that this character could be used as a selection parameter in
   less rigorous improvement methods.

AB Objective. To assess whether first tarsometatarsal joint stiffness can
   be measured by Doppler imaging of vibrations and if so, to assess
   reference values.
   Design. Repeated in vivo Doppler imaging of vibrations measurements at
   the first tarsometatarsal joint in healthy persons.
   Background. Clinical hypermobility of the first tarsometatarsal joint is
   an important factor in a hallux valgus deformity. No objective and
   non-invasive test is available to quantify first tarsometatarsal joint
   mobility. Doppler imaging of vibrations, a technique recently developed
   to measure joint stiffness, might be an effective tool to quantify
   stiffness of this joint.
   Methods. Vibrations were applied to the head of the first metatarsal in
   46 feet of 23 healthy subjects and picked up by a transducer at both
   sides of the first tarsometatarsal joint. A pilot study was performed on
   three patients with hypermobility of the first tarsometatarsal joint.
   Measurements are expressed in threshold units related to colour Doppler
   imaging.
   Results. The values of the threshold units were found to be very similar
   in healthy persons, with a good repeatibility; 95% of the healthy
   persons had a threshold unit below 3.4. No significant difference was
   found between the left and right foot, or between male and female
   subjects. Also there was no significant correlation with age or weight
   of the subjects. In the three patients with first tarsometatarsal
   hypermobility we found threshold units above 5.
   Conclusions. With Doppler imaging of vibrations first tarsometatarsal
   joint stiffness can be measured in healthy persons in a noninvasive and
   objective way. In a pilot study, three patients with first
   tarsometatarsal hypermobility showed lower stiffness values than the
   healthy subjects.

AB Simultaneous multiple adjustment factors for parity-age-season of
   calving on milk yield of the cow were estimated by means of REML using
   77,360 lactations of Holstein cows breed that calving from 1987 to 1992
   in herds from South and Southeast regions of Brazil. Seventeen-cow ages
   at calving groups were allotted to four season classes and three parity
   classes. The multiple adjustment factors were obtained from the ratio
   between the estimative of average milk yield of cows that calving from
   73 to 78 month of age, after the second calving parity, during the
   months of April to June, and the estimative of the average milk yield
   for the lactations initiated by cows that calving in each subclass group
   of parity-age-season of calving. The average milk yield was 6,054 kg
   with standard deviation of 2,053 kg. The estimated repeatibility was
   0.43 for the total milk yield. In subsequent stage, the use of estimates
   the multiple adjustment factors simultaneously for the fixed effects of
   parity-age-season of calving previously in the data was compared with
   the resultant analyses from a model that included these fixed effects.
   The results indicated large necessity of the adjustment of the milk
   yield for parity-age-season of calving for young cows, calving during
   the months from October to March in the first calving parity. The total
   milk production adjusted for adult age was used to classify the herds
   among three phenotypic classes of standard deviation, low, average and
   high. The heritability estimates obtained using no adjusted and adjusted
   data for the fixed effects of season of calving and cow age at calving,
   were closely in all classes of phenotypic standard deviation.

AB A specific leptin RIA was developed to assess concentrations of leptin
   in ovine plasma, and was shown to be efficient with bovine and caprine
   plasma. A specific, high-affinity antibody was generated against
   recombinant ovine leptin which, when used in a competitive leptin RIA,
   provided valid estimates of linearity (r=+0.989-0.998), recovery (102%),
   repeatability (13%) and limit of sensitivity (0.83 ng/ml for 100 mu l
   sample size). Serial dilutions of five ovine, bovine or caprine plasma
   samples showed good linearity and parallelism with the recombinant ovine
   leptin standard curve. A comparison of this RIA was made with a
   commercial 'multi-species' RIA kit using 56 ovine plasma samples. Major
   differences were found in assay sensitivity. Non-lactating,
   non-pregnant, ovariectomized ewes were fed a ration for 65 days which
   provided 90 +/- 9% (control; n=12) or 39 +/- 2% of maintenance energy
   requirements (underfed; n=16) in order to analyse the respective effects
   of body fatness (estimated by either an in vivo dilution technique or
   body condition scoring) and of nutritional status on plasma leptin
   concentration. There was a significant positive correlation between body
   fatness or body condition score and plasma leptin levels (r=+0.68,
   P<0.001 or r=+0.72, P<0.001 respectively). When concentrations of leptin
   were assessed over time, underfed ewes exhibited a dramatic reduction in
   plasma leptin values (- 56%, P<0.001). These data provide strong
   evidence that, in sheep, the variations in plasma concentrations of
   leptin are related to variations in body fatness (35%) and, to a lesser
   extent, in nutritional status (17%).

AB A simple and novel screening method for lead compounds in environmental

   C-60 fullerene column as diethyldithiocarbamate complexes and
   subsequently eluted with isobutyl methyl ketone (IBMK), the lead being
   determined by dame atomic absorption spectrometry. The screening method
   acts as filter and indicates whether the target analytes are present
   above or below the detection limit of the method (0.5 ng/mL), giving no
   false positives. Positive samples were speciated by GC/MS, using a flow
   system similar to that of the screening method. Lead(II) and ionic di-
   and trialkyllead are derivatized with a Grignard reagent. Both methods
   use similar chemical and flow variables except for the eluent, IBMK in
   the screening method and n-hexane in the speciation method. The GC/ MS
   speciation method is very sensitive; it exhibits a linear range of
   0.02-5 ng/mL, and detection limits of 1-4 ng/L are achieved. Also, its
   repeatibility, as RSD, is less than 6%. The method was applied to the
   speciation of Ph2+ and di- and trialkyllead in positive prescreened
   rainwater samples from three different urban areas.

PY 2000
AB Background: We examined the most widely used echo-Doppler variables in
   healthy adults to define their normal distribution and variability in
   relation to age, sex, body surface area and the right and left kidney.
   Methods: Ninety healthy subjects were selected, stratified for sex and
   age (range 20-65 years). We also examined 8 subjects with a congenital
   solitary kidney and 15 surgically nephrectomized patients. Variables
   studied were the diameters and volume of the kidneys, renal blood flow
   (RBF) and resistive index (RI) measured on the renal, interlobar and
   cortical arteries.
   Results: The mean length was greater in the left kidney (p < 0.01) and
   width in the right one (p < 0.02). Volume was no different on the two
   sides. RBF showed an age-dependent reduction (p < 0.0001), while
   interlobar (p < 0.0001) and cortical (p < 0.0001) RI showed a selective
   age-dependent increase. RT were higher in females and diameters, volume
   and RBF, after correction for body surface area, were not different in
   the two sexes. Cortical RI was lower than the interlobar and renal RI (p
   < 0.0001). In the group with congenital single kidney, length, volume
   and RBF were all greater In the mononephrectomized patients, length and
   volume were greater but RBF was the same as in a normal single kidney.
   Conclusions: The ultrasonogaphic and Doppler variables studied did not
   show any differences from normal distribution but they were influenced
   differently by some demographic parameters; however, the integrated use
   of these measurements offers precision and repeatibility, and could help
   evaluating diffuse or localized abnormalities.

   evaluation that involve metal cutting operations under controlled

   and cost is carried out, based on results from comprehensive
   experimental investigations in turning, drilling, milling, reaming, and
   tapping. Different workpiece materials, such as carbon steels, stainless
   steels, and aluminium alloys, as well as different kinds of cutting
   fluids, including water based products, straight mineral oils, and
   vegetable oil based formulations, are considered. The analysis is
   carried out grouping the tests according to the main measurand: tool
   life, cutting forces, and workpiece surface finish. The ratio sigma/rho,
   where sigma is the standard deviation of measurements and rho the range
   of variability of test results, was introduced to express the relative
   resolution of a test, and a cost model was developed. It was concluded
   from the analysis that tool life tests are connected with limited
   repeatibility (sigma=10-50%) and resolution (sigma/rho ranging from
   0.25-0.75), with costs ranging from 1000 Euro to 2000 Euro. Tests based
   on cutting forces are connected with a much better repeatibility and
   resolution, featuring values for sigma in the range 0.5-6% and a
   sigma/rho ratio of approximately 0.2, with test costs of about 500 Euro.
   Surface finish tests feature repeatabilities of approximately 50% and
   resolutions of 0.3-0.4, with costs of approximately 1000 Euro.

AB In this paper, the authors propose and analyse a non-invasive
   measurement procedure for the diagnosis of structural defects on human
   teeth based on non-contact excitation and measurement of vibration by
   laser techniques. The tooth is excited in vibration by Nd:YAG laser
   pulses, below the ablation threshold, which induces local thermal
   expansion with consequent propagation of bending waves. Vibrations are
   then measured by Laser Doppler Vibrometry (LDV), which permits
   non-invasive and accurate measurements. The presence of structural
   defects, caused, for example, by caries, can be detected by variation in
   the dynamic behaviour of the tooth. The technique and the results of
   in-vitro tests on artificially defected human teeth are presented. The
   metrological problems connected with measurement repeatibility in
   different operating conditions are addressed. The effect of pulse energy
   level has also been measured, with the aim of determining the minimum
   energy level sufficient to achieve satisfactory signal-to-noise ratio in
   vibration measurement. In fact, if high-energy pulses are utilised,
   overheating or ablation on the tooth structure may be caused with
   serious consequences for the patient. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All
