AB John Dalton's atomic theory, with its postulate of compound formation
   through atom-to-atom combination, brought a new perspective to weight
   relationships in chemical reactions. A presumed one-to-one combination
   of atoms A and B to form a simple compound AB allowed Dalton to
   construct his first table of relative atomic weights from literature
   analyses of appropriate binary compounds. For such simple binary
   compounds, the atomic theory had little advantages over affinity theory
   as an explanation of fixed proportions by weight. For ternary compounds
   of the form AB(2), however, atomic theory made quantitative predictions
   that were not deducible from affinity theory. Atomic theory required
   that the weight of B in the compound AB(2) be exactly twice that in the
   compound AB. Dalton, Thomas Thomson and William Hyde Wollaston all
   published within a few years of each other experimental data that
   claimed to give the predicted results with the required accuracy. There
   are nonetheless several experimental barriers to obtaining the desired
   integral multiple proportions. In this paper I will discuss replication
   experiments which demonstrate that only Wollaston's results are
   experimentally reliable. It is likely that such replicability explains
   why Wollaston's experiments were so influential.

AB The Solark I Prototype was Southeast University's proposal for Solar
   Decathlon China 2013. This paper presents the prototype's passive
   strategies, active systems and performance results. The limitations,
   future perspectives and potential for replicability and transposition of
   Solark I are also discussed. Through a whole-building design process,
   Solark I effectively integrates all aspects of weather data analysis,
   building design, building envelope design, photovoltaic system design,
   solar hot water system design and heating, ventilating, and air
   conditioning system design to minimize energy consumption and
   environmental impacts. Solark I achieved an excellent balance between
   passive strategies and highly efficient active systems. These design
   decisions help Solark I to maintain its hydrothermal comfort and perform
   all regular tasks with minimum energy consumption. This low energy
   consumption allows Solark I to obtain a positive energy balance both in
   annual energy simulations and on-site during the monitored period.

AB Background: The importance of medical education research in Saudi Arabia
   has been acknowledged increasingly and a lot of concepts used have been
   derived from the Western world. The question arises, however, whether
   Western concepts and questionnaires are transferable to societies with
   different cultures. The aim of this study was to investigate the
   instrument structure and the reliability of the Arabic version of the
   Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire-medium ( ZKPQ-m).
   Methods: Three statistical methods with decreased amount of strictness
   were used to analyse our data: Confirmatory Factor Analysis, Procrustes
   rotation and Principal Component Analysis.
   Results: Our outcomes did not confirm the original instrument structure.
   Instead, we found four interpretable components: Emotional Instability,
   Impulse-seeking, Activeness and Self-Control. However, the amount of
   explained variance was not very high and the internal consistencies
   ranged from unsatisfactory to only moderate. The data showed a high
   percentage of respondents agreeing with more than three items of the
   Infrequency scale, which may be attributable to the collectivistic
   culture in Saudi Arabia.
   Conclusion: We did not succeed in replicating the ZKPQ structure in the
   Arabic context. Social desirability, a common characteristic in
   collectivistic cultures, may have reduced the replicability of the
   internal structure of the ZKPQ-m. Different methods to measure concepts
   in collectivistic cultures may help to get round social desirability.

AB Human height is associated with risk of multiple diseases and is
   profoundly determined by an individual's genetic makeup and shows a high
   degree of ethnic heterogeneity. Large-scale genome-wide association
   (GWA) analyses of adult height in Europeans have identified nearly 180
   genetic loci. A recent study showed high replicability of results from
   Europeans-based GWA studies in Asians; however, population-specific loci
   may exist due to distinct linkage disequilibrium patterns. We carried
   out a GWA meta-analysis in 93 926 individuals from East Asia. We
   identified 98 loci, including 17 novel and 81 previously reported loci,
   associated with height at P<5x10(-8), together explaining 8.89% of
   phenotypic variance. Among the newly identified variants, 10 are
   commonly distributed (minor allele frequency, MAF > 5%) in Europeans,
   with comparable frequencies with in Asians, and 7single-nucleotide
   polymorphisms are with low frequency (MAF <5%) in Europeans. In
   addition, our data suggest that novel biological pathway such as the
   protein tyrosine phosphatase family is involved in regulation of height.
   The findings from this study considerably expand our knowledge of the
   genetic architecture of human height in Asians.

AB In a recent article, Cumming (2014) called for two major changes to how
   psychologists conduct research. The first suggested change encouraging
   transparency and replication is clearly worthwhile, but we question the
   wisdom of the second suggested change: abandoning p-values in favor of
   reporting confidence intervals (CIs) only in all psychological research
   reports. This article has three goals. First, we correct the false
   impression created by Cumming that the debate about the usefulness of
   NHST has been won by its critics. Second, we take issue with the implied
   connection between the use of NHST and the current crisis of
   replicability in psychology. Third, while we agree with other critics of
   Cumming (2014) that hypothesis testing is an important part of science
   (Morey et al., 2014), we express skepticism that alternative hypothesis
   testing frameworks, such as Bayes factors, are a solution to the
   replicability crisis. Poor methodological practices can compromise the
   validity of Bayesian and classic statistical analyses alike. When it
   comes to choosing between competing statistical approaches, we highlight
   the value of applying the same standards of evidence that psychologists
   demand in choosing between competing substantive hypotheses.

AB Numerous recommendations for improving the dependability of research
   findings in psychological science have emerged in recent years.
   Unfortunately, this glut of recommendations proves problematic for
   advancing uniform solutions to improve research dependability by
   individuals within and across the various constituencies that comprise
   psychological science. Moreover, several dependability recommendations
   propose practices to address the problem of false positive findings that
   can inversely increase the problem of false negative findings, and vice
   versa. It is proposed that the solution to this conundrum is to develop
   a concise and concrete list of core research dependability
   recommendations that address problems of false positive and false
   negative findings in a noncontradicting manner. Examination of the
   current research dependability literature and earlier literatures
   dealing with the problem of false findings is used to arrive at a set of
   three core research dependability recommendations: (a) conduct and
   promote direct replication studies; (b) ensure data sharing when
   requested by fellow scientists; and (c) adopt and promote a truth
   seeking mindset during the research endeavor.

AB A central feature of HIV-1 infection is the inability of entering virus
   to integrate into chromosomes of resting T lymphocytes unless they are
   mitogenically activated. In contrast, SIVpbj1.9 replicates in initially
   resting T lymphocytes by activating infected cells. Previous reports
   have shown that a difference in Nef-mediated T cell activation between
   HIV-1 and SIVpbj1.9 plays a critical role in the differing abilities of
   these viruses to replicate in resting lymphocytes. However, the
   molecular details of these differences are still unclear. Here, we show
   that infection with a chimeric virus, HSIVnef, which harbors the 5' 308
   nucleotides of SIVpbj1.9 nef in place of the 5' 221 nucleotides of HIV-1
   nef in the HIV-1 proviral backbone, resulted in integration of the
   provirus into host chromosomes without mitogenic activation and thereby
   replication in resting human PBMCs (hPBMCs). These results indicate that
   Nef is an essential viral determinant for the integration of provirus
   into host chromosomes in resting T cells. Using the yeast two-hybrid
   system, we identified integrase interactor-1 (INI1/SMARCB1) as a
   cellular factor that is involved in the integration process via
   interaction with Nef. Although INI1 interacted with both SIVpbj1.9 and
   HIV-1 Nefs, SIVpbj1.9 Nef, but not HIV-1 Nef, enhanced proviral
   integration into host DNA. Furthermore, mutational analysis revealed
   that the basic-amino-acid-rich amino-terminal domain in SIVpbj1.9 Nef is
   crucial for interaction with INI1 and virus replication in resting
   hPBMCs. Taken together, these data indicate that Nef is a critical viral
   protein for incorporating nascent proviral DNA into host chromosomes in
   resting PBMCs and that this occurs through interaction with INI1. This
   elucidates the basis for replication of the integrated provirus when the
   host cell is in a resting state.

AB Scientists in the Netherlands are cultivating edible insects to address
   concerns of international food security. Committed to the One World, One
   Health (OWOH) movement, their research aims to create a safe and
   effective global solution to the conjoined problems of climate change
   and an increasing worldwide demand for protein. Their preliminary work
   is promising, as it suggests that when compared to other sources of
   meat, insects can be an efficient, safe, and low-impact source of
   nutrients. Additionally, in many sites with endemic malnutrition, people
   find insects tasty. The problem these scientists are grappling with,
   however, is that insects that are easily mass-produced are not the
   insects people typically want to eat. This paper shows how the
   contingency of edibility complicates existing scientific models of
   travel that posit that singular objects spread peripherally outwards
   from a center into a globally connected, singular world. The scientists
   are finding that the production of successful food products necessitates
   that insects be constantly tinkered with: there is no "insect" that can
   be globally edible since "the global" itself is not a singular entity.
   This in turn complicates the vision of replicability and "scaling up"
   inherent in an OWOH vision of science. The researchers' process of
   moving their goods from the laboratory boxes they work with into the
   mealtime practices they seek to impact is compelling them to cultivate
   and articulate new ideals for research, methods of translation, and
   pathways by which goods can travel. They are finding that if they want
   to affect the health of "the world," they must engage with many
   different worlds.

AB Background: Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) are neurodevelopmental
   conditions characterized by difficulties in communication and social
   interaction, alongside unusually repetitive behaviours and narrow
   interests. Asperger Syndrome (AS) is one subgroup of ASC and differs
   from classic autism in that in AS there is no language or general
   cognitive delay. Genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors are
   implicated in ASC and genes involved in neural connectivity and
   neurodevelopment are good candidates for studying the susceptibility to
   ASC. The aryl-hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator 2 (ARNT2) gene
   encodes a transcription factor involved in neurodevelopmental processes,
   neuronal connectivity and cellular responses to hypoxia. A mutation in
   this gene has been identified in individuals with ASC and single
   nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been nominally associated with AS
   and autistic traits in previous studies.
   Methods: In this study, we tested 34 SNPs in ARNT2 for association with
   AS in 118 cases and 412 controls of Caucasian origin. P values were
   adjusted for multiple comparisons, and linkage disequilibrium (LD) among
   the SNPs analysed was calculated in our sample. Finally, SNP annotation
   allowed functional and structural analyses of the genetic variants in
   ARNT2. We tested the replicability of our result using the genome-wide
   association studies (GWAS) database of the Psychiatric Genomics
   Consortium (PGC).
   Results: We report statistically significant association of rs17225178
   with AS. This SNP modifies transcription factor binding sites and
   regions that regulate the chromatin state in neural cell lines. It is
   also included in a LD block in our sample, alongside other genetic
   variants that alter chromatin regulatory regions in neural cells.
   Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that rs17225178 in the ARNT2
   gene is associated with AS and support previous studies that pointed out
   an involvement of this gene in the predisposition to ASC.

AB Background: This investigation aimed to develop a screening tool based
   on the Cognitive Inventory of Subjective Distress (CISD). Two studies
   were designed in order to test the second-order factorial structure of
   the CISD, to shorten its length and to assess its replicability on a
   second large independent sample.
   Methods: We recruited a first sample (n = 290) living at home or in
   retirement centers and a second community-based sample (n = 1,429). The
   first sample completed the original CISD as well as cognitive, autonomy,
   anxiety, and depression assessments. The second sample completed the
   Short-CISD (S-CISD).
   Results: Factor analyses supported a second-order factorial structure
   allowing to engage in a refinement of the scale. We retained seven items
   corresponding to a dimension of cognitive schemas. Confirmatory Factor
   Analysis (CFA) demonstrated that the S-CISD exhibited satisfying
   psychometric properties as well as factorial replicability and
   structural invariance in two different samples. Further, the internal
   consistency of the S-CISD is acceptable.
   Conclusion: The S-CISD is a relevant screening tool for rapidly
   assessing psychological distress. It is directed towards old and very
   old individuals either living at home or in a retirement center, while
   also taking into account the fatigability and potential cognitive
   impairment of this population. This screening tool can be confidently
   used for psychopathological assessment and can serve as a baseline for
   following patients over time or in the course of therapy.

AB Objective: The authors sought to demonstrate that schizophrenia is a
   heterogeneous group of heritable disorders caused by different genotypic
   networks that cause distinct clinical syndromes.
   Method: In a large genome-wide association study of cases with
   schizophrenia and controls, the authors first identified sets of
   interacting single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that cluster within
   particular individuals (SNP sets) regardless of clinical status. Second,
   they examined the risk of schizophrenia for each SNP set and tested
   replicability in two independent samples. Third, they identified
   genotypic networks composed of SNP sets sharing SNPs or subjects.
   Fourth, they identified sets of distinct clinical features that cluster
   in particular cases (phenotypic sets or clinical syndromes) without
   regard for their genetic background. Fifth, they tested whether SNP sets
   were associated with distinct phenotypic sets in a replicable manner
   across the three studies.
   Results: The authors identified 42 SNP sets associated with a 70% or
   greater risk of schizophrenia, and confirmed 34 (81%) or more with
   similar high risk of schizophrenia in two independent samples. Seventeen
   networks of SNP sets did not share any SNP or subject. These disjoint
   genotypic networks were associated with distinct gene products and
   clinical syndromes (i.e., the schizophrenias) varying in symptoms and
   severity. Associations between genotypic networks and clinical syndromes
   were complex, showing multifinality and equifinality. The interactive
   networks explained the risk of schizophrenia more than the average
   effects of all SNPs (24%).
   Conclusions: Schizophrenia is a group of heritable disorders caused by a
   moderate number of separate genotypic networks associated with several
   distinct clinical syndromes.

AB Introduction: The Childhood Obesity Research Demonstration (CORD)
   project links public health and primary care interventions in three
   projects described in detail in accompanying articles in this issue of
   Childhood Obesity. This article describes a comprehensive evaluation
   plan to determine the extent to which the CORD model is associated with
   changes in behavior, body weight, BMI, quality of life, and healthcare
   satisfaction in children 2-12 years of age.
   Design/Methods: The CORD Evaluation Center (EC-CORD) will analyze the
   pooled data from three independent demonstration projects that each
   integrate public health and primary care childhood obesity
   interventions. An extensive set of common measures at the family,
   facility, and community levels were defined by consensus among the CORD
   projects and EC-CORD. Process evaluation will assess reach, dose
   delivered, and fidelity of intervention components. Impact evaluation
   will use a mixed linear models approach to account for heterogeneity
   among project-site populations and interventions. Sustainability
   evaluation will assess the potential for replicability, continuation of
   benefits beyond the funding period, institutionalization of the
   intervention activities, and community capacity to support ongoing
   program delivery. Finally, cost analyses will assess how much benefit
   can potentially be gained per dollar invested in programs based on the
   CORD model.
   Conclusions: The keys to combining and analyzing data across multiple
   projects include the CORD model framework and common measures for the
   behavioral and health outcomes along with important covariates at the
   individual, setting, and community levels. The overall objective of the
   comprehensive evaluation will develop evidence-based recommendations for
   replicating and disseminating community-wide, integrated public health
   and primary care programs based on the CORD model.

AB Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating mutations are a
   predictor of tyrosine kinase inhibitor effectiveness in the treatment of
   non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The objective of this study is to
   build a model for predicting the EGFR mutation status of brain
   metastasis in patients with NSCLC.
   Observation and model set-up.
   This study was conducted between January 2003 and December 2011 in 6
   medical centers in Southwest China.
   The study included 31 NSCLC patients with brain metastases.
   Eligibility requirements were histological proof of NSCLC, as well as
   sufficient quantity of paraffin-embedded lung and brain metastases
   specimens for EGFR mutation detection. The linear discriminant analysis
   (LDA) method was used for analyzing the dimensional reduction of
   clinical features, and a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was
   employed to generate an EGFR mutation model for NSCLC brain metastases.
   Training-testing-validation (3 : 1 : 1) processes were applied to find
   the best fit in 12 patients (validation test set) with NSCLC and brain
   metastases treated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and whole-brain
   radiotherapy.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures: EGFR mutation analysis in
   patients with NSCLC and brain metastases and the development of a
   LDA-SVM-based EGFR mutation model for NSCLC brain metastases patients.
   EGFR mutation discordance between the primary lung tumor and brain
   metastases was found in 5 patients. Using LDA, 13 clinical features were
   transformed into 9 characteristics, and 3 were selected as primary
   vectors. The EGFR mutation model constructed with SVM algorithms had an
   accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for determining the mutation
   status of brain metastases of 0.879, 0.886, and 0.875, respectively.
   Furthermore, the replicability of our model was confirmed by testing 100
   random combinations of input values.
   The LDA-SVM-based model developed in this study could predict the EGFR
   status of brain metastases in this small cohort of patients with NSCLC.
   Further studies with larger cohorts should be carried out to validate
   our findings in the clinical setting.

AB H9N2 avian influenza viruses are enzootic around the world and can
   infect many different avian and mammalian hosts, including humans.
   Unlike the H9N2 viruses, which mainly originated in other countries and
   possess a non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of 230 aa, 98 % of the H9N2
   viruses isolated in China lack the 13 aa at the C terminus of NS1 (217
   aa in total). The biological significance of NS1 elongation remains
   elusive. To examine the effect of NS1 C-terminal elongation in the
   influenza virus, we used reverse genetics to generate a wt avian
   influenza H9N2 virus containing a 217 aa NS1 (H9N2NS1217) and two mutant
   viruses with elongated NS1s of 230 and 237 aa (H9N2NS1230 and
   H9N2NS1237). C-terminal elongation of NS1 did not have a significant
   impact on virus replication in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells or DF-1
   cells. The three variants exhibited similar replicability in mice;
   however, the H9N2NS1230 and H9N2NS1237 variants exhibited an
   upregulation in the level of inflammatory cytokines. In addition, both
   the H9N2NS1230 and H9N2NS1237 viruses increased replication and induced
   a high level of inflammatory cytokines and transmission in chickens,
   compared with the wt virus. These findings suggest that the NS1
   extension conferred a gain of fitness to some extent.

AB In this article, we report on an attempt to replicate findings with
   social axioms. Participants from 33 countries (total N = 7,825) were
   given a 30-item questionnaire based on the work of Leung et al. Several
   different methods of factor analysis were used, and individual-level as
   well as the aggregated (nation-level) data were examined. The
   five-factor structure of social axioms did replicate at the individual
   level. At the country and world regions level of analysis, however, our
   findings differ from what has been reported previously. As before, the
   most pronounced arithmetic mean differences were obtained on
   Religiosity, with South East Asian region and Malaysia in particular
   scoring high and Western Europe, especially Spain, being low. Even
   though cross-cultural differences in Social Complexity were not
   pronounced, they are comparable in size with what has been reported for
   social attitudes. Differences between world regions on Social Cynicism,
   Fate Control, and Reward for Application were in-between those for
   Religiosity and Social Complexity. These results indicate that social
   axioms are useful constructs for cross-cultural comparisons.

AB The purpose of the present study was to examine the factor structure and
   assess the reliability of the Chinese Conformity to Masculine Norms
   Inventory-46 (CCMNI-46). Using a cohort of 254 Hong Kong-born Chinese
   males, scale reliability determination involved the internal
   consistencies of the entire instrument. Ages of respondents ranged from
   18 to 81years (M = 38.05; SD = 17.3). Confirmatory factor analysis
   provided support for the psychometric properties of the CCMNI-46, thus
   confirming the multidimensional structure of the CMNI-46 and the
   replicability of the CMNI using a Hong Kong Chinese sample. All items
   loaded onto the corresponding factor with the exception of one item from
   the emotional control subscale. The overall reliability of the CCMNI-46
   was lower than previous Western studies and may well reflect the subtle
   diversity of masculinity across cultures. The findings offered
   psychometric support for use of the CCMNI-46 in research and practice
   regarding Hong Kong Chinese masculinity. The CCMNI-46 provides a useful
   template for the operationalization of masculine norms in Chinese
   society.

AB There is increasing awareness of the interplay among sleep, circadian
   rhythms, and psychopathology. Recent findings show that
   obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is associated with late bedtimes.
   Sleep disruption may exacerbate impairments in executive functioning in
   individuals with OCD, making these individuals vulnerable to
   experiencing intrusive thoughts that come from "out of the blue"
   (autogenous obsessions; AO) and to having difficulty dismissing them.
   The current study investigated types of intrusive thoughts experienced
   by individuals with (DB) and without (NDB) delayed bedtimes. Bedtime,
   and AO (uncued, affectively negative) vs. reactive obsessions (RO;
   triggered by environment, affectively neutral) were examined in 212
   adults. As hypothesized, individuals with DB reported more frequent
   intrusive thoughts, as well as more AO, than NDB individuals.
   Additionally, DB participants reported a greater urge to neutralize
   intrusive thoughts than NDB participants. Future work should test the
   replicability of these findings and explore circadian disruptions in OCD
   using biological markers.

AB When coding events from media sources - as the majority of data projects
   do - different reports may oftentimes contain contradictory information.
   What do coders make of this? It is up to them to aggregate different
   reports into one coded event, and to supplement missing information
   based on other sources or their own background information. If not
   addressed properly, this may lead to a lack of replicability and to low
   reliability of the final data product. In this short article, we present
   an approach for separating (i) event reports and the information
   contained in them, and (ii) events, which are based on aggregate
   information from the reports and constitute the final data product. Our
   procedure preserves uncertainty arising from multiple reports and gives
   the user control over how missing and conflicting information should be
   dealt with. We illustrate our procedure with data from a current coding
   project, the Mass Mobilization in Autocracies Database (MMAD).

AB In the European registration procedure for pesticides, microcosm and
   mesocosm studies are the highest aquatic experimental tier to assess
   their environmental effects. Evaluations of microcosm/mesocosm studies
   rely heavily on no observed effect concentrations (NOECs) calculated for
   different population-level endpoints. Ideally, a power analysis should
   be reported for the concentration-response relationships underlying
   these NOECs, as well as for measurement endpoints for which significant
   effects cannot be demonstrated. An indication of this statistical power
   can be provided a posteriori by calculated minimum detectable
   differences (MDDs). The MDD defines the difference between the means of
   a treatment and the control that must exist to detect a statistically
   significant effect. The aim of this paper is to expand on the Aquatic
   Guidance Document recently published by the European Food Safety
   Authority (EFSA) and to propose a procedure to report and evaluate NOECs
   and related MDDs in a harmonised way. In addition, decision schemes are
   provided on how MDDs can be used to assess the reliability of
   microcosm/mesocosm studies and for the derivation of effect classes used
   to derive regulatory acceptable concentrations. Furthermore, examples
   are presented to show how MDDs can be reduced by optimising experimental
   design and sampling techniques.

AB The importance of replication has been recognised across many scientific
   disciplines. Reproducibility is a necessary condition for replicability,
   because an inability to reproduce results implies that the methods have
   not been specified sufficiently, thus precluding replication. This paper
   describes how two independent teams of researchers attempted to
   reproduce the empirical findings of an important paper, "Shrinkage
   estimators of time series seasonal factors and their effect on
   forecasting accuracy" (Miller & Williams, 2003). The two teams proceeded
   systematically, reporting results both before and after receiving
   clarifications from the authors of the original study. The teams were
   able to approximately reproduce each other's results, but not those of
   Miller and Williams. These discrepancies led to differences in the
   conclusions as to the conditions under which seasonal damping
   outperforms classical decomposition. The paper specifies the forecasting
   methods employed using a flowchart. It is argued that this approach to
   method documentation is complementary to the provision of computer code,
   as it is accessible to a broader audience of forecasting practitioners
   and researchers. The significance of this research lies not only in its
   lessons for seasonal forecasting but also, more generally, in its
   approach to the reproduction of forecasting research. (C) 2014

AB It is a widely held belief that bilinguals have an advantage over
   monolinguals in executive-control tasks, but is this what all studies
   actually demonstrate? The idea of a bilingual advantage may result from
   a publication bias favoring studies with positive results over studies
   with null or negative effects. To test this hypothesis, we looked at
   conference abstracts from 1999 to 2012 on the topic of bilingualism and
   executive control. We then determined which of the studies they reported
   were subsequently published. Studies with results fully supporting the
   bilingual-advantage theory were most likely to be published, followed by
   studies with mixed results. Studies challenging the bilingual advantage
   were published the least. This discrepancy was not due to differences in
   sample size, tests used, or statistical power. A test for funnel-plot
   asymmetry provided further evidence for the existence of a publication
   bias.

AB Context: Gamification seeks for improvement of the user's engagement,
   motivation, and performance when carrying out a certain task, by means
   of incorporating game mechanics and elements, thus making that task more
   attractive. Much research work has studied the application of
   gamification in software engineering for increasing the engagement and
   results of developers.
   Objective: The objective of this paper is to carry out a systematic
   mapping of the field of gamification in software engineering in an
   attempt to characterize the state of the art of this field identifying
   gaps and opportunities for further research.
   Method: We carried out a systematic mapping with a view to finding the
   primary studies in the existing literature, which were later classified
   and analyzed according to four criteria: the software process area
   addressed, the gamification elements used, the type of research method
   followed, and the type of forum in which they were published. A
   subjective evaluation of the studies was also carried out to evaluate
   them in terms of methodology, empirical evidence, integration with the
   organization, and replicability.
   Results: As a result of the systematic mapping we found 29 primary
   studies, published between January 2011 and June 2014. Most of them
   focus on software development, and to a lesser extent, requirements,
   project management, and other support areas. In the main, they consider
   very simple gamification mechanics such as points and badges, and few
   provide empirical evidence of the impact of gamification.
   Conclusions: Existing research in the field is quite preliminary, and
   more research effort analyzing the impact of gamification in SE would be
   needed. Future research work should look at other game mechanics in
   addition to the basic ones and should tackle software process areas that
   have not been fully studied, such as requirements, project management,
   maintenance, or testing. Most studies share a lack of methodological
   support that would make their proposals replicable in other settings.
   The integration of gamification with an organization's existing tools is
   also an important challenge that needs to be taken up in this field. (C)

   their results and implications. Literature review and case experience
   was utilised.

   prescriptions, pooling funds to achieve scale rather than delivering
   through fragmented projects, and building on national systems and
   capacities rather than setting up parallel mechanisms, the Transition
   Fund Model employed in Zimbabwe by UNICEF and partners in partnership
   with the Inclusive Government was able to achieve important results in
   health, education, social support and water services in a challenging
   setting. In addition, forums for collaboration were developed that
   provided a platform for further action. The initial emphasis on service
   delivery diffused much of the political delicateness that impeded
   progress in other sectors. The Zimbabwean experience may provide a model
   of innovative financing for countries facing similar circumstances.
   Summary: Such models may represent a new practical application of the
   Paris Principles, consistent with the major tenets of the 2011 New Deal
   for Engagement in Fragile States agreed in Busan. As we approach the
   Millennium Development Goal deadline, an over-arching, mutli-sectoral
   and independent evaluation of this approach is recommended in order to
   validate findings and assess broader replicability of this approach.

AB There has been a substantial increase in the use of personality
   assessment measures constructed using items from the International
   Personality Item Pool (IPIP) such as the 300-item IPIP-NEO (Goldberg,
   1999), a representation of the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO
   PI-R; Costa & McCrae, 1992). The IPIP-NEO is free to use and can be
   modified to accommodate its users' needs. Despite the substantial
   interest in this measure, there is still a dearth of data demonstrating
   its convergence with the NEO PI-R. The present study represents an
   investigation of the reliability and validity of scores on the IPIP-NEO.
   Additionally, we used item response theory (IRT) methodology to create a
   120-item version of the IPIP-NEO. Using an undergraduate sample (n =
   359), we examined the reliability, as well as the convergent and
   criterion validity, of scores from the 300-item IPIP-NEO, a previously
   constructed 120-item version of the IPIP-NEO (Johnson, 2011), and the
   newly created IRT-based IPIP-120 in comparison to the NEO PI-R across a
   range of outcomes. Scores from all 3 IPIP measures demonstrated strong
   reliability and convergence with the NEO PI-R and a high degree of
   similarity with regard to their correlational profiles across the
   criterion variables (r(ICC) = .983,.972, and .976, respectively). The
   replicability of these findings was then tested in a community sample (n
   = 757), and the results closely mirrored the findings from Sample 1.
   These results provide support for the use of the IPIP-NEO and both
   120-item IPIP-NEO measures as assessment tools for measurement of the
   five-factor model.

   absolutely not replicable. To prove this I rely on two arguments-the
   Author Argument and the Love Argument. The irreplicability of persons
   relies upon the singularity of each person and thus entails that
   personal identity is irreducible and that it really does matter.

   structure of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) in
   predominately White or African American samples, no published research
   has reported on the factor structure among Hispanic women who reside in
   the United States. Objective: The current study examined the factor
   structure of the EPDS among Hispanic mothers in the United States.
   Method: Among 220 Hispanic women, drawn from a pediatric primary care
   setting, with an infant aged 0 to 10 months, 6 structural models guided
   by the empirical literature were evaluated using confirmatory factor
   analysis. Results: Results supported a 2-factor model of depression and
   anxiety as the best fitting model. Multigroup models supported the
   factorial invariance across women who completed the EDPS in English and
   Spanish. Conclusion: These findings provide initial support for the
   2-factor structure of the EPDS among Hispanic women in the United
   States. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Crop monitoring during the growing season is important for regional
   management decisions and biomass prediction. The objectives of this
   study were to develop, improve and validate a scale independent biomass
   model. Field studies were conducted in Huimin County, Shandong Province
   of China, during the 2006-2007 growing season of winter wheat (Triticum
   aestivum L). The field design had a multiscale set-up with four levels
   which differed in their management, such as nitrogen fertilizer inputs
   and cultivars, to create different biomass conditions: small
   experimental fields (L1), large experimental fields (L2), small farm
   fields (L3), and large farm fields (L4). L4, planted with different
   winter wheat varieties, was managed according to farmers' practice while
   Li through L3 represented controlled field experiments. Multitemporal
   spectral measurements were taken in the fields, and biomass was sampled
   for each spectral campaign. In addition, multitemporal Hyperion data
   were obtained in 2006 and 2007. Li field data were used to develop
   biomass models based on the relation between the winter wheat spectra
   and biomass: several published vegetation indices, including NRI, REP,
   OSAVI, TCI, and NDVI, were investigated. A new hyperspectral vegetation
   index, which uses a four-band combination in the NIR and SWIR domains,
   named GnyLi, was developed. Following the multiscale concept, the data
   of higher levels (L2 through L4) were used stepwise to validate and
   improve the models of the lower levels, and to transfer the improved
   models to the next level. Lastly, the models were transferred and
   validated at the regional scale using Hyperion images of 2006 and 2007.
   The results showed that the GnyLi and NRI models, which were based on
   the NIR and SWIR domains, performed best with R-2 > 0.74. All the other
   indices explained less than 60% model variability. Using the Hyperion
   data for regionalization, GnyLi and NRI explained 81-89% of the biomass
   variability. These results highlighted that GnyLi and NRI can be used
   together with hyperspectral images for both plot and regional level
   biomass estimation. Nevertheless, additional studies and analyses are
   needed to test its replicability in other environmental conditions. (C)

AB Background: RNA or RNA-like polymers are the most likely candidates for
   having played the lead roles on the stage of the origin of life. RNA is
   known to feature two of the three essential functions of living entities
   (metabolism, heredity and membrane): it is capable of unlimited heredity
   and it has a proven capacity for catalysing very different chemical
   reactions which may form simple metabolic networks. The Metabolically
   Coupled Replicator System is a class of simulation models built on these
   two functions to show that an RNA World scenario for the origin of life
   is ecologically feasible, provided that it is played on mineral
   surfaces. The fact that RNA templates and their copies are of
   complementary base sequences has an obvious dynamical relevance:
   complementary strains may have very different structures and,
   consequently, functions - one may specialize for increasing enzymatic
   activity while the other takes the role of the gene of the enzyme.
   Results: Incorporating the functional divergence of template and copy
   into the Metabolically Coupled Replicator System model framework we show
   that sequence complementarity 1) does not ruin the coexistence of a set
   of metabolically cooperating replicators; 2) the replicator system
   remains resistant to, but also tolerant with its parasites; 3) opens the
   way to the evolutionary differentiation of phenotype and genotype
   through a primitive version of phenotype amplification.
   Conclusions: The functional asymmetry of complementary RNA strains
   results in a shift of phenotype/genotype (enzyme/gene) proportions in
   MCRS, favouring a slight genotype dominance. This asymmetry is expected
   to reverse due to the evolved trade-off of high "gene" replicability and
   high catalytic activity of the corresponding "enzyme" in expense of its
   replicability. This trade-off is the first evolutionary step towards the
   "division of labour" among enzymes and genes, which has concluded in the
   extreme form of phenotype amplification characteristic of our recent
   DNA-RNA protein World.

AB Families can be one of the most protective forces in the lives of
   children and youth. Family skills interventions have been found to be
   effective in encouraging safe and nurturing relationships between
   parents (or caregivers) and children in their early years and as such
   preventing many problem behaviours including violence. Most of the
   evidence in this regards is generated from high income countries. In
   this article UNODC reports on variables associated with violence
   (including conduct problems, stress management, pro-social behaviours,
   family aggression and conflict) generated from a multisite project aimed
   at piloting family skills programmes in low and middle income countries.
   The countries of concern are Panama, Honduras, Guatemala, Serbia,
   Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The
   family skills piloted were Strengthening the Families Programme 10-14
   (SFP 10-14) and Families And Schools Together (FAST). The data generated
   indicates high level of replicability with fidelity, affinity and need
   for such programmes in low and middle income countries with very
   encouraging in preventing violence. Significant changes at the post-test
   level, assessed through multi-sources, were recorded across most of the
   violence indicators assessed related to youth violence and child
   maltreatment at least on a comparable level to high-income countries.

AB Statistical power depends on the size of the effect of interest.
   However, effect sizes are rarely fixed in psychological research: Study
   design choices, such as the operationalization of the dependent variable
   or the treatment manipulation, the social context, the subject pool, or
   the time of day, typically cause systematic variation in the effect
   size. Ignoring this between-study variation, as standard power formulae
   do, results in assessments of power that are too optimistic.
   Consequently, when researchers attempting replication set sample sizes
   using these formulae, their studies will be underpowered and will thus
   fail at a greater than expected rate. We illustrate this with both
   hypothetical examples and data on several well-studied phenomena in
   psychology. We provide formulae that account for between-study variation
   and suggest that researchers set sample sizes with respect to our
   generally more conservative formulae. Our formulae generalize to
   settings in which there are multiple effects of interest. We also
   introduce an easy-to-use website that implements our approach to setting
   sample sizes. Finally, we conclude with recommendations for quantifying
   between-study variation.

AB Although many researchers have discussed replication as a means to
   facilitate self-correcting science, in this article, we identify
   meta-analyses and evaluating the validity of correlational and causal
   inferences as additional processes crucial to self-correction. We argue
   that researchers have a duty to describe sampling decisions they make;
   without such descriptions, self-correction becomes difficult, if not
   impossible. We developed the Replicability and Meta-Analytic Suitability
   Inventory (RAMSI) to evaluate the descriptive adequacy of a sample of
   studies taken from current psychological literature. Authors described
   only about 30% of the sampling decisions necessary for self-correcting
   science. We suggest that a modified RAMSI can be used by authors to
   guide their written reports and by reviewers to inform editorial
   recommendations. Finally, we claim that when researchers do not describe
   their sampling decisions, both readers and reviewers may assume that
   those decisions do not matter to the outcome of the study, do not affect
   inferences made from the research findings, do not inhibit inclusion in
   meta-analyses, and do not inhibit replicability of the study. If these
   assumptions are in error, as they often are, and the neglected decisions
   are relevant, then the neglect may create a good deal of mischief in the
   field.

AB We present the concept of a community-augmented meta-analysis (CAMA), a
   simple yet novel tool that significantly facilitates the accumulation
   and evaluation of previous studies within a specific scientific field. A
   CAMA is a combination of a meta-analysis and an open repository. Like a
   meta-analysis, it is centered around a psychologically relevant topic
   and includes methodological details and standardized effect sizes. As in
   a repository, data do not remain undisclosed and static after
   publication but can be used and extended by the research community, as
   anyone can download all information and can add new data via simple
   forms. Based on our experiences with building three CAMAs, we illustrate
   the concept and explain how CAMAs can facilitate improving our research
   practices via the integration of past research, the accumulation of
   knowledge, and the documentation of file-drawer studies.

AB A recent genome-wide-association study of educational attainment
   identified three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) whose
   associations, despite their small effect sizes (each R-2 approximate to
   0.02%), reached genome-wide significance (p < 5 x 10(-8)) in a large
   discovery sample and were replicated in an independent sample (p < .05).
   The study also reported associations between educational attainment and
   indices of SNPs called polygenic scores. In three studies, we evaluated
   the robustness of these findings. Study 1 showed that the associations
   with all three SNPs were replicated in another large (N = 34,428)
   independent sample. We also found that the scores remained predictive
   (R-2 approximate to 2%) in regressions with stringent controls for
   stratification (Study 2) and in new within-family analyses (Study 3).
   Our results show that large and therefore well-powered
   genome-wide-association studies can identify replicable genetic
   associations with behavioral traits. The small effect sizes of
   individual SNPs are likely to be a major contributing factor explaining
   the striking contrast between our results and the disappointing
   replication record of most candidate-gene studies.

AB Background: Previous research mainly focused on responses to negative
   affect in relation to depression, and less on responses to positive
   affect. Cognitive responses to positive affect are interesting in the
   context of emotion regulation and emotion disorders: positive rumination
   is associated to hypomania risk and bipolar disorder. There is to date
   no questionnaire in Swedish that captures the phenomena of cognitive
   response styles. Aims: The aim of this study was to investigate the
   replicability of the Responses to Positive Affect questionnaire (RPA) in
   a newly translated Swedish version and to test its psychometric
   properties. Methods: Swedish undergraduates (n = 111) completed a set of
   self-report questionnaires in a fixed order. Results: The hypothesized
   three-factor model was largely replicated in the subscales Self-focused
   positive rumination, Emotion-focused positive rumination and Dampening.
   The two positive rumination subscales were strongly associated with each
   other and current positive affect. The subscales showed acceptable
   convergent and incremental validity with concurrent measures of
   depression, hypomania, anxiety, repetitive negative thinking, and
   positive and negative affect. The model explained 25% of the variance in
   hypomania, but fell short in the explanation of depression. Conclusions:
   The Swedish version of the RPA shows satisfactory reliability and

AB The present study aims to develop a short form of the Perceived
   Political Self-Efficacy scale (PPSE-S). The psychometric properties of
   the short form were first investigated in an Italian sample (n = 697),
   and compared with those of the extended version. The cross-cultural
   replicability of the short form was then investigated in Spain (n =
   354), and Greece (n = 270). Finally, the relations between the PPSE-S
   and several indicators of political participation were assessed in each
   country. Results from confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) supported the
   unidimensionality of the PPSE-S. Reliability and criterion validity of
   the short- and the full-length scales were found to be substantially
   equivalent. Multigroup CFA provided evidence of measurement invariance
   across Italy, Spain, and Greece. Perceived political efficacy was
   positively related to political engagement in a stable and consistent
   way across the three countries. In light of these results, the
   usefulness and applicability of the PPSE-S for large-scale surveys were
   discussed.

AB Following international trends, Turkey has recently introduced
   decentralisation reforms to its highly centralised public administration
   system. These reforms have also applied to the cultural heritage sector,
   where innovative laws since 2004 have allowed local administrations and
   private actors to play new entrepreneurial roles. The Gaziantep
   Metropolitan Municipality has been a pioneer in this process, promoting
   policies that promote cultural tourism as an engine of economic growth.
   Under its leadership, hundreds of historic buildings have been restored,
   nine new museums and heritage sites opened, and museum visitors
   increased tenfold. These positive results make Gaziantep an interesting
   case of successful decentralisation in heritage management. Despite
   these successes, however, the disconnection between rhetoric and
   results, and the fragmentation and ambiguity of responsibilities
   emerging from the decentralisation process raises serious questions
   about its sustainability and replicability.

AB There has been a strong recent interest in applying quantum theory (QT)
   outside physics, including in cognitive science. We analyze the
   applicability of QT to two basic properties in opinion polling. The
   first property (response replicability) is that, for a large class of
   questions, a response to a given question is expected to be repeated if
   the question is posed again, irrespective of whether another question is
   asked and answered in between. The second property (question order
   effect) is that the response probabilities frequently depend on the
   order in which the questions are asked. Whenever these two properties
   occur together, it poses a problem for QT. The conventional QT with
   Hermitian operators can handle response replicability, but only in the
   way incompatible with the question order effect. In the generalization
   of QT known as theory of positive-operator-valued measures (POVMs), in
   order to account for response replicability, the POVMs involved must be
   conventional operators. Although these problems are not unique to QT and
   also challenge conventional cognitive theories, they stand out as
   important unresolved problems for the application of QT to cognition.
   Either some new principles are needed to determine the bounds of
   applicability of QT to cognition, or quantum formalisms more general
   than POVMs are needed.

AB Naturalistic stimuli, such as normal speech and narratives, are opening
   up intriguing prospects in neuroscience, especially when merging
   neuroimaging with machine learning methodology. Here we propose a
   task-optimized spatial filtering strategy for uncovering individual
   magnetoencephalographic (MEG) responses to audiobook stories. Ten
   subjects listened to 1-h-long recording once, as well as to 48
   repetitions of a 1-min-long speech passage. Employing response
   replicability as statistical validity and utilizing unsupervised
   learning methods, we trained spatial filters that were able to
   generalize over datasets of an individual. For this
   blind-signal-separation (BSS) task, we derived a version of multi-set
   similarity-constrained canonical correlation analysis (SimCCA) that
   theoretically provides maximal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in this
   setting. Irrespective of significant noise in unaveraged MEG traces, the
   method successfully uncovered feasible time courses up to similar to 120
   Hz, with the most prominent signals below 20 Hz. Individual
   trial-to-trial correlations of such time courses reached the level of
   0.55 (median 0.33 in the group) at similar to 0.5 Hz, with considerable
   variation between subjects. By this filtering, the SNR increased up to
   20 times. In comparison, independent component analysis (ICA) or
   principal component analysis (PCA) did not improve SNR notably. The
   validity of the extracted brain signals was further assessed by
   inspecting their associations with the stimulus, as well as by mapping
   the contributing cortical signal sources. The results indicate that the
   proposed methodology effectively reduces noise in MEG recordings to that
   extent that brain responses can be seen to nonrecurring audiobook
   stories. The study paves the way for applications aiming at accurately
   modeling the stimulus-response-relationship by tackling the response
   variability, as well as for real-time monitoring of brain signals of
   individuals in naturalistic experimental conditions. (C) 2014 The

   in social-personality psychology by ranking those journals with respect
   to their N-pact Factors (NF)-the statistical power of the empirical
   studies they publish to detect typical effect sizes. Power is a
   particularly important attribute for evaluating research quality
   because, relative to studies that have low power, studies that have high
   power are more likely to (a) to provide accurate estimates of effects,
   (b) to produce literatures with low false positive rates, and (c) to
   lead to replicable findings. The authors show that the average sample
   size in social-personality research is 104 and that the power to detect
   the typical effect size in the field is approximately 50%. Moreover,
   they show that there is considerable variation among journals in sample
   sizes and power of the studies they publish, with some journals
   consistently publishing higher power studies than others. The authors
   hope that these rankings will be of use to authors who are choosing
   where to submit their best work, provide hiring and promotion committees
   with a superior way of quantifying journal quality, and encourage

AB Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) offers a unique opportunity to
   measure brain metabolites in-vivo, and in doing so enables one to
   understand the brain function and cellular processes implicated in the
   pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. MRS, in addition to being
   non-invasive, is devoid of radioactive tracers and ionizing radiation, a
   distinct advantage over other imaging modalities like positron emission
   tomography and single photon emission computed tomography. With advances
   in MRS technique it is now possible to quantify concentrations of
   relevant compounds like neurotransmitters, neuronal viability markers
   and pharmacological compounds. Majority of the MRS studies have examined
   the neurometabolites in schizophrenia, a common and debilitating
   psychiatric disorder. Abnormalities in N Acetyl aspartate and Glutamate
   are consistently reported while the reports regarding the myoinsoitol
   and choline are inconsistent. These abnormalities are not changed across
   the illness stages and despite treatment. However, multiple technical
   challenges have limited the widespread use of MRS in psychiatric
   disorders. Guidelines for uniform acquisition and preprocessing are need
   of the hour, which. would increase the replicability and validity of MRS
   measures in psychiatry. Finally long term, prospective, longitudinal
   studies are required in different psychiatric disorders for potential
   clinical applications.

   In C. elegans, CEP-1 is the sole homolog of the p53 family of genes. In

   under normal and UV stressed conditions, we applied the 'not-so-random'
   hexamers priming strategy to RNA sequencing in C. elegans, This NSR-seq
   strategy efficiently depleted rRNA transcripts from the samples and
   showed high technical replicability. We identified more than 1,000
   ncRNAs whose apparent expression was repressed by CEP-1, while around
   200 were activated. Around 40% of the CEP-1 activated ncRNAs promoters
   contain a putative CEP-1-binding site. CEP-1 regulated ncRNAs were
   frequently clustered and concentrated on the X chromosome. These results
   indicate that numerous ncRNAs are involved in CEP-1 transcriptional
   network and that these are especially enriched on the X chromosome in C.

   development and evaluation of such indexes. In reviewing these 10
   questions - only six of which, it argues, are critical - the paper
   advances two broad arguments: First, more attention should be paid to
   the fundamentals of social science methodology, that is, concept
   formation, content validity, reliability, replicability, robustness, and
   the relevance of particular measures to underlying research questions.
   Second, less attention should be paid to other issues more commonly
   highlighted in the literature on governance measurement, that is,
   descriptive complexity, theoretical fit, the precision of estimates, and
   'correct' weighting. The paper builds on review of the literature and on
   three years of research in practice in developing a well-known
   governance index.

   publicly available PHOTO-ATTACK database with associated protocols to
   measure the effectiveness of counter-measures is introduced. Based on
   the data available, a study is conducted on current state-of-the-art
   spoofing detection algorithms based on motion analysis, showing they

   algorithms achieving nearly perfect scoring with an equal-error rate of
   1.52% on the available test data. The source code leading to the

AB Research often fails to find its way into practice or policy in a timely
   way, if at all. Given the current pressure and pace of health care
   change, many authors have recommended different approaches to make
   health care research more relevant and rapid. An emerging standard for
   research, the "5 R's" is a synthesis of recommendations for care
   delivery research that (1) is relevant to stakeholders; (2) is rapid and
   recursive in application; (3) redefines rigor; (4) reports on resources
   required; and (5) is replicable. Relevance flows from substantive
   ongoing participation by stakeholders. Rapidity and recursiveness occur
   through accelerated design and peer reviews followed by short
   learning/implementation cycles through which questions and answers
   evolve over time. Rigor is the disciplined conduct of shared learning
   within the specific changing situations in diverse settings. Resource
   reporting includes costs of interventions. Replicability involves
   designing for the factors that may affect subsequent implementation of
   an intervention or program in different contexts. These R's of the
   research process are mutually reinforcing and can be supported by
   training that fosters collaborative and reciprocal relationships among
   researchers, implementers, and other stakeholders. In sum, a standard is
   emerging for research that is both rigorous and relevant. Consistent and
   bold application will increase the value, timeliness, and applicability
   of the research enterprise.

AB In psychology, outliers are often excluded before running an independent

   handling of outliers in the context of independent samples t tests
   applied to nonnormal sum scores. After reviewing common practice, we
   present results of simulations of artificial and actual psychological
   data, which show that the removal of outliers based on commonly used Z
   value thresholds severely increases the Type I error rate. We found Type
   I error rates of above 20% after removing outliers with a threshold
   value of Z = 2 in a short and difficult test. Inflations of Type I error
   rates are particularly severe when researchers are given the freedom to
   alter threshold values of Z after having seen the effects thereof on
   outcomes. We recommend the use of nonparametric Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon
   tests or robust Yuen-Welch tests without removing outliers. These
   alternatives to independent samples t tests are found to have nominal
   Type I error rates with a minimal loss of power when no outliers are
   present in the data and to have nominal Type I error rates and good
   power when outliers are present.

AB We propose a new approach for island-wide planning and implementation of

   replicability, sustainability and cost-effectiveness in other
   approaches. 'Integrated island management' (IIM) operates through
   coordinated networks of institutions and communities focused on
   sustainable and adaptive management of natural resources. IIM enables
   simultaneous and cost-effective achievement of ecosystem-based
   management, climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction while
   conserving biodiversity, maintaining ecosystem services and securing
   human health and well-being. We present ten guiding principles for IIM,
   and then use these to evaluate 36 case studies from the Pacific islands.
   Most case studies were pilot or demonstration projects with little
   evidence of planning to ensure long-term financial and human capacity
   needs were sustained, beyond the life of the projects, or could be
   replicated at significant scales. Management outcomes in the Pacific
   will be enhanced by: (1) building on foundations of customary management
   practice and social networks; (2) working holistically across relevant
   ecological and governance scales, through coordinated but decentralized
   and nested institutions; (3) empowering local communities to participate
   in integrated planning and implementation; and (4) embedding IIM
   practice into national systems for long-term sustainability and
   replication. These also ultimately depend on the context and
   externalities, beyond the control of practitioners. Cost-effectiveness
   and appropriateness are also critical for successful IIM in the Pacific
   islands but ultimately there is little alternative for effective
   biodiversity conservation.

   (i) selection of moss species, (ii) ratio of moss weight to surface area
   of the bag, (iii) duration of exposure, and (iv) height of exposure. In
   the present study, the best option for each of these aspects was
   selected on the basis of the mean concentrations and data replicability
   of Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb and Zn measured during at least two exposure periods
   in environments affected by different degrees of contamination. The
   optimal choices for the studied aspects were the following: (i) Sphagnum

   surface, (iii) 8 weeks of exposure, and (iv) 4 m height of exposure.
   Duration of exposure and height of exposure accounted for most of the

   psychological publishing and how to best address those problems. First,
   the motivation behind questionable research practices is examined (the
   desire to get ahead or, at least, not fall behind). Next, behavior
   modification strategies are discussed, pointing out that reward works
   better than punishment. Humans are utility seekers and the
   implementation of current change initiatives is hindered by high initial
   buy-in costs and insufficient expected utility. Open science tools
   interested in improving science should team up, to increase utility
   while lowering the cost and risk associated with engagement. The best
   way to realign individual and group motives will probably be to create
   one, centralized, easy to use, platform, with a profile, a feed of
   targeted science stories based upon previous system interaction, a
   sophisticated (public) discussion section, and impact metrics which use
   the associated data These measures encourage high quality review and
   other prosocial activities while inhibiting self-serving behavior. Some
   advantages of centrally digitizing communications are outlined,
   including ways the data could be used to improve the peer review
   process. Most generally, it seems that decisions about change design and
   implementation should be theory and data driven.

AB Effective management of contaminated sediments is important for
   long-term human and environmental health, but site-management decisions
   are often made under high uncertainty and without the help of structured
   decision support tools. Potential trade-offs between remedial costs,
   environmental effects, human health risks, and societal benefits, as
   well as fundamental differences in stakeholder priorities, complicate
   decision making. Formal decision-analytic tools such as multicriteria
   decision analysis (MCDA) move beyond ad hoc decision support to
   quantitatively and holistically rank management alternatives and add
   transparency and replicability to the evaluation process. However, even
   the best decisions made under uncertainty may be found suboptimal in
   hindsight, once additional scientific, social, economic, or other
   details become known. Value of information (VoI) analysis extends MCDA
   by systematically evaluating the impact of uncertainty on a decision.
   VoI prioritizes future research in terms of expected decision relevance
   by helping decision makers estimate the likelihood that additional
   information will improve decision confidence or change their selection
   of a management plan. In this study, VoI analysis evaluates uncertainty,
   estimates decision confidence, and prioritizes research to inform
   selection of a sediment capping strategy for the dibenzo-p-dioxin and
   -furan contaminated Grenland fiord system in southern Norway. The VoI
   model extends stochastic MCDA to model decisions with and without
   simulated new information and compares decision confidence across
   scenarios with different degrees of remaining uncertainty. Results
   highlight opportunities for decision makers to benefit from additional
   information by anticipating the improved decision confidence (or lack
   thereof) expected from reducing uncertainties for each criterion or
   combination of criteria. This case study demonstrates the usefulness of
   VoI analysis for environmental decisions by predicting when decisions
   can be made confidently, for prioritizing areas of research to pursue to
   improve decision confidence, and for differentiating between
   decision-relevant and decision-irrelevant differences in evaluation
   perspectives, all of which help guide meaningful deliberation toward
   effective consensus solutions.

AB Background: The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is a widely
   used screening tool for postpartum depression (PPD). Although the
   reliability and validity of EPDS in Japanese has been confirmed and the
   prevalence of PPD is found to be about the same as Western countries,
   the factor structure of the Japanese version of EPDS has not been
   elucidated yet.
   Methods: 690 Japanese mothers completed all items of the EPDS at 1 month
   postpartum. We divided them randomly into two sample sets. The first
   sample set (n = 345) was used for exploratory factor analysis, and the
   second sample set was used (n = 345) for confirmatory factor analysis.
   Results: The result of exploratory factor analysis indicated a
   three-factor model consisting of anxiety, depression and anhedonia. The
   results of confirmatory factor analysis suggested that the anxiety and
   anhedonia factors existed for EPDS in a sample of Japanese women at 1
   month postpartum. The depression factor varies by the models of
   acceptable fit.
   Conclusions: We examined EPDS scores. As a result, "anxiety" and
   "anhedonia" exist for EPDS among postpartum women in Japan as already
   reported in Western countries. Cross-cultural research is needed for
   future research.

AB In response to what has been termed the "replicability crisis," great
   changes are currently under way in how science is conducted and
   disseminated. A question therefore arises over how such change impacts
   law's treatment of scientific evidence. The present standard for the
   admissibility of scientific evidence in federal courts in the U.S. asks
   judges to play the role of gatekeeper, determining if the proffered
   evidence conforms with several indicia of scientific validity. The
   replicability crisis, however, has demonstrated that these indicia
   frequently fail to adequately capture, or have lagged behind, science's
   best practices. Therefore, this article suggests that as much as the
   replicability crisis highlights serious issues in the scientific
   process, it should have similar implications and actionable consequences
   for legal practitioners and academics. The Article concludes with some
   suggestions to help ensure that legal decisions are influenced by the
   best science has to offer.

   translated from English into Portuguese using the forward-backward
   translation method and administered to a sample of 551 Portuguese
   workers. Exploratory factor analyses were conducted to test the
   replicability of the scale. The results confirmed the expected
   two-factor structure: harmonious passion and obsessive passion. However,
   the initial criterion of the replication of the factorial structure
   based on item factor loadings was not fulfilled. Criterion-related
   validity was tested by correlations with passion and job satisfaction.
   Regarding internal consistency, adequate alpha coefficients were
   obtained for both factors.

   research, the field has focused heavily on experimental design and not
   on the merit of replicating important results. The present study
   analyzed the complete publication history of the current top 100
   education journals ranked by 5-year impact factor and found that only
   0.13% of education articles were replications. Contrary to previous
   findings in medicine, but similar to psychology, the majority of
   education replications successfully replicated the original studies.
   However, replications were significantly less likely to be successful
   when there was no overlap in authorship between the original and
   replicating articles. The results emphasize the importance of
   third-party, direct replications in helping education research improve
   its ability to shape education policy and practice.

   replicability of this effect in a natural setting and population,
   imitation females were set out under light polluted and control
   conditions at varying light pollution intensities in an undisturbed
   British chalk grassland. Very low levels of light pollution were found
   to interfere with phototaxis: no males were attracted at either 0.3 or
   0.18 lux background lighting versus 33 males collected at paired dark
   controls. These background illumination levels are much lower than that
   of 1.5 lux which is recommended by local city councils in Britain to
   light footpaths. A survey of female L. noctiluca numbers and
   distribution showed a trend towards female clumping that was not
   statistically significant. We also found no evidence of light
   interfering with female signaling behavior.

AB Replication attempts are essential to the empirical sciences. Successful
   replication attempts increase researchers' confidence in the presence of
   an effect, whereas failed replication attempts induce skepticism and
   doubt. However, it is often unclear to what extent a replication attempt
   results in success or failure. To quantify replication outcomes we
   propose a novel Bayesian replication test that compares the adequacy of
   2 competing hypotheses. The 1st hypothesis is that of the skeptic and
   holds that the effect is spurious; this is the null hypothesis that
   postulates a zero effect size, H-0 : delta=0. The 2nd hypothesis is that
   of the proponent and holds that the effect is consistent with the one
   found in the original study, an effect that can be quantified by a
   posterior distribution. Hence, the 2nd hypothesis-the replication
   hypothesis-is given by H-r : delta similar to "posterior distribution
   from original study." The weighted-likelihood ratio between H-0 and H-r
   quantifies the evidence that the data provide for replication success
   and failure. In addition to the new test, we present several other
   Bayesian tests that address different but related questions concerning a
   replication study. These tests pertain to the independent conclusions of
   the separate experiments, the difference in effect size between the
   original experiment and the replication attempt, and the overall
   conclusion based on the pooled results. Together, this suite of Bayesian
   tests allows a relatively complete formalization of the way in which the
   result of a replication attempt alters our knowledge of the phenomenon
   at hand. The use of all Bayesian replication tests is illustrated with 3
   examples from the literature. For experiments analyzed using the t test,
   computation of the new replication test only requires the t values and
   the numbers of participants from the original study and the replication
   study.

AB Patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) report pain less frequently than
   their cognitively intact peers. It has been hypothesized that pain
   processing is altered in AD. The aim of this study was to investigate
   agreement and reliability of 3 pain sensitivity tests and to examine
   pain threshold and tolerance in patients with AD. We examined 29
   patients with mild to moderate AD and 29 age- and gender-matched healthy
   control subjects with quantitative sensory testing, ie, assessments of
   detection threshold (warmth detection threshold [WDT1) and pain
   threshold (heat pain threshold [HPT], pressure algometry, cold pressor
   test), and assessments of tolerance (pressure algometry, cold pressor
   test). All procedures were done twice on day 1, 1 hour apart, and
   repeated on day 2. We found no difference between groups for WDT
   (patient vs control subjects: mean [95% confidence interval]: 35.5
   degrees C [33.4 degrees C to 37.6 degrees C] vs 35.4 degrees C [34.3
   degrees C to 36.5 degrees C], P=.8) or HPT (41.2 degrees C [40.0 degrees
   C to 42.4 degrees C] vs 423 degrees C [41.1 degrees C to 43.5 degrees
   C], P=.24). We observed comparable thresholds for pressure algometry
   (median [25% to 75% interquartile range]: 120 kPa [100 to 142 kPa] vs
   131 kPa [113 to 192 kPa], P=.10), but significantly lower tolerance in
   AD patients (213 kPa [188 to 306 kPa] vs 289 kPa [262 to 360 kPa],
   P=.008). No differences were found for the cold pressor test. The study
   demonstrated good replicability of the sensory testing data with
   comparable data variability, for both groups, which supports the use of
   these methods in studies of patients with mild to moderate AD. Contrary
   to previous studies, we observed a reduced pain tolerance in patients
   with mild to moderate AD, which suggests that the reduced report of pain
   cannot be explained by reduced processing of painful stimuli. (C) 2014

   undercontrolled (U), and overcontrolled (O) types. In this study, we
   examined the cross-cultural replicability of the RUO types in Italy,
   Poland, Spain, and the United States. Personality types were identified
   using cluster analyses of Big Five profiles in large samples of college
   students from Italy (n = 322), the United States (n = 499), Spain (n =
   420), and Poland (n = 235). Prior to clustering the profiles, the
   measurement invariance of the Big Five measure across samples was
   tested. We found evidence for the RUO types in all four samples. The
   three-cluster solution showed a better fit over alternative solutions
   and had a relatively high degree of cross-cultural generalizability. The
   RUO types are evident in samples from four countries with distinct
   linguistic and cultural traditions. Results were discussed in light of
   the importance of considering how traits are organized within
   individuals for advancing contemporary personality psychology.

AB Background: The removal of outliers to acquire a significant result is a
   questionable research practice that appears to be commonly used in
   psychology. In this study, we investigated whether the removal of
   outliers in psychology papers is related to weaker evidence (against the
   null hypothesis of no effect), a higher prevalence of reporting errors,
   and smaller sample sizes in these papers compared to papers in the same
   journals that did not report the exclusion of outliers from the
   analyses.
   Methods and Findings: We retrieved a total of 2667 statistical results
   of null hypothesis significance tests from 153 articles in main
   psychology journals, and compared results from articles in which
   outliers were removed (N = 92) with results from articles that reported
   no exclusion of outliers (N = 61). We preregistered our hypotheses and
   methods and analyzed the data at the level of articles. Results show no
   significant difference between the two types of articles in median p
   value, sample sizes, or prevalence of all reporting errors, large
   reporting errors, and reporting errors that concerned the statistical
   significance. However, we did find a discrepancy between the reported
   degrees of freedom of t tests and the reported sample size in 41% of
   articles that did not report removal of any data values. This suggests
   common failure to report data exclusions (or missingness) in
   psychological articles.
   Conclusions: We failed to find that the removal of outliers from the
   analysis in psychological articles was related to weaker evidence
   (against the null hypothesis of no effect), sample size, or the
   prevalence of errors. However, our control sample might be contaminated
   due to nondisclosure of excluded values in articles that did not report
   exclusion of outliers. Results therefore highlight the importance of
   more transparent reporting of statistical analyses.

AB The reproducibility of the electrical characteristics of molecular
   junctions has been notoriously low. This paper describes a method to
   construct tunnel junctions based on self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) by
   forming reversible electrical contacts to SAMs using top-electrodes of a
   non-Newtonian liquid-metal (GaOx/EGaIn) stabilized in a
   microfluidic-based device. A single top-electrode can be used to form up
   to 15-25 junctions. This method generates SAM-based junctions with
   highly reproducible electrical characteristics in terms of precision
   (widths of distributions) and replicability (closeness to a reference
   value). The reason is that this method, unlike other approaches that
   rely on cross-bar or nano/micropore configurations, does not require
   patterning of the bottom-electrodes and is compatible with ultra-flat
   template-stripped (TS) surfaces. This compatibly with non-patterned
   electrodes is important for three reasons. i) No edges of the electrodes
   are present at which SAMs cannot pack well. ii) Patterning requires
   photoresist that may contaminate the electrode and complicate SAM
   formation. iii) TS-surfaces contain large grains, have low rms values,
   and can be obtained and used (in ordinary laboratory conditions) within
   a few seconds to minimize contamination. The junctions have very good
   electrical stability (2500 current-voltage cycles and retained currents
   for 27 h), and can be fabricated with good yields (approximate to 78%).

AB The abuse of prescription opioids imposes a substantial public health
   and economic burden. Recent research using administrative claims data
   has substantiated the prevalence and cost of opioid abuse among
   commercially insured individuals. Although administrative claims data
   are readily available and have been used to effectively answer research
   questions about the burden of illness for many different conditions, an
   important issue is the reliability, replicability, and generalizability
   of estimates derived from different databases. Therefore, this study
   sought to assess whether the findings of a recently published study of
   opioid abuse in a commercial claims database (original analysis) could
   be replicated in a different commercial claims database. The original
   analysis, which analyzed the prevalence and excess health care costs of
   diagnosed opioid abuse in the OptumHealth Reporting and Insights
   Database, was replicated by applying the same approach to the Truven
   MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database (replication
   analysis). In the replication analysis, the prevalence of diagnosed
   opioid abuse increased steadily from 15.8 diagnosed opioid abusers per
   10 000 in 2009, to 26.6 diagnosed opioid abusers per 10 000 in 2012.
   Although the prevalence of diagnosed opioid abuse was higher than
   reported in the original analysis, the trend of increasing prevalence

   the replication analysis, which was consistent with the excess annual
   per patient health care costs of diagnosed abuse of $ 10 627 reported in

AB Issues of publication bias, lack of replicability, and false discovery
   have long plagued the genetics community. Proper utilization of public
   and shared data resources presents an opportunity to ameliorate these
   problems. We present an approach to public database management that we
   term Quality Preserving Database (QPD). It enables perpetual use of the
   database for testing statistical hypotheses while controlling false
   discovery and avoiding publication bias on the one hand, and maintaining
   testing power on the other hand. We demonstrate it on a use case of a
   replication server for GWAS findings, underlining its practical utility.
   We argue that a shift to using QPD in managing current and future
   biological databases will significantly enhance the community's ability
   to make efficient and statistically sound use of the available data

AB Sedentary lifestyle is associated with cardiovascular and metabolic
   diseases. A compelling body of evidence demonstrates the amelioration
   and prevention of such conditions with increased levels of physical
   activity (PA). Despite this evidence, many public health initiatives
   aimed at increasing PA have failed to demonstrate clinically relevant
   effects on public health. It has been hypothesized that the highly
   controlled environments in which PA and health research is conducted
   limits its replicability in real-world community settings. This review
   aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of community fitness center-based
   interventions on inactivity-related diseases in adults. Data from 11
   investigations highlighted 3 factors: 1) a lack of community-based PA
   studies, 2) a lack of clinically relevant data, and 3) further reliance
   on self-report and rudimentary measurements. It is concluded that the
   current laboratory-based evidence for PA and health is to be replicated
   yet in real-world settings and that rigorous and clinically relevant
   naturalistic research is required.

AB The present study deals with an important problem that currently affects
   scientists and society, namely, the falsification and manipulation of
   research and researchers' CVs, which has considerably increased in
   recent years. This is shown by some studies, the authors of which have
   found high percentages of researchers who falsify their CV or manipulate
   data. We analyze the system used to evaluate science and researchers,
   which is almost exclusively based on the impact factor. We review the
   main critiques on the inappropriate use of the impact factor to assess
   researchers and argue that this has generated a new style of thinking in
   which the only goal is to obtain publications with an impact factor.
   Over the last few years, the pressure to publish has led to an obsession
   among researchers to disseminate the multiple indicators of their
   scientific publications over the Internet, to the extent that such
   initiatives look like marketing campaigns where researchers advertise
   themselves. For all these reasons, we propose that this may be a new
   psychological disorder, given that several criteria indicating
   maladaptation are clearly met: falsification and/or manipulation of
   data, falsification of publication indicators, distortion of reality,
   belief in manipulated data, and an obsession to conduct marketing
   campaigns of oneself. We address the important ethical and legal
   implications of such falsifications. Finally, we discuss the need to
   change the system used to evaluate science and researchers, which
   undoubtedly promotes these dishonest behaviors or this psychological
   dysfunction. (C) 2014 Colegio Oficial de Psicologos de Madrid.

AB BackgroundThere is general agreement that facial activity during pain
   conveys pain-specific information but is nevertheless characterized by
   substantial inter-individual differences. With the present study we aim
   to investigate whether these differences represent idiosyncratic
   variations or whether they can be clustered into distinct facial
   activity patterns.
   MethodsFacial actions during heat pain were assessed in two samples of
   pain-free individuals (n=128; n=112) and were later analysed using the
   Facial Action Coding System. Hierarchical cluster analyses were used to
   look for combinations of single facial actions in episodes of pain. The
   stability/replicability of facial activity patterns was determined
   across samples as well as across different basic social situations.
   ResultsCluster analyses revealed four distinct activity patterns during
   pain, which stably occurred across samples and situations: (I) narrowed
   eyes with furrowed brows and wrinkled nose; (II) opened mouth with
   narrowed eyes; (III) raised eyebrows; and (IV) furrowed brows with
   narrowed eyes. In addition, a considerable number of participants were
   facially completely unresponsive during pain induction (stoic cluster).
   These activity patterns seem to be reaction stereotypies in the majority
   of individuals (in nearly two-thirds), whereas a minority displayed
   varying clusters across situations.
   ConclusionThese findings suggest that there is no uniform set of facial
   actions but instead there are at least four different facial activity
   patterns occurring during pain that are composed of different
   configurations of facial actions. Raising awareness about these
   different faces of pain' might hold the potential of improving the
   detection and, thereby, the communication of pain.

AB We present MBIS (Multivariate Bayesian Image Segmentation tool), a
   clustering tool based on the mixture of multivariate normal
   distributions model. MBIS supports multichannel bias field correction
   based on a B-spline model. A second methodological novelty is the
   inclusion of graph-cuts optimization for the stationary anisotropic
   hidden Markov random field model. Along with MBIS, we release an
   evaluation framework that contains three different experiments on
   multi-site data. We first validate the accuracy of segmentation and the
   estimated bias field for each channel. MBIS outperforms a widely used
   segmentation tool in a cross-comparison evaluation. The second
   experiment demonstrates the robustness of results on atlas-free
   segmentation of two image sets from scan-rescan protocols on 21 healthy
   subjects. Multivariate segmentation is more replicable than the
   monospectral counterpart on T1-weighted images. Finally, we provide a
   third experiment to illustrate how MBIS can be used in a large-scale
   study of tissue volume change with increasing age in 584 healthy
   subjects. This last result is meaningful as multivariate segmentation
   performs robustly without the need for prior knowledge. (C) 2014

AB Background: Parental use of love withdrawal is thought to affect
   children's later psychological functioning because it creates a link
   between children's performance and relational consequences. In addition,
   recent studies have begun to show that experiences of love withdrawal
   also relate to the neural processing of socio-emotional information
   relevant to a performance-relational consequence link, and can moderate
   effects of oxytocin on social information processing and behavior. The
   current study follows-up on our previous results by attempting to
   confirm and extend previous findings indicating that experiences of
   maternal love withdrawal are related to electrocortical responses to
   emotional faces presented with performance feedback.
   Results: More maternal love withdrawal was related to enhanced early
   processing of facial feedback stimuli (reflected in more positive VPP
   amplitudes, and confirming previous findings). However, attentional
   engagement with and processing of the stimuli at a later stage were
   diminished in those reporting higher maternal love withdrawal (reflected
   in less positive LPP amplitudes, and diverging from previous findings).
   Conclusions: Maternal love withdrawal affects the processing of
   emotional faces presented with performance feedback differently in
   different stages of neural processing.

AB Over the past several years, two largely separate traditions have
   collided, leading to controversy over claims about priming. We describe
   and contrast the main accounts of priming effects in cognitive and
   social psychology, focusing especially on the role of awareness. In so
   doing, we consider one of the core points of contention: claims about
   the effects of subliminal priming. Whereas cognitive psychologists often
   are interested in exploring how priming operates with and without
   awareness, social psychologists more commonly assume subliminality in
   order to bolster claims about the automaticity of priming. We discuss
   the criteria necessary to claim that a stimulus was processed entirely
   without awareness, noting the challenges in meeting those criteria.
   Finally, we identify three sources of conflict between the fields:
   awareness, replicability, and the nature of the underlying processes. We
   close by proposing resolutions for each of them.

AB Subtle primes can influence behavior, often in ways that seem

   judgments can be influenced by anchors even when the anchors are known
   to be irrelevant and uninformative. In this article, we selectively
   examine the anchoring literature in order to evaluate a theoretical
   framework which has been employed to interpret many social and other
   priming effects. In this framework, primes are assumed to have broad
   effects, influencing a wide range of possible downstream behaviors, and
   these influences are largely automatic. The anchoring literature
   supports neither of these hypotheses. Anchors have narrow effects on
   behavior with little transfer across judgments, these effects can be
   controlled, and deliberate engagement with the anchor is a prerequisite
   for obtaining influences on later judgments. We question whether priming
   studies reveal evidence for the sort of automatic and consequential
   mental processes that are commonly proposed.

AB In this article, we argue that whether or not a replication attempt is
   informative is dependent on the accuracy of one's underlying model to
   explain the effect, as it is the explanatory model that enumerates the
   contingencies necessary for producing the effect. If the model is
   incorrect, then a researcher may unknowingly change variables that the
   model says are irrelevant but which are really essential, rendering the
   replication results ambiguous. The expectation that effects of priming
   on social behavior should be widely invariant makes sense only under the
   assumptions of strict direct expression and spreading activation models,
   yet it has been shown that these models cannot adequately explain
   findings from the priming literature. We describe one model of priming
   that predicts variability across experimental contexts and populations:
   the resource computation model. We highlight variables that have been
   uncovered under the assumptions of this model that cannot be accounted
   for by direct expression models and which can explain replication
   failures. The model is also consistent with evolutionary understandings
   of the mind, in which information from multiple sources beyond just
   stimulus information is incorporated into behavioral decisions. To the
   degree that anything other than a strict, direct expression, spreading
   activation model is correct, the expectation that priming of social
   behaviors should be widely invariant is unreasonable.

   This perspective organizes a range of moderators identified in previous

AB Evidence of stable standard setting results over panels or occasions is
   an important part of the validity argument for an established cut score.
   Unfortunately, due to the high cost of convening multiple panels of
   content experts, standards often are based on the recommendation from a
   single panel of judges. This approach implicitly assumes that the
   variability across panels will be modest, but little evidence is
   available to support this assertion. This article examines the stability
   of Angoff standard setting results across panels. Data were collected
   for six independent standard setting exercises, with three panels
   participating in each exercise. The results show that although in some
   cases the panel effect is negligible, for four of the six data sets the
   panel facet represented a large portion of the overall error variance.
   Ignoring the often hidden panel/occasion facet can result in
   artificially optimistic estimates of the cut score stability. Results
   based on a single panel should not be viewed as a reasonable estimate of
   the results that would be found over multiple panels. Instead, the
   variability seen in a single panel can best be viewed as a lower bound
   of the expected variability when the exercise is replicated.

AB Moral Foundations Theory posits five distinct foundations of morality:

   and Purity/Sanctity. In combination, this should yield between
   four-to-six moral signatures-distinct combinations or patterns of
   support for these aspects of morality. We extend previous research by
   examining the replicability of these moral signatures in a New
   Zealand-based national sample (n = 3,635). Latent Profile Analysis
   identified four distinct moral signatures: Individuators, Moderates,
   Neutrals, and High Moralists. We integrate these moral signatures within
   the Dual Process Model (DPM) framework and show that Social Dominance
   Orientation predicts membership in the Neutral moral signature
   (moderate/lukewarm support for multiple moral foundations); whereas
   Right-Wing Authoritarianism predicts membership in the High Moralist
   signature (undifferentiated high support across moral foundations).
   These findings were observed controlling for Big-Six personality and
   various demographics. Thus, the authoritarian and dominance-based
   motives identified by the DPM independently predict categorical
   differences in the signatures people use to judge morality.

AB Slepian, Masicampo, Toosi, and Ambady (Journal of Experimental
   Psychology: General, 141, 619-624, 2012, Study 1) found that individuals
   recalling and writing about a big, meaningful secret judged a pictured
   hill as steeper than did those who recalled and wrote about a small,
   inconsequential secret (with estimates unrelated to physical effort
   unaffected). From an embodied cognition perspective, this result was
   interpreted as suggesting that important secrets weigh people down.
   Answering to mounting calls for the crucial need of independent direct
   replications of published findings to ensure the self-correcting nature
   of our science, we sought to corroborate Slepian et al.'s finding in two
   extremely high-powered, preregistered studies that were very faithful to
   all procedural and methodological details of the original study (i.e.,
   same cover story, study title, manipulation, measures, item order, scale
   anchors, task instructions, sampling frame, population, and statistical
   analyses). In both samples, we were unsuccessful in replicating the
   target finding. Although Slepian et al. reported three other studies
   supporting the secret burdensomeness phenomenon, we advise that these
   three other findings need to be independently corroborated before the
   general phenomenon informs theory or health interventions.

   Respondents were performers employed at the Indigenous Peoples Culture

   the same design in a different research setting. In both studies two
   clusters of subjectivity were found: the 'Performers' View' and the

   support for this claim came from experiments using a 4-player public

   more money to a common project when they had to decide quickly (i.e., a
   decision based on intuition) than when they were instructed to reflect
   and decide slowly. This intuitive-cooperation effect is of high
   scientific and practical importance because it argues against a central
   assumption of traditional economic and evolutionary models. The first
   experiment of present study was set up to examine the generality of the
   intuitive-cooperation effect and to further validate the experimental
   task producing the effect. In Experiment 1, we investigated Amazon
   Mechanical Turk (AMT) workers' contributions to a 4-player public goods
   game with a marginal return of 0.5 while we manipulated the knowledge
   about the other players' contribution to the public goods game
   (contribution known vs. contribution unknown), the identity of the other
   players (humans vs. computers randomly generating contributions) and the
   time constraint (time pressure/intuition vs. forced delay/reflection).
   However, the results of Experiment 1 failed to reveal an
   intuitive-cooperation effect. Furthermore, four subsequent direct
   replications attempts with AMT workers (Experiments 2a, 2b, 2c and
   Experiment 3, which was conducted with naive/inexperienced participants)
   also failed to demonstrate intuitive-cooperation effects. Taken
   together, the results of the present study could not corroborate the
   idea that people are intuitively cooperative, hence suggesting that the
   theoretical relationship between intuition and cooperation should be
   further scrutinized.

AB Institution-oriented, top-down and community-oriented, bottom-up
   stakeholder approaches are evaluated for their ability to enable or
   constrain the implementation of adaptation in developing nations. A
   systematic review approach is used evaluate the project performance of
   18 adaptation projects by three of the Global Environment Facility's
   (GEF) adaptation programmes (the Strategic Priority for Adaptation
   (SPA), the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF), and the National
   Adaptation Programs of Action (NAPA)) according to effectiveness,
   efficiency, equity, legitimacy, flexibility, sustainability, and
   replicability. The ten SPA projects reviewed performed highest overall,
   especially with regards to efficiency, legitimacy, and replicability.
   The five SCCF projects performed the highest in equity, flexibility, and
   sustainability, and the three NAPA-related projects were the
   highest-performing projects with regards to effectiveness. A comparison
   of top-down and bottom-up approaches revealed that community stakeholder
   engagement in project design and implementation led to higher
   effectiveness, efficiency, equity, flexibility, legitimacy,
   sustainability, and replicability. Although low institutional capacity
   constrained both project success and effective community participation,
   projects that hired international staff to assist in implementation
   experienced higher overall performance. These case studies also
   illustrate how participatory methods can fail to genuinely empower or
   involve communities in adaptation interventions in both top-down and
   bottom-up approaches. It is thus crucial to carefully consider
   stakeholder engagement strategies in adaptation interventions.Policy
   relevanceWhile adaptation is now firmly on the policy and research
   agenda, actual interventions to reduce vulnerability and enhance
   resilience remain in their infancy, and there is limited information on
   the factors that influence the successful implementation of adaptation
   in developing areas. Engaging stakeholders in assessing vulnerability
   and implementing adaptation interventions is widely regarded to be an
   important factor for adaptation implementation and success. However, no
   study has evaluated the effects of stakeholder engagement in the actual
   implementation of adaptation initiatives. Effective stakeholder
   engagement is challenging, especially in a developing nation setting,
   due to high levels of poverty, inadequate knowledge on adaptation
   options, weak institutions, and competing interests to address more
   immediate problems related to poverty and underdevelopment. In this
   context, this article documents and characterizes stakeholder engagement
   in adaptation interventions supported through the GEF, examining how
   top-down or bottom-up stakeholder approaches enable or constrain project
   performance.

AB Many mammalian species, as well as birds, are able to use a mirror
   either in the context of self-recognition, or instrumentally for
   discovering and manipulating objects that cannot be perceived directly.
   A noteworthy study by Broom et al. (2009) investigated the ability of
   pigs (Sus scrofa) to use a mirror to locate a hidden food source. The
   mirror-experienced pigs appeared to be able to bypass a solid barrier
   that blocked direct view of a food bowl when the food bowl could be seen
   via a mirror. We tried to replicate these findings using 2 groups of 11
   piglets each. The procedure used for testing the first group of 11 pigs
   followed Broom's description as closely as possible. Only two of the
   pigs of the first group were able to locate the hidden food bowl during
   the mirror test. Therefore, measures were taken to increase the number
   of pigs noticing the mirror in the second group of 11 pigs. Now,
   although pigs notice the mirror significantly earlier, only 1 of the
   mirror-experienced pigs and none of the mirror-naive pigs used the
   detour around the partition wall to reach the hidden food. We take this
   observation as evidence that the pigs did not understand what the mirror
   image represents, and did not use the mirror to locate food. This
   indicates that not all pigs are capable of using mirrors under all
   circumstances, and thus that mirror use may be at the upper limits of
   cognitive capacity of these animals at this age. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB Failures to replicate published psychological research findings have
   contributed to a "crisis of confidence." Several reasons for these
   failures have been proposed, the most notable being questionable
   research practices and data fraud. We examine replication from a
   different perspective and illustrate that current intuitive expectations
   for replication are unreasonable. We used computer simulations to create
   thousands of ideal replications, with the same participants, wherein the
   only difference across replications was random measurement error. In the
   first set of simulations, study results differed substantially across
   replications as a result of measurement error alone. This raises
   questions about how researchers should interpret failed replication
   attempts, given the large impact that even modest amounts of measurement
   error can have on observed associations. In the second set of
   simulations, we illustrated the difficulties that researchers face when
   trying to interpret and replicate a published finding. We also assessed
   the relative importance of both sampling error and measurement error in
   producing variability in replications. Conventionally, replication
   attempts are viewed through the lens of verifying or falsifying
   published findings. We suggest that this is a flawed perspective and
   that researchers should adjust their expectations concerning
   replications and shift to a meta-analytic mind-set.

AB An essential first step in planning a confirmatory or a replication
   study is to determine the sample size necessary to draw statistically
   reliable inferences using power analysis. A key problem, however, is
   that what is available is the sample-size estimate of the effect size,
   and its use can lead to severely underpowered studies when the effect
   size is overestimated. As a potential remedy, we introduce safeguard
   power analysis, which uses the uncertainty in the estimate of the effect
   size to achieve a better likelihood of correctly identifying the
   population effect size. Using a lower-bound estimate of the effect size,
   in turn, allows researchers to calculate a sample size for a replication
   study that helps protect it from being underpowered. We show that in
   most common instances, compared with nominal power, safeguard power is
   higher whereas standard power is lower. We additionally recommend the
   use of safeguard power analysis to evaluate the strength of the evidence
   provided by the original study.

AB The current crisis in scientific psychology about whether our findings
   are irreproducible was presaged years ago by Tversky and Kahneman
   (1971), who noted that even sophisticated researchers believe in the
   fallacious Law of Small Numbers-erroneous intuitions about how
   imprecisely sample data reflect population phenomena. Combined with the
   low power of most current work, this often leads to the use of
   misleading criteria about whether an effect has replicated. Rosenthal
   (1990) suggested more appropriate criteria, here labeled the
   continuously cumulating meta-analytic (CCMA) approach. For example, a
   CCMA analysis on a replication attempt that does not reach significance
   might nonetheless provide more, not less, evidence that the effect is
   real. Alternatively, measures of heterogeneity might show that two
   studies that differ in whether they are significant might have only
   trivially different effect sizes. We present a nontechnical introduction
   to the CCMA framework (referencing relevant software), and then explain
   how it can be used to address aspects of replicability or more generally
   to assess quantitative evidence from numerous studies. We then present
   some examples and simulation results using the CCMA approach that show
   how the combination of evidence can yield improved results over the
   consideration of single studies.

AB The FP7 Theseus research project (2009-2013) aims to develop and assess
   innovative technologies and methodologies for coastal protection against
   erosion, flooding and environmental damages. While protection structures
   may help to reduce the level of hazard and the expected degree of loss,
   some danger of technical failures or human errors will always remain.
   For extreme events, the implementation of non-structural measures as
   early warning systems and disaster management practices is required to
   ensure the protection of population.
   During Theseus, a methodology for helping the local authorities to
   prepare an action plan in case of coastal flooding was developed and
   tested on the estuary of Gironde in France. The methodology builds over
   the return of experience from past events and tries to clearly identify
   all the stages of an evacuation and the thinking process that can lead
   to a robust evacuation plan. It relies on a conceptual framework -
   SADT-which helps to understand how data should be processed from its
   collection to its use in the plan. The risk scenarios were calculated
   for current and future conditions of the XXIst century, taking into
   account the effects of climate change. The methodology is supported by
   the OSIRIS software, prototyped during the FP5 eponymous project and
   later distributed by CETMEF and the French basin authorities of Loire
   and Meuse.
   The methodology for the preparation of evacuation plans was applied on a
   pilot city of Theseus, Bordeaux on the estuary of Gironde (France), and
   the software used to calculate evacuation times was tried out on
   Cesenatico near the Adriatic coast (Italy). This comparison verified the
   replicability of methodological guidelines in two different European
   contexts. The cultural and organizational differences and the different
   number of people involved underlined strong questions to be addressed
   when applying them. In order to assess the efficiency of an evacuation
   strategy and to compute the number of people successfully evacuated over
   time, a macroscopic model (not representing each individual vehicle but
   only flows of vehicles in congestion points) for the simulation of
   traffic congestion was used, based on the work of the University of
   Twente, Rijkswaterstaat and INFRAM. This model will be integrated in the
   Theseus decision support system for helping coastal managers to select
   their strategy for risk mitigation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Nearly all American states use one of two systems for setting the amount
   of child support that noncustodial parents (NCPs) are required to pay to
   custodial parents (CPs). In previous work, we found that lay judgments
   of the child support amount the law should require differ in meaningful
   ways from these two systems: Our respondents favored child support
   amounts that are more responsive to the NCP's income and much more
   responsive to the CP's income than set by either system. They also
   favored dollar amounts that increase more rapidly with NCP income when
   CP income is lower, producing a characteristic fanning lines pattern
   when dollar support amounts are charted against NCP income for several
   different CP incomes. We give the label "Fair Shares" to these two
   features of our respondents' child support judgments. We describe six
   new experimental studies that vary the context of these judgments in
   ways that test whether the "Fair Shares" account is robust. Our studies
   consistently replicate the fan-shaped pattern and shed further light on
   lay judgments.

AB Recent studies have indicated that research practices in psychology may
   be susceptible to factors that increase false-positive rates, raising
   concerns about the possible prevalence of false-positive findings. The
   present article discusses several practices that may run counter to the
   inflation of false-positive rates. Taking these practices into account
   would lead to a more balanced view on the false-positive issue.
   Specifically, we argue that an inflation of false-positive rates would
   diminish, sometimes to a substantial degree, when researchers (a) have
   explicit a priori theoretical hypotheses, (b) include multiple
   replication studies in a single paper, and (c) collect additional data
   based on observed results. We report findings from simulation studies
   and statistical evidence that support these arguments. Being aware of
   these preventive factors allows researchers not to overestimate the
   pervasiveness of false-positives in psychology and to gauge the
   susceptibility of a paper to possible false-positives in practical and
   fair ways.

   (n = 202) from several cultures in Israel (i.e., Israeli-born Jews
   [IBJs], Israeli-Russian immigrants, and Israeli-Arabs and Druze)
   listened to 40 pieces conveying five emotions (anger, fear, sadness,
   happiness, and serenity) and decoded their emotional content. The
   improvisations were performed by four IBJ musicians on four instruments
   (piano, darbuka, voice, and kazoo). No differences were found between
   the groups regarding four of the emotions and three of the instruments.
   However, IBJs were more accurate in identifying fear and emotions
   conveyed by kazoo. These findings demonstrate that people from different
   cultures within the same country have a similar ability to recognize
   emotions expressed through different musical instruments, with the
   exception of specific emotions and mediums. The results of this study
   also emphasize the potential of communication of emotions through

AB Given the difficulty and effort required to confirm candidate causal
   SNPs detected in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), there is no
   practical way to definitively filter false positives. Recent advances in
   algorithmics and statistics have enabled repeated exhaustive search for
   bivariate features in a practical amount of time using standard
   computational resources, allowing us to use cross-validation to evaluate
   the stability. We performed 10 trials of 2-fold cross-validation of
   exhaustive bivariate analysis on seven Wellcome-Trust Case-Control
   Consortium GWAS datasets, comparing the traditional chi(2) test for
   association, the high-performance GBOOST method and the recently
   proposed GSS statistic (Available at
   http://bioinformatics.research.nicta.com.au/software/gwis/). We use
   Spearman's correlation to measure the similarity between the folds of
   cross validation. To compare incomplete lists of ranks we propose an
   extension to Spearman's correlation. The extension allows us to consider
   a natural threshold for feature selection where the correlation is zero.
   This is the first reported cross-validation study of exhaustive
   bivariate GWAS feature selection. We found that stability between ranked
   lists from different cross-validation folds was higher for GSS in the
   majority of diseases. A thorough analysis of the correlation between
   SNP-frequency and univariate chi(2) score demonstrated that the chi(2)
   test for association is highly confounded by main effects: SNPs with
   high univariate significance replicably dominate the ranked results. We
   show that removal of the univariately significant SNPs improves chi(2)
   replicability but risks filtering pairs involving SNPs with univariate
   effects. We empirically confirm that the stability of GSS and GBOOST
   were not affected by removal of univariately significant SNPs. These
   results suggest that the GSS and GBOOST tests are successfully targeting
   bivariate association with phenotype and that GSS is able to reliably
   detect a larger set of SNP-pairs than GBOOST in the majority of the data
   we analysed. However, the chi(2) test for association was confounded by
   main effects.

AB Background The triarchic model of psychopathy characterizes the disorder
   in terms of three distinguishable phenotypic facets: disinhibition,
   meanness and boldness. The present study sought to (1) inform current
   debates regarding the role of boldness in the definition of psychopathy
   and (2) clarify boundaries between psychopathy and antisocial
   personality disorder (ASPD).
   Method This study evaluated the degree to which facets of the triarchic
   model are represented in the most widely used clinical inventory for
   psychopathy, the Psychopathy Checklist - Revised (PCL-R), in comparison
   with ASPD as defined by DSM-IV criteria. Adult male offenders from two
   distinct correctional settings (n=157 and 169) were investigated to
   ensure replicability of findings across samples exhibiting high base
   rates of psychopathy and antisocial behavior.
   Results We found evidence for convergent and discriminant validity of
   the three triarchic facets in predicting symptomatic components of
   psychopathy as assessed by the PCL-R. Additionally, and crucially
   vis-a-vis current debates in the field, we found that boldness
   contributed incrementally (over and above disinhibition and meanness) to
   prediction of PCL-R psychopathy, in particular its interpersonal style
   component, but not ASPD.
   Conclusions The three distinct facets of the triarchic model of
   psychopathy are represented clearly and distinctly in the PCL-R, with

AB Network operators are increasingly competing with triple play offers
   from cable providers for both broadcast customers and telecommunications
   customers. In recent years they have invested in IPTV platforms and
   launched their own IPTV services. This has brought a new question on the
   regulatory agenda: shall network operators be obliged to offer wholesale
   access to their IPTV platform? And if yes, should the new wholesale IPTV
   product be regulated in the same way as traditional wholesale access? Or
   should traditional regulation be modified? While the majority of
   countries have so far no regulatory rules in place, some national
   regulators have started to become active in this market segment.
   In order for alternative network operators to realise multiple play
   offers including IPTV they must be able to match the offers of the
   incumbent operators. Such replicability with respect to telecoms
   infrastructure is in principle no problem as long as regulatory rules on
   local loop unbundling and related facilities are in place. But what if
   incumbent operators are neither required to offer unbundled access to
   their FTTH local loops nor do alternative network operators have access
   to sub-loop unbundling? It is for this reason that many argue some form
   of direct access to the incumbent multicast equipment needs to be
   provided. Otherwise the provision of IPTV services will be restricted to
   large network operators.
   The paper demonstrates that the regulation of wholesale access to IPTV
   depends above all on country specific conditions. Ex-ante regulation of
   access to wholesale broadband services over any DSL technology and any
   transport technology (ATM and Ethernet) in the sense that the SMP
   operator is obliged to offer a multicast functionality that allows
   competitors to offer TV services should be bound to a number of
   requirements: (1) the demand characteristics such as demand for bundled
   products. A precondition for determining regulatory obligations with
   respect to the provision of wholesale access to IPTV platforms should be
   that multiple play offers are the dominant form of providing telecom
   services. (2) The lack of cable TV operators exerting competitive
   pressure at the retail level for triple play products. (3) A lack of LLU
   in the country, so that alternative operators need a multicast WBA
   access to offer multiple play services.
   The paper is organised as follows. The first section of the paper
   briefly describes the technical and market characteristics of wholesale
   IPTV access. The second section considers the impact of IPTV wholesale
   access regulation on competition, investment and broadband diffusion.
   The third section examines regulatory issues concerning access to
   wholesale IPTV in more detail. The final section gives key
   recommendations for a regulatory strategy on wholesale broadband access
   to IPTV. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Scientists in many disciplines have begun to raise questions about the
   evolution of research findings over time (Ioannidis in Epidemiology, 19,
   640-648, 2008; Jennions & Moller in Proceedings of the Royal Society,
   Biological Sciences, 269, 43-48, 2002; Mullen, Muellerleile, & Bryan in
   Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 27, 1450-1462, 2001;
   Schooler in Nature, 470, 437, 2011), since many phenomena exhibit
   decline effects-reductions in the magnitudes of effect sizes as
   empirical evidence accumulates. The present article examines empirical
   and theoretical evolution in eyewitness identification research. For
   decades, the field has held that there are identification procedures
   that, if implemented by law enforcement, would increase eyewitness
   accuracy, either by reducing false identifications, with little or no
   change in correct identifications, or by increasing correct
   identifications, with little or no change in false identifications.
   Despite the durability of this no-cost view, it is unambiguously
   contradicted by data (Clark in Perspectives on Psychological Science, 7,
   238-259, 2012a; Clark & Godfrey in Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 16,
   22-42, 2009; Clark, Moreland, & Rush, 2013; Palmer & Brewer in Law and
   Human Behavior, 36, 247-255, 2012), raising questions as to how the
   no-cost view became well-accepted and endured for so long. Our analyses
   suggest that (1) seminal studies produced, or were interpreted as having
   produced, the no-cost pattern of results; (2) a compelling theory was
   developed that appeared to account for the no-cost pattern; (3)
   empirical results changed over the years, and subsequent studies did not
   reliably replicate the no-cost pattern; and (4) the no-cost view
   survived despite the accumulation of contradictory empirical evidence.
   Theories of memory that were ruled out by early data now appear to be
   supported by data, and the theory developed to account for early data
   now appears to be incorrect.

AB Six decades-worth of published information has shown irrefutably that
   null-hypothesis significance tests (NHSTs) provide no information about
   the reliability of research outcomes. Nevertheless, they are still the
   core of editorial decision-making in Psychology. Two reasons appear to
   contribute to the continuing practice. One, survey information suggests
   that a majority of psychological researchers incorrectly believe that p
   values provide information about reliability of results. Two, a position
   sometimes taken is that using them to make decisions has been
   essentially benign. The mistaken belief has been pointed out many times,
   so it is briefly covered because of the apparent persistence of the
   misunderstanding. The idea that NHSTs have been benign is challenged by
   seven "side-effects" that continue to retard effective development of
   psychological science. The article concludes with both a few suggestions
   about possible alternatives and a challenge to psychological researchers
   to develop new methods that actually assess the reliability of research
   findings.

AB Background
   Randomized trials of complex, non-pharmacologic interventions
   implemented in home and community settings, such as the University of
   Southern California (USC)-Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation
   Center (RLANRC) Pressure Ulcer Prevention Study (PUPS), present unique
   challenges with respect to (1) participant recruitment and retention,
   (2) intervention delivery and fidelity, (3) randomization and
   assessment, and (4) potential inadvertent treatment effects.
   Purpose
   We describe the methods employed to address the challenges confronted in
   implementing PUPS. In this randomized controlled trial, we are assessing
   the efficacy of a complex, preventive intervention in reducing the
   incidence of, and costs associated with, the development of medically
   serious pressure ulcers in people with spinal cord injury.
   Methods
   Individuals with spinal cord injury recruited from RLANRC were assigned
   to either a 12-month preventive intervention group or a standard care
   control group. The primary outcome is the incidence of serious pressure
   ulcers with secondary endpoints including ulcer-related surgeries,
   medical treatment costs, and quality of life. These outcomes are
   assessed at 12 and 24 months after randomization. Additionally, we are
   studying the mediating mechanisms that account for intervention
   outcomes.
   Results
   PUPS has been successfully implemented, including recruitment of the
   target sample size of 170 participants, assurance of the integrity of
   intervention protocol delivery with an average 90% treatment adherence
   rate, and enactment of the assessment plan. However, implementation has
   been replete with challenges. To meet recruitment goals, we instituted a
   five-pronged approach customized for an underserved, ethnically diverse
   population. In intervention delivery, we increased staff time to
   overcome economic and cultural barriers to retention and adherence. To
   ensure treatment fidelity and replicability, we monitored intervention
   protocol delivery in accordance with a rigorous plan. Finally, we have
   overcome unanticipated assessment and design concerns related to (1)
   determining pressure ulcer incidence/severity, (2) randomization
   imbalance, and (3) inadvertent potential control group contamination.
   Limitations
   We have addressed the most daunting challenges encountered in the
   recruitment, assessment, and intervention phases of PUPS. Some
   challenges and solutions may not apply to trials conducted in other
   settings.
   Conclusions
   Overcoming challenges has required a multifaceted approach incorporating
   individualization, flexibility, and persistence, as well as the ability
   to implement needed mid-course corrections.

AB Background: The current study evaluates the reliability and
   factor-structure replicability of the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis,
   Pisa, Paris and San Diego Autoquestionnaire (TEMPS-A) in its Greek
   Version.
   Methods: The TEMPS-A was administered to a convenient sample of 734
   subjects from the general Greek population (436 females; 594% and 298
   males; 40.6%). Their mean age was 40.80 +/- 11.48 years (range 25-67
   years). The analysis included the calculation of Chronbach's alpha, the
   calculation of the threshold to define dominant temperaments (+2
   standard deviations or 95th percentile), confirmatory factor analysis
   and the calculation of Pearson correlation coefficients between the
   temperament scales scores. Analysis of Covariance with age as covariate
   and post-hoc t-test was used to search for differences in temperament
   scores between males and females. Also a table of percentile values
   corresponding to a raw score was created.
   Results: Internal consistency was excellent for the various temperaments
   (0.72-0.88). The factor analysis confirmed the five factor solution as
   the best factor solution. All TEMPS items were included in the final
   version of the scale in the Greek language.
   Limitations: The study sample included subjects from the general
   population, but it is a convenient and not representative sample.
   Although the authors tried to select them on the basis of being mentally
   healthy and without a psychiatric history, there is always a degree of
   uncertainty. There is also always the possibility some of them to
   manifest a mental disorder in the future, thus being currently in a
   premorbid state.
   Conclusion: The Greek version of the TEMPS A, has good internal
   consistency and factor structure similar to what was found in other
   translations. Overall our results are in accord with the literature and
   in line with theoretical considerations as well as with empirical
   evidence. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved

AB Elucidating the fitness effects of natural genetic variants is one of
   the current major challenges in evolutionary biology. Understanding the
   interplay between genotype, phenotype and environment is necessary to
   make accurate predictions of important biological outcomes such as
   stress resistance or yield in economically important plants and animals,
   and disease in humans. Based on population frequency patterns and
   footprints of selection at the DNA level, the transposable element
   Bari-Jheh, inserted in the intergenic region of Juvenile Hormone Epoxy
   Hydrolase (Jheh) genes, was previously identified as putatively
   adaptive. However, the adaptive effect of this mutation remained
   elusive. In this work, we integrate information on transcription factor
   binding sites, available ChIP-Seq data, gene expression analyses and
   phenotypic assays to identify the functional and the mechanistic
   underpinnings of Bari-Jheh. We show that Bari-Jheh adds extra
   antioxidant response elements upstream of Jheh1 and Jheh2 genes.
   Accordingly, we find that Bari-Jheh is associated with upregulation of
   Jheh1 and Jheh2 and with resistance to oxidative stress induced by two
   different compounds relevant for natural D.melanogaster populations. We
   further show that TEs other than Bari-Jheh might be playing a role in
   the D.melanogaster response to oxidative stress. Overall our results
   contribute to the understanding of resistance to oxidative stress in
   natural populations and highlight the role of transposable elements in
   environmental adaptation. The replicability of fitness effects on
   different genetic backgrounds also suggests that epistatic interactions
   do not seem to dominate the genetic architecture of oxidative stress
   resistance.

AB Numerous experiments have been conducted in recent years on anomalous
   retroactive influences on cognition and affect (Bern, 2010), yet more
   data are needed to understand these processes precisely. For this
   purpose, we carried out an initial retro-priming study in which the
   response times of 162 participants were measured (Rabeyron and Watt,
   2010). In the current paper, we present the results of a second study in
   which we selected those participants who demonstrated the strongest
   retro-priming effect during the first study, in order to see if we could
   replicate this effect and therefore select high scoring participants. An
   additional objective was to try to find correlations between
   psychological characteristics (anomalous experiences, mental health,
   mental boundaries, trauma, negative life events) and retro-priming
   results for the high scoring participants. The retro-priming effect was
   also compared with performance on a classical priming task. Twenty-eight
   participants returned to the laboratory for this new study. The results,
   for the whole group, on the retro-priming task, were negative and
   non-significant (es = -0.25, ns) and the results were significant on the
   priming task (es = 0.63, p < 0.1). We obtained overall negative effects
   on retro-priming results for all the sub-groups (students, male,
   female). Ten participants were found to have positive results on the two
   retro-priming studies, but no specific psychological variables were
   found for these participants compared to the others. Several hypotheses
   are considered in explaining these results, and the author provide some
   final thoughts concerning psi and replicability.

AB Without a complete published description of interventions, clinicians
   and patients cannot reliably implement interventions that are shown to
   be useful, and other researchers cannot replicate or build on research
   findings. The quality of description of interventions in publications,
   however, is remarkably poor. To improve the completeness of reporting,
   and ultimately the replicability, of interventions, an international
   group of experts and stakeholders developed the Template for
   Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist and guide.
   The process involved a literature review for relevant checklists and
   research, a Delphi survey of an international panel of experts to guide
   item selection, and a face to face panel meeting. The resultant 12 item
   TIDieR checklist (brief name, why, what (materials), what (procedure),
   who provided, how, where, when and how much, tailoring, modifications,
   how well (planned), how well (actual)) is an extension of the CONSORT
   2010 statement (item 5) and the SPIRIT 2013 statement (item 11). While
   the emphasis of the checklist is on trials, the guidance is intended to
   apply across all evaluative study designs. This paper presents the
   TIDieR checklist and guide, with an explanation and elaboration for each
   item, and examples of good reporting. The TIDieR checklist and guide
   should improve the reporting of interventions and make it easier for
   authors to structure accounts of their interventions, reviewers and
   editors to assess the descriptions, and readers to use the information.

AB The paramount importance of replicating associations is well recognized
   in the genome-wide associaton (GWA) research community, yet methods for
   assessing replicability of associations are scarce. Published GWA
   studies often combine separately the results of primary studies and of
   the follow-up studies. Informally, reporting the two separate
   meta-analyses, that of the primary studies and follow-up studies, gives
   a sense of the replicability of the results. We suggest a formal
   empirical Bayes approach for discovering whether results have been
   replicated across studies, in which we estimate the optimal rejection
   region for discovering replicated results. We demonstrate, using
   realistic simulations, that the average false discovery proportion of
   our method remains small. We apply our method to six type two diabetes
   (T2D) GWA studies. Out of 803 SNPs discovered to be associated with T2D
   using a typical meta-analysis, we discovered 219 SNPs with replicated
   associations with T2D. We recommend complementing a meta-analysis with a
   replicability analysis for GWA studies.

AB Since the outbreak of the financial crisis in 2007, the level and
   volatility of the Euribor-OIS spreads have increased significantly.
   According to the literature, this variability is mainly explained by
   credit and liquidity risk premia. I provide evidence that part of the
   variability might also be explained by ambiguity in the phrasing of the
   Euribor survey. The participants in the survey are asked at what rate
   they believe interbank funds are exchanged between prime banks; given
   the lack of a clear definition of a prime bank, this question might
   leave room for subjective judgment. In particular, I find evidence that
   some of the variability of the Euribor rates might be explained by
   changes in the survey participants' perception of what a prime bank is.
   This evidence adds to the difficulties already encountered by previous
   studies in identifying and measuring exactly the determinants of the
   Euribor rates. I argue that these difficulties are at odds with the
   clarity, simplicity and replicability that should be required of a
   widely used financial benchmark.

   residual scores associated with FL/executive functions grouped under
   another factor. Bootstrapping analysis with 1,000 resamples confirmed
   stability for seven neuropsychological tests. This study provides the

AB The adoptive transfer of natural regulatory T cells (nTreg) is a new
   option to reshape undesired immune reactivity in autoimmunity and
   transplantation toward tolerance. The first clinical trials using
   adoptive transfer of polyclonal nTreg demonstrated safety and hints of
   efficacy. However, the low frequencies of antigen-specific cells among
   the pool of polyclonal nTreg and their broad antigen nonspecific
   suppression are limitations of this approach regarding efficacy and
   safety. Recently, the isolation and expansion of (allo)antigen-specific
   nTreg have successfully been achieved by using Treg-specific activation
   markers but the yield is relatively low. Here, we describe a novel good
   manufacturing practice (GMP)-compatible expansion protocol of
   alloantigen-specific nTreg based on the stimulation of nTreg by
   allogeneic activated B cells. Their functionality and specificity are
   superior compared to polyclonal nTreg both in vitro and in vivo.
   Employing an allogeneic B cell bank, designed to cover the majority of
   HLA types, allows fast GMP-compliant manufacturing for donor-specific
   nTreg for clinical application in organ and stem cell transplantation.
   TCR repertoire analyses by next generation sequencing revealed
   impressive expansion by several log-steps of even very low-abundance
   alloantigen-specific nTreg clones. This novel method offers a simple
   approach for expanding antigen-specific nTreg and is characterized by
   high replicability and easy transferability to full GMP standards.
   An allogeneic B cell bank allows fast and GMP-compatible expansion of
   even low-abundance allospecific nTreg clones, which are more potent
   suppressors of specific alloresponses than their polyclonal
   counterparts, both in vitro and in vivo.

AB Objective: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   uncovers correlated activity between spatially distinct functionally
   related brain regions and offers clues about the integrity of functional
   brain circuits in people with chronic subjective tinnitus. We chose to
   investigate auditory network connectivity, adopting and extending
   previously used analyses methods to provide an independent evaluation of
   replicability. Design: Independent components analysis (ICA) was used to
   identify coherent patterns arising from spontaneous brain signals within
   the resting-state data. The auditory network component was extracted and
   evaluated. Bivariate and partial correlation analyses were performed on
   pre-defined regions of bilateral auditory cortex to assess functional
   connectivity. Study sample: Our design carefully matched participant
   groups for possible confounds, such as hearing status. Twelve patients
   (seven male, five female; mean age 66 years) all with chronic constant
   tinnitus and eleven controls (eight male, three female; mean age 68
   years) took part. Results: No significant differences were found in
   auditory network connectivity between groups after correcting for
   multiple statistical comparisons in the analysis. This contradicts
   previous findings reporting reduced auditory network connectivity;
   albeit at a less stringent statistical threshold. Conclusions: Auditory
   network connectivity does not appear to be reliably altered by the
   experience of chronic subjective tinnitus.

AB Individual genome-wide association (GWA) studies and their meta-analyses
   represent two approaches for identifying genetic loci associated with
   complex diseases/traits. Inconsistent findings and non-replicability
   between individual GWA studies and meta-analyses are commonly observed,
   hence posing the critical question as to how to interpret their
   respective results properly. In this study, we performed a series of
   simulation studies to investigate and compare the statistical properties
   of the two approaches. Our results show that (1) as expected,
   meta-analysis of larger sample size is more powerful than individual GWA
   studies under the ideal setting of population homogeneity among
   individual studies; (2) under the realistic setting of heterogeneity
   among individual studies, detection of heterogeneity is usually
   difficult and meta-analysis (even with the random-effects model) may
   introduce elevated false positive and/or negative rates; (3) despite
   relatively small sample size, well-designed individual GWA study has the
   capacity to identify novel loci for complex traits; (4) replicability
   between meta-analysis and independent individual studies or between
   independent meta-analyses is limited, and thus inconsistent findings are
   not unexpected.

AB Open innovation research and practice recognize the important role of
   external complementors in value creation. At the same time, firms need
   to retain exclusive control over some essential components to capture
   value from their product and/or service system. This paper contributes
   to the literature by analyzing some of the trade-offs between openness
   to external value creation and closedness for internal value capture. It
   focuses on selective openness as a key variable and investigates how it
   affects value creation by external complementors, specifically the
   members of user innovation communities. Openness, it is hypothesized,
   matters to community members: The more open a product design is, the
   higher their sense of involvement in the innovation project, and the
   larger the effort they devote to it. Unlike prior literature, different
   forms and loci of openness are distinguished, specifically the
   transparency, accessibility, and replicability of different components
   of the product being developed. Hypotheses are tested based on survey
   data (n=309) from 20 online communities in the consumer electronics and
   information technology hardware industries. Multilevel regression
   analysis is used to account for clustering, and thus nonindependent
   data, at the community level. We find that openness indeed increases
   community members' involvement in the innovation project and their
   contributions to it. Interestingly, however, some forms and loci of
   openness strongly affect community perceptions and behavior, while
   others have limited or no impact. This finding suggests that, at least
   in relation to user communities, the trade-off that firms face between
   external value creation and internal value capture is softer than
   hitherto understood. Contingency factors that may be able to explain
   these patterns are advanced. For example, users are expected to value
   the form of openness that they have the capabilities and incentives to
   exploit. The findings in this paper extend the literature on selective
   openness in innovation. They emphasize the need to study the demand for
   different forms of openness at the subsystem level and align supply-side
   strategies to it. In managerial practice, a careful assessment of the
   demand for openness enables firms to successfully use selective openness
   and to effectively appropriate value from selectively open systems.

AB Background: Gait evaluation is difficult in pigs, especially when
   objective and quantitative data are needed, thus little research has
   been conducted in this species. There is considerable experience,
   however, with objective gait analysis in other species, such as horses
   and dogs. In this study, a pressure mat was used to establish baseline
   kinetic data for gait and its longitudinal development in growing,
   weaned piglets.
   Ten clinically healthy weaned piglets were trained to trot over a
   pressure mat. Measurements were performed weekly during 10 weeks,
   starting at 5 weeks of age. Four kinetic parameters were recorded for
   all four limbs: peak vertical force (PVF), load rate (LR), vertical
   impulse (VI) and peak vertical pressure (PVP). Three representative runs
   per measuring session per pig were collected. For each of the variables,
   left vs. right limb asymmetry-indices (ASI's) were calculated based on
   the average for that parameter per week. A linear mixed model was used
   to determine the influence of time (week), velocity, and limb (left vs.
   right, and fore vs. hind). Intra-class correlations were calculated to
   assess within-session replicability.
   Results: Intra-class correlations showed good within-session
   replicability. Body-weight normalized PVF (nPVF), LR (nLR), VI (nVI) and
   PVP (nPVP) were higher in the forelimbs than in the hind limbs. A higher
   velocity was associated with a higher nPVF, nLR and nPVP. All parameters
   varied between weeks. ASI of LR and VI were higher in the forelimbs than
   in the hind limbs. Velocity and time did not influence ASI of any of the
   variables.
   Conclusions: Kinetic pressure mat measurements from healthy weaned
   piglets are highly replicable within-session. However, these variables
   present a significant variability between-session, which may be due to
   conformational changes of the young, growing piglets. Velocity clearly
   influences nPVF, nLR and nPVP, and all kinetic variables have higher
   values in forelimbs than in hind limbs. As time and velocity do not
   affect ASI's, the latter are preferable tools when velocity cannot be
   controlled or when measurements are repeated over longer time intervals.
   The present study supports the use of a pressure mat as an objective way
   to analyze and quantify porcine gait.

AB While attention modification programs (AMP) have shown promise as
   laboratory-based treatments for social anxiety disorder, trials of
   internet-delivered AMP have not yielded significant differences between
   active and control conditions. To address these inconsistencies, we
   examined the moderational and mediational role of attention bias in the
   efficacy of attention training. We compared data reported by Carlbring
   et al. (2012) to an identical AMP condition, with the exception that
   participants were instructed to activate social anxiety fears prior to
   each attention training session (AMP + FACT; n = 39). We also compared
   all attention training groups to an internet-delivered
   cognitive-behavioral therapy (iCBT) condition (n = 40). Participants in
   the AMP + FACT group experienced greater reductions in social anxiety
   symptoms than both active (n = 40) and control (n = 39) groups reported
   by Carlbring et al., and did not differ in symptom reductions from the
   iCBT group. Higher attention bias predicted greater symptom reductions
   for participants who completed AMP, but not for the control group.
   Moreover, change in attention bias mediated the relationship between AMP
   group (active condition reported by Carlbring et al. versus AMP + FACT)
   and change in social anxiety symptoms. These results suggest the
   importance of interpreting findings related to symptom change in
   attention training studies in the context of bias effects. (C) 2013 The

   Proposed solutions align the incentives of all those involved in the

   significance to one of statistical power, renewing an emphasis on
   prediction and the pre-registration of hypotheses, changing the timing
   and method of peer-review, and increasing the rate at which replications
   are conducted and published. These strategies seek to unify incentives

AB Here, two studies seek to characterize a parsimonious common-denominator
   personality structure with optimal cross-cultural replicability.
   Personality differences are observed in all human populations and
   cultures, but lexicons for personality attributes contain so many
   distinctions that parsimony is lacking. Models stipulating the most
   important attributes have been formulated by experts or by empirical
   studies drawing on experience in a very limited range of cultures.
   Factor analyses of personality lexicons of nine languages of diverse
   provenance (Chinese, Korean, Filipino, Turkish, Greek, Polish,
   Hungarian, Maasai, and Senoufo) were examined, and their common
   structure was compared to that of several prominent models in
   psychology. A parsimonious bivariate model showed evidence of
   substantial convergence and ubiquity across cultures. Analyses involving
   key markers of these dimensions in English indicate that they are broad
   dimensions involving the overlapping content of the interpersonal
   circumplex, models of communion and agency, and morality/warmth and
   competence. These Big Two dimensionsSocial Self-Regulation and
   Dynamismprovide a common-denominator model involving the two most

AB Background: De Winter and Happee [1] examined whether science based on
   selective publishing of significant results may be effective in accurate
   estimation of population effects, and whether this is even more
   effective than a science in which all results are published (i.e., a
   science without publication bias). Based on their simulation study they
   concluded that "selective publishing yields a more accurate
   meta-analytic estimation of the true effect than publishing everything,
   (and that) publishing nonreplicable results while placing null results
   in the file drawer can be beneficial for the scientific collective"
   (p.4).
   Methods and Findings: Using their scenario with a small to medium
   population effect size, we show that publishing everything is more
   effective for the scientific collective than selective publishing of
   significant results. Additionally, we examined a scenario with a null
   effect, which provides a more dramatic illustration of the superiority
   of publishing everything over selective publishing.
   Conclusion: Publishing everything is more effective than only reporting
   significant outcomes.

AB Genetic reassortment between human and avian influenza viruses can
   create pandemic viruses. Influenza surveillance of pigs in Jilin
   Province, in China during 2007-2008 revealed that there were two
   distinguishable genotypes: a human-like H3N2 genotype and a
   double-reassortant genotype derived from the human H3N2 and avian H5
   viruses. In this study, viral infection potential, replication kinetics,
   and pathogenicity were compared. The solid-phase binding assay
   demonstrated that both viruses prominently maintained a preference for
   the human-type receptor and the reassortant A/swine/Jilin/37/2008
   (Sw/JL/37/08) showed relatively higher binding affinities than the
   non-reassortant A/swine/Jilin/19/2007 (Sw/JL/19/07). Replication
   kinetics showed that Sw/JL/37/08 had higher replicability in MDCK cells
   than Sw/JL/19/07. The mouse experiments clearly revealed that
   Sw/JL/37/08 had higher virulence than Sw/JL/19/07 as measured by more
   significant body weight loss, higher viral lung load, delayed viral
   clearance from lungs, and more severe pulmonary lesions. Sequence
   analysis indicated that the absence of glycosylation sites at residue
   126 of HA and 93 of NA, as well as the characteristic NS1 C-terminal PL
   residues of ESEV may account for the increased replication and
   pathogenicity of Sw/JL/37/08. These results may imply that human may
   have infection risk by the reassortant swine influenza virus and
   emphasize the necessity for enhanced viral surveillance strategies,
   which monitor reassortment events in nature to reduce the public health
   threat posed by influenza viruses with the potential for human-to-human
   transmission currently circulating in pig populations. (C) 2013 Elsevier

   contributions of component attentional processes to anxiety-linked
   biases. MacLeod and Sadler developed a novel, lexical decision task
   using negative and neutral word stimuli, to enable the independent
   measurement of attentional engagement and disengagement. Their results
   suggest that anxiety-linked attentional biases are associated with
   facilitated attentional engagement with negative information. The
   present study aimed to determine the replicability of these findings,
   with two important extensions. First, this study included positive word
   stimuli in the lexical decision task, to determine whether
   anxiety-linked attentional biases exist only towards negative
   information, or toward emotionally arousing information in general.
   Second, this study explored age-related differences in anxiety-linked
   attentional biases. Younger (N=32) and older adults (N=32) with both
   high and low trait anxiety completed the lexical decision task. The
   results suggest that heightened anxiety may be associated with a deficit
   in engaging with positive words. No age-related differences in
   anxiety-linked attentional biases were apparent.

AB The modern concept of popularity refers to what is easily comprehended
   and unsophisticated for the sake of interest. But it is likely to be
   hard to discuss popularity in classical Chinese literature, since the
   concept has not been developed yet. In premodern period, as literary
   works were in most cases composed in a literary style with poetic
   rhymes, it was nearly impossible that they gained popularity among the
   ordinary people. Furthermore, as intellectuals attached greater
   importance to the study of Yi(義) and Li(理), and the realization of the
   Confucian ideology, the literary works that pursued rhetorical
   embellishments and the preparation for state examination were considered
   low and degrading. Thus, the works that depicted the life of the common
   people in detail or expressed one’s personal sentiment could only be
   estimated properly when they were related to the study of Yi and Li. But
   in late Joseon period, as the intellectual class began to be divided
   into several groups, poor scholars who shared daily life with ordinary
   people endeavored to write without hierarchical and political notion.
   They were neither scholars with official post who were in charge of

   time using expressions of traditional written language. In this article
   the popularity in classical Chinese literature in late Josen period was
   surveyed in three aspects; ⓐhaving close connection to daily life of
   ordinary people, without hierarchical and political notion of
   traditional literature. ⓑintroducing irregular hanmun escaping from the
   old styled written hanmun. ⓒadapting poetic hanmun without rhymes,
   escaping from the regular style of poetic rhyme. The popularity emerged
   in late Josen period is different from the modern concept of popularity
   that is connected to commercialism, replicability and crudity. But it is
   also possible to say that it represents another characteristics of
   popularity in respect of persuing of the new aesthetic value of real
   life.
AK 근대에 들어와서 문학과 예술을 논할 때 일반대중의 취향에 맞추어 이해하기 쉽고 흥미 본위의 특성을 통속성이라고 부르게 되었다.
   근대 이전의 문화지식층이 주로 담당하였던 한문학을 대상으로 삼으면서 근대적 의미의 통속성을 운위하는 것은 무리가 있다.
   한국한문학에서는 기본적으로 문언어법의 한문을 사용하고 韻語를 익힌 토대 위에 창작활동을 하여야 하였으므로, 구어 사용의 대중을
   독자층으로 확보할 수가 없었다. 더구나 한국학문학의 담당층이었던 사대부 지식인은 義理之學을 우위에 두고 정치이념을 구현하는 것을
   第一義로 삼았으므로, 시문의 형식미 자체를 추구하는 文章之學과 과거 합격을 위해 연마하는 科擧之學은 저속한 공부에 불과하였다.
   따라서 백성들의 삶을 세세하게 묘사하거나 개인 정감을 표현하는 것은 그것이 의리지학에 연계되어 있거나 연계되어 있다고 확신될 때만
   가치를 인정받을 수 있었다. 이것은 근세 이후 통속의 개념이 상업성이나 복제성, 저급성이란 의미로 사용되는 것과는 달랐다. 그러나
   조선 후기에는 사 계층의 분화와 더불어 중하층 백성들과 함께 ‘생활의 장’을 살아나간 寒士들이 계층적, 정치적 이념에서 벗어난
   독자적인 문학세계를 추구하였다. 그들은 大小文字를 담당하는 館閣文人도 아니고, 동호인 집단에서 인정받는 문예적 취향의 文人도
   아니었다. 그들은 스스로의 문자 활동에 대해 자조하면서도 나름대로의 자부심을 찾아나가야 하였다. 이들의 문학은 경국문장이나
   화국문장을 정점에 두는 사대부 문학의 관점에서 보면 매우 통속적이라고 할 수 있다. 하지만 문학의 정치성과 이념성을 탈각한 면에서
   보면 그 나름대로 순문학적인 특성을 지니고 있었다고 말할 수 있다. 또한 한사들의 문학세계는 행문의 관습에서는 문언어법을
   지키면서도 생활세계에서 활용된 변격한문을 도입하여 중층적인 표현체계를 활용하였다. 본고는 조선후기의 한문학에 대두된 통속성을 다음
   세 가지 측면에서 살펴보았다. ⓐ 經國文章 혹은 華國文章이라는 계층적, 정치적 이념으로부터 일탈되어 민간생활의 場에 밀착하는
   특성. ⓑ 문언어법과 운어 형식의 구속성을 벗어나 일상생활에서 널리 사용되던 변격한문의 문학적 활용. ⓒ 운자 사용의 관습성이
   강하였던 祭文 등의 양식에서 寒士들이 無韻의 형식으로 감정을 직서하는 방식의 채용. 조선후기 한문학에서 소재, 주제사상과 문체의
   측면에서 대두된 통속성은 근세 이후 상업성이나 복제성, 저급성이란 의미에서의 통속성과는 달랐다. 하지만 한문학이 추구한
   개인적․인격적 자기수양과 책임윤리의 실현이라는 본령에서 벗어나 생활의 장에 밀착한 새로운 미학을 지향하였다는 점에서 정통
   한문학과는 다른 통속성을 드러냈다고 말할 수 있다.

AB Background: Donor engagement in transitional settings, complex
   emergencies and fragile states is increasing. Neither short-term
   humanitarian aid nor traditional development financing are well adapted
   for such environments. Multi-donor trust funds, in their current form,
   can be unwieldy and subject to long delays in initiation and work best
   when national governments are already strong. We reviewed the aid
   modalities used in Zimbabwe through the period of crisis, 2008-2012 and
   their results and implications. Literature review and case experience
   was utilised. Discussion: By focusing on working with line ministries in
   non-contested sectors to determine local priorities rather than
   following global prescriptions, pooling funds to achieve scale rather
   than delivering through fragmented projects, and building on national
   systems and capacities rather than setting up parallel mechanisms, the
   Transition Fund Model employed in Zimbabwe by UNICEF and partners in
   partnership with the Inclusive Government was able to achieve important
   results in health, education, social support and water services in a
   challenging setting. In addition, forums for collaboration were
   developed that provided a platform for further action. The initial
   emphasis on service delivery diffused much of the political delicateness
   that impeded progress in other sectors. The Zimbabwean experience may
   provide a model of innovative financing for countries facing similar
   circumstances. Summary Such models may represent a new practical
   application of the Paris Principles, consistent with the major tenets of
   the 2011 New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States agreed in Busan. As
   we approach the Millennium Development Goal deadline, an over-arching,
   mutli-sectoral and independent evaluation of this approach is
   recommended in order to validate findings and assess broader
   replicability of this approach.

   NOVELTY - The method involves presenting a device-appropriate
   application user interface responsive to a document object model (DOM)
   structure by an abstraction layer. A user input is received from a
   rendered application user interface by a mobile application. An input
   event is received (106) from the abstraction layer by programming code
   referenced by the DOM. The DOM is reconfigured to reflect response by
   the application to the input in response to the received input event.
   The application user interface is updated by the abstraction layer
   responsive to the reconfiguring of the DOM.
   USE - Method for enabling provisioning and execution of a
   platform-independent application by using a client device. Uses include
   but are not limited to a cellphone, personal digital assistant (PDA),
   laptop computer and a desktop computer i.e. IBM personal computer.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables addressing and updating a defined portion
   of the application in response to application events without
   necessitating update of the application and propagating appearance and
   behavior of the application with consistency across heterogeneous device
   types so as to enable cross-device interoperability, replicability and
   compatibility of applications and data with consistency of user
   experience. The method enables designing the DOM such that mapping
   between data and behavior can remain the same across implementations of
   simple operating system (OS) to ensure that superstructure and
   applications operating in accordance with the superstructure retain
   consistent look and feel. The method enables avoiding need to maintain
   records of precisely which client devices receive information, so that
   the client devices are more free to leave and re-join a network without

AB The ability to repeat an experiment, known as replicability, is a basic
   concept of scientific research and also an important aspect in the field
   of eScience. The principles of Service Oriented Computing (SOC) and
   Cloud Computing, both based on high runtime dynamicity, are more and
   more adopted in the eScience domain. Simulation experiments exploiting
   these principles introduce significant challenges with respect to
   replicability. Current research activities mainly focus on how to
   exploit SOC and Cloud for eScience, while the aspect of replicability
   for such experiments is still an open issue. In this paper we define a
   general method to identify points of dynamicity in simulation
   experiments and to handle them in order to enable replicability. We
   systematically examine different types of service binding strategies,
   the main source of dynamicity, and derive a method and corresponding
   architecture to handle this dynamicity with respect to replicability.
   Our work enables scientists to perform simulation experiments that
   exploit the dynamicity and flexibility of SOC and Cloud Computing but
   still are repeatable.

AB Objective A Quantitative PCR method was established for detecting Human
   Bocavirus ( B19)and applied on the validation process indicating the
   removal of virus. Using this method and nanometer membrane filtration,
   the effect of virus removal on the productive process of blood products
   was evaluated. Methods Using the following primers, ( P1) 5'-GGC ACC TCT
   CAA AAC ACT -3'and (P2) 5'-GCA GTC CTT GCT GAT ACT C -3', at 95℃ for 3
   minutes,at 95℃ for 10 seconds,at 52℃ for 10 seconds, and at 72℃ for 10
   seconds,40 cycles were amplified respectively in each condition. The
   QPCR method used to detect B19 concentration in samples was established
   with the validation of its specificity, replicability and sensitivity.
   Last, this method was used to evaluate the effect of B19 removal in
   blood products with nanometer membrane filtration. Results Both intra
   and inter-assay of the methods have shown precision within <5% in count.
   The lowest detectable limit was 50 copies/muL. The titers of samples
   treated by nanometer membrane filtration descended by 3. 89logs.
   Conclusion A QPCR method with good specificity,replicability and
   sensitivity was successfully established and provides a theoretical
   foundation for the rapid and accurate detection of B19 and the
   validation of virus removal process.

AB Objective To investigate the feasibility of the dissolution method in
   distilled water instead of methylene blue soluble plasma, and to test
   the validation of methylene blue method for inactivating virus in serum
   content in order to study the quality control in blood drawing stations
   in accordance with the technical procedures (2012 edition) ( hereinafter
   referred to as" regulations" ) on Appendix F-19. Methods A known
   concentration of methylene blue was collected in standards after the
   colorimetric solid-phase extraction. An aqueous solution containing a
   known concentration of methylene blue was collected by the solid-phase
   colorimetric extraction method. A known concentration of methylene blue
   with 1% acetic acid and methanol solution was collected by direct
   colorimetric method. Three sets of numerical data were compared to
   investigate the effects of methylene blue in the operation of the
   solid-phase extraction. Results Using the colorimetric method, 1 to 5
   mumoL/L of 1% methylene blue acetate methanol solution was directly
   compared by the differences in color. Then , a solution containing 1 to
   5 mumoL/L methylene blue solution, a solution containing 1 to 5 mumoL/L
   methylene blue plasma obtained through the Waters Oasis HLB column
   solid-phase extraction, and a methanol solution containing 1 % acetic
   acid were compared with a colorimetric spectrophotometer. The results
   were compared to methylene blue at 92. 9% of the extraction rate. The
   linearity was satis-factory. Conclusion Using the solid-phase extraction
   spectrophotometer method to detect methylene blue, the methylene
   bluecontent had a favorable recovery rate and replicability. Hence,the
   Central Asian's routine quality control method is effective and feasible
   to detect the methylene blue content in virus-inactivated plasma. The
   dissolution of methylene blue in plasma after extraction or in distilled
   water/1 % acetic acid and methanol resulted in the same concentration of
   methylene blue. The values of methylene blue were close to the matching
   T-test value of 0.010 2,with P <0. 05,indicating that there was no
   statistically significant difference between the two values. The results
   suggest that when plasma is in shortage, distilled water or 1% acetic
   acid in methanol can substitute for blood plasma to detect the release
   of methylene blue contents.

   levels substantially lower than those of the original PIV data. We
   compare hybrid algorithms combining PTV (particle tracking velocimetry)
   and DNS with three different degrees of fidelity: the
   POD-Galerkin-projection approach, the proportional feedback of
   time-resolved PTV data, and the feedback based on the extended Kalman
   filter. By solving a planar-jet problem as an example, we analyze the
   temporal- and spatial-filtering functions as well as the accuracy of
   velocity and pressure fields reconstructed from the PTV data. The
   results demonstrate that we can lower the measurement-noise levels and
   improve the accuracy/replicability by increasing the computational cost.

AB BACKGROUND: Achievement goal theory helps us understand what motivates
   students to participate in educational activities. However, measuring
   achievement goals in a precise manner is problematic. Elliot and
   McGregor's Achievement Goal Questionnaire (AGQ) and Elliot and
   Murayama's revised Achievement Goal Questionnaire (AGQ-R) are widely
   used to assess students' achievement goals. Both instruments were
   developed and validated using undergraduate psychology students in the
   USA.
   METHODS: In this study, our aims were to first of all, assess the
   construct validity of both questionnaires using a cohort of Australian
   pharmacy students and, subsequently, to test the generalizability and
   replicability of these tools more widely in schools of pharmacy in other
   English-speaking countries. The AGQ and the AGQ-R were administered
   during tutorial class time. Confirmatory factor analysis procedures,
   using AMOS 19 software, were performed to determine model fit.
   RESULTS: In contrast to the scale developers' findings, confirmatory
   factor analysis supported a superior model fit for the AGQ compared with
   the AGQ-R, in all countries under study.
   CONCLUSION: Validating measures of achievement goal motivation for use
   in pharmacy education is necessary and has implications for future
   research. Based on these results, the AGQ will be used to conduct future
   cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of the achievement goals of
   undergraduate pharmacy students from these countries.

AB Groundwater resources continue to be an important source of water supply
   for communities in developing countries. However, rapid population
   growth and urbanization, challenges the potential of groundwater to
   serve and meet the needs of growing populace. Various techniques have
   been developed over the last decade to assess groundwater vulnerability
   due changes in climate and prevailing natural environmental conditions.
   The difficulty in most of these methods has been intensive data
   requirements. This paper developed an innovative method called f-hydra
   index using three key parameters - flow accumulation (derived from
   Digital Elevation Model), landcover map and hydraulic conductivity. The
   results of the index were successfully evaluated with widely used index
   - DRASTIC (for the Densu River Basin of Ghana, West Africa). The
   comparison of f-hydra to DRASTIC shows highly correlated areas in
   mapping vulnerable regions in the study area. The f-hydra index proves a
   noble way to assess groundwater vulnerability to pollution in data
   scarce regions. Authors envisaged the testing of the model in many other
   regions to ascertain it's replicability globally.

AB BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the psychometric
   properties of Social Capital Questionnaire ( SCQ) developed by Onyx and
   Bullen (2000) among a sample of medical science students in Tehran
   University of Medical Sciences, Iran and to compare the factor analysis
   with findings from two previous studies in Australia and the United
   States.
   METHODS: Multistage cluster sampling was employed to recruit 293 medical
   science students (Male: 95/Female: 198) from 7 faculties in Tehran
   University of Medical Sciences. After translating SCQ into Persian
   applying back-translation technique and three-stage consensus panel, the
   questionnaires administered to the respondents and they were asked to
   complete them. Statistical Analysis was performed using SPSS version
   16.0 for Windows.
   RESULTS: Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was conducted to evaluate
   factor structure of the Persian SCQ (PSCQ),which showed a moderate
   replicability, validity, and reliability (Cronbach alpha= .79) to those
   found in previous studies. Twelve factors extracted with eight values
   greater than 1 which altogether accounted for 76.23% of the total
   variance. Applying Cattell's scree test, it was indicated that between
   seven and eight factor sextracted. The correlations between factors were
   detected in the low (at the lowest 0.002) to modest (at the highest
   0.614) range.
   CONCLUSION: The differences found in the factor analysis between the
   studies may be ascribed to the various types of populations studied.
   Despite the difference in populations studied, our findings support the
   meaningful nessof P-SCQ as an instrument that is worthy of further
   attention for use in social health researches, although more studies are
   recommended to help researchers in comparing its variety in dimensions
   of different communities.

   the phenomenon being studied, and in terms of the mechanics of such an
   ambitious replication project. Replication attempts like this one are
   clearly valuable and will continue to inform our science. We discuss a
   number of lessons we have taken from the process related to the divide
   between direct and conceptual replication, and whether the data can
   inform our current theory regarding the original effect. In discussing
   these issues, we advocate for transparent flexibility in data analyses
   and the involvement of the original authors at every stage of the

AB As part of their Many Labs project Klein et al. (2014) replicated the
   effects of an imagined contact study carried out by Husnu and Crisp
   (2010). In their report the authors argue the data provides weak support
   for replicability. However, the effect observed was both significant and
   comparable to that obtained from a recent meta-analysis for the relevant
   outgroup. This suggests that the Many Labs project may provide stronger
   support for the existence of imagined contact effects than currently
   thought. We discuss the value in interpreting replications within the
   context of the existing literature.

AB Objectives: Examine the reliability of sociodemographic variables in
   predicting initiation of breastfeeding within an hour of birth
   (EarlyBF), using data from 1998, 2003 and 2008-2009.
   Study design: A replication analysis using the Kenya Demographic and
   Health Survey (KDHS) data collected in 1998, 2003 and 2008-2009. The
   candidate predictor variables were child's gender, home or health
   facility place of birth, vaginal or caesarean mode of birth, urban or
   rural setting, province of residence, Wealth Index and maternal
   education, occupation, literacy and media exposure.
   Setting: Kenya.
   Participants: 6375 dyads of mothers aged 15-49 and their children aged
   0-23 months (2125 dyads in each of the survey years).
   Results: Mode of birth and province were statistically significant
   predictors of EarlyBF in 1998, 2003 and 2008-2009. Children delivered
   through caesarean section were non-EarlyBF in 1998 (OR 2.63, 95% CI 1.72
   to 4.04), 2003 (OR 3.36, 95% CI 1.83 to 6.16) and 2008 (OR 3.51, 95% CI
   2.17 to 5.69). The same was true of those living in the Western province
   in 1998 (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.61 to 4.43), 2003 (OR 4.92, 95% CI 3.01 to
   8.04) and 2008 (OR 6.07, 95% CI 3.54 to 10.39).
   Conclusions: The 1998 KDHS data do not provide the basis for reliable
   prediction of EarlyBF, with reliability conceptualised as replicability
   of findings using highly similar data sets from 2003 and 2008-2009. Most
   of the demographic and socioeconomic variables were unreliable
   predictors of EarlyBF. We speculate that activities in parts or all of
   Kenya changed the analysis context in the period between 1998 and
   2008-2009, and these changes were of a sufficient magnitude to affect
   the relationships under investigation. The degree to which this is a
   general problem in child health research is not known, calling for
   further research to investigate this methodological issue with other
   health end points and other data.

AB Limnology has been greatly influenced by The lake as a Microcosm
   (Forbes, 1887), which described a holistic focus on the internal
   machinations of singular, island-like aquatic ecosystems. I consider
   three persistent influences of The lake as a Microcosm: as an organizing
   paradigm for the teaching of limnology relative to its practice; the
   idea that inland waters are like islands, and the replicability of types
   of inland waters. Based on inspection of recent peer-reviewed literature
   and 32 limnology texts, we teach limnology according to Forbes but do
   not practice it in that holistic context. Instead, we practice limnology
   as aquatic ecology. Based on novel analyses of species-area
   relationships for 275 inland waters and 392 islands, inland waters are
   more like continental habitat patches than islands; the island metaphor
   is poetic but not accurate. Based on a quantitative review of beta
   diversity (40 data sets representing 10,576 inland waters and 26 data
   sets representing 1529 terrestrial sites), aquatic systems are no more
   replicable than are terrestrial systems; a typological approach to
   limnology is no more justified than it is in terrestrial systems.
   I conclude that a former distinction between limnology and aquatic
   ecology no longer applies, and that we should define limnology as the
   ecology of inland waters. Also, we should not consider lakes and rivers
   as islands that represent other systems of the same type, but should
   consider them as open, interactive habitat patches that vary according
   to their geology and biogeography. I suggest modern limnology operates
   according to 3 paradigms, which combine to form 3 broad limnological
   disciplines and establish a basis for a plural, interactive view of
   lakes and rivers as microcosms. This model of modern limnology may help
   better connect it to ecology and biogeography and help limnology be even
   more relevant to science and society

AB In my doctoral thesis, I overviewed that the implication of
   non-delegation doctrine in the Unites of States has transformed as
   becoming administrative state and, now, this doctrine becomes to be
   found in administrative law through due-process principle. In that
   thesis, I examined the non-delegation doctrine based on due-process
   principle. To achieve it, I considered it from three points of view:
   substantial due-process under which a delegation is not proper unless
   the legislature impose substantial restriction on agencies discretion
   enough to guarantee that such discretion is not limitless; structural
   due-process under which the person incurring damages from the act of
   agencies will be given an opportunity to have courts' judicial review on
   constitutionality of such delegation; and procedural due-process under
   which governmental agencies exercise their legislative rights by
   supplementing legitimacy through deliberation and participation. Under
   the structural due-process, in this paper, I put the judicial branch,
   monitoring legitimacy of delegation, and the executive branch,
   requesting for judicial deference to their interpretation, in equal
   position. And then, based on the assumption that the structure of the
   Constitution itself where a judicial review is to be expected justifies
   legislative delegation, I explore who is the best institution to
   interpret, that is to say, what competence is required, or who has the
   competence like that. For this, I introduce the Institutional Tern
   theory under which dogmatism and formalism of jurisprudence are
   criticized and the law must become reflexive and bottom-up. In spite of
   their differences, most of supporters of the theory assert that the
   judicial branch should defer to the interpretation of the executive
   because of its competence as responsibility and expertise. Depending on
   the type of public interest the social community desires to have, the
   legacy of legislation and its implementation would be the form of either
   industrial regulation and environment-friendly or industrial
   deregulation and environmental development. In terms of this, in this
   paper, I state my view that the role of courts is to strike balance of
   them and the values of legal system of the followings should be
   considered as standards to be applied by the courts at the moment:
   predictability; replicability; systemic consistency; responsiveness;
   justice; fairness; doctrinal stability; social congruence; social value
   formation, and so on. In doing so, we can recognize that the
   consideration of institutional competence and value of legal system is
   posted in the course of balancing between the judicial branch and
   executive branch as per changes in social and environmental context,
   since they go along with the history of justification model of
   administrative state.
AK 미국의 입법권 위임금지법리가 오늘날 행정국가화 현상과 더불어 변용되어 이제는 듀ㆍ프로세스를 통해 행정법상에서 찾아볼 수 있게
   되었다. 학위 논문에서는 이러한 듀ㆍ프로세스법리를 세 가지 관점으로 나누어 살펴보고 있다. 즉, 의회는 행정기관의 재량이 무제한인
   것은 아님을 보증하기에 충분한 실체적인 제약을 두지 않으면 위임이 적절한 것으로서 인정되지 않는다고 하는 실체적 듀ㆍ프로세스,
   위임시에는 행정기관의 입법담당자에게는 중요한 정치적 책임이 동반되기 때문에 행정기관의 행위로 피해를 입은 경우에는 사법심사를 통해
   그 위임의 합헌성을 심사받을 기회가 주어진다고 하는 의미에서의 구조적 듀ㆍ프로세스, 마지막으로 행정기관이 숙고와 참여로 정당성을
   보완하는 절차를 통해 그 입법권을 행사한다고 하는 절차적 듀ㆍ프로세스라는 3가지로 나누어 현대행정국가에 있어서의 위임금지법리의
   의미를 재검토하고자 했다. 이글은 그중에서도 구조적 듀ㆍ프로세스에서는 사법심사가 예정되어 있다고 하는 헌법구조 그 자체가 행정에
   입법권을 위임하는 것을 정당화한다고 하는 구조를 전제로 그 통제의 주체인 사법부와 사법부에 겸양을 요구하는 행정부를 동등하게
   두고, 해석의 적임자는 누구인가, 즉 해석에 있어서의 각 부문(제도)의 적성을 고찰했다. 이를 위해, 사법의 도그마티즘이나
   형식주의를 비판하여 법은 응답적이고 보텀ㆍ업적인 것이지 않으면 안된다고 하는 제도전회론을 소개하고 있다. 제도전회론의 지지자들은
   조금씩 차이는 있지만 오늘날 행정부의 책임성과 전문성이라는 제도적성을 판단기준으로 할 때, 사법은 행정의 해석에 겸양하지 않으면
   안된다고 하는 것을 주장의 요지로 하고 있다. 입법과 그 집행의 결과는 그 사회공동체가 바라고 있는 공익은 어떤 것인가에 의해
   산업규제강화나 친환경적인 형태로 나타나는 것도, 산업규제완화나 환경개발적인 형태로 나타나는 것도 가능할 것이다. 이에 대해서는
   어떤 일방으로 치우치지 않도록 양방향의 균형을 맞추는 것이 법원의 역할이고, 그 기준으로서 제도의 적성에 못지않게 예견가능성,
   반복가능성, 일관성, 응답성, 공정성, 공평성, 안정성, 사회의 조화, 사회적 가치의 형성과 같은 법시스템 그 자체가 가지고 있는
   가치가 고려되지 않으면 안된다고 하는 논의를 소개했다. 다만, 제도적성과 법시스템적 가치의 고려는 행정국가의 정당화모델의 역사와
   그 흐름을 함께하고 있다는 점에서 사회문맥과 환경의 변화에 따른 사법부와 행정부의 균형잡기과정에서 행해지고 있음을 알 수 있고,
   해석의 주도권을 어디에 갖게 할 것인가는 그 사회의 수준과 놓여져 있는 상황에 따라 판단되어야 할 것이다.

AB Objectives: High-quality reporting of treatment details can aid
   replication of study results in real-world clinical practice. The
   Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture
   (STRICTA) is a reporting guideline for key elements of acupuncture
   interventions in clinical trials. This study used STRICTA to investigate
   whether Cochrane reviews of acupuncture adequately report important
   treatment details.
   Design: Systematic review Methods: Cochrane reviews of acupuncture were
   identified from The Cochrane Library (issue 7, 2012). Randomised
   controlled trials (RCTs) included in the reviews and published after
   2005 were obtained. Using STRICTA, we extracted acupuncture-related
   information from the Cochrane reviews and the RCTs. The characteristics
   of the included studies' table were the major source of intervention
   information from Cochrane reviews. Reporting quality of acupuncture
   interventions in Cochrane reviews was assessed and compared with the
   respective RCTs.
   Results: 25 Cochrane reviews of acupuncture and 92 RCTs met the
   selection criteria. Cochrane reviews were 16% less likely to report the
   acupuncture-related items of STRICTA than RCTs (risk ratio 0.84, 95% CI
   0.79 to 0.88, I-2=8%). Information was significantly better reported for
   10 of the 15 treatment-group items of STRICTA in RCTs than in Cochrane
   reviews (p<0.05), while four items did so without statistical
   significance. One item related to practitioner background was
   significantly better reported in Cochrane reviews.
   Conclusions: Reporting quality of treatment details in Cochrane reviews
   of acupuncture was insufficient with regard to STRICTA, even though such
   information was readily reported in RCTs. The overall quality of
   reporting of the RCTs, while better than the reviews, was also often
   suboptimal. Use of STRICTA guideline during the review process is
   recommended to adequately report the key treatment components in
   Cochrane reviews of acupuncture. The potential impact of STRICTA to the
   replicability and utilisation of reviews in future research and practice
   needs to be investigated.

AB High-index-contrast optical devices form the backbone of densely
   integrated photonic circuits. While these devices are traditionally
   fabricated using lithography and etching, their performance is often
   limited by defects and sidewall roughness arising from fabrication
   imperfections. This paper reports a versatile, roll-to-roll and backend
   compatible technique for the fabrication of high-performance,
   high-index-contrast photonic structures in composition-engineered
   chalcogenide glass (ChG) thin films. Thin film ChG have emerged as
   important materials for photonic applications due to their high
   refractive index, excellent transparency in the infrared and large Kerr
   non-linearity. Both thermally evaporated and solution processed As-Se
   thin films are successfully employed to imprint waveguides and
   micro-ring resonators with high replicability and low surface roughness
   (0.9 nm). The micro-ring resonators exhibit an ultra-high quality-factor
   of 4 x 10(5) near 1550 nm wavelength, which represents the highest value
   reported in ChG micro-ring resonators. Furthermore, sub-micron
   nanoimprint of ChG films on non-planar plastic substrates is
   demonstrated, which establishes the method as a facile route for
   monolithic fabrication of high-index-contrast devices on a wide array of
   unconventional substrates.

AB Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) are learning platforms within
   universities aiming to facilitate and enhance students' learning. In
   order to increase the chances for success of VLEs implementation it is
   essential to identify the factors which influence the students' decision
   making as far as accepting and using VLEs are concerned. In this paper
   we are applying one of the most popular models, the so-called Unified
   Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model developed by
   Venkatesh et al. (2003) to identify and test the underlying factors
   influencing VLE acceptance and use. UTAUT is a relatively new model
   sparsely applied in cross-cultural settings and in the context of Higher
   Education (Straub, 2009). We are testing the model in four business
   schools in universities in three different countries: the UK, Russia and
   Jordan. The results show that although all items from the original UTAUT
   questionnaire have their place in the final groupings obtained through
   the factor analysis, the `clean' agglomeration of items into groups
   shown by the original paper and a few others could not be replicated in
   the individual countries or in the overall sample despite the good
   sample size obtained in our study. The paper raises a question about the
   replicability of the original results and calls for reconsideration of
   the way the model is applied.

   are rare in psychology. This research tested variation in the
   replicability of 13 classic and contemporary effects across 36
   independent samples totaling 6,344 participants. In the aggregate, 10
   effects replicated consistently. One effect - imagined contact reducing
   prejudice - showed weak support for replicability. And two effects -
   flag priming influencing conservatism and currency priming influencing
   system justification - did not replicate. We compared whether the
   conditions such as lab versus online or US versus international sample
   predicted effect magnitudes. By and large they did not. The results of
   this small sample of effects suggest that replicability is more
   dependent on the effect itself than on the sample and setting used to

AB Schnall, Benton, and Harvey (2008) hypothesized that physical
   cleanliness reduces the severity of moral judgments. In support of this
   idea, they found that individuals make less severe judgments when they
   are primed with the concept of cleanliness (Exp. 1) and when they wash
   their hands after experiencing disgust (Exp. 2). We conducted direct
   replications of both studies using materials supplied by the original
   authors. We did not find evidence that physical cleanliness reduced the
   severity of moral judgments using samples sizes that provided over .99
   power to detect the original effect sizes. Our estimates of the overall
   effect size were much smaller than estimates from Experiment 1 (original
   d = -0.60, 95% CI [-1.23, 0.04], N = 40; replication d = -0.01, 95% CI
   [-0.28, 0.26], N = 208) and Experiment 2 (original d = -0.85, 95% CI
   [-1.47, -0.22], N = 43; replication d = 0.01, 95% CI [-.34, 0.36], N =
   126). These findings suggest that the population effect sizes are
   probably substantially smaller than the original estimates. Researchers
   investigating the connections between cleanliness and morality should
   therefore use large sample sizes to have the necessary power to detect
   subtle effects.

AB Eyal, Liberman, and Trope (2008) established that people judged moral
   transgressions more harshly and virtuous acts more positively when the
   acts were psychologically distant than close. In a series of conceptual
   and direct replications, Gong and Medin (2012) came to the opposite
   conclusion. Attempting to resolve these inconsistencies, we conducted
   four high-powered replication studies in which we varied temporal
   distance (Studies 1 and 3), social distance (Study 2) or construal level
   (Study 4), and registered their impact on moral judgment. We found no
   systematic effect of temporal distance, the effect of social distance
   consistent with Eyal et al., and the reversed effect of direct construal
   level manipulation, consistent with Gong and Medin. Possible
   explanations for the incompatible results are discussed.

AB Replication is at the heart of all empirical sciences. However, there
   are no standard procedures for establishing the replicability of a
   pattern of correlations found linking a particular variable to an
   inventory or battery of other measures. This article introduces 2
   statistics for quantifying the expected replicability of a pattern of
   associations (i.e., correlations, slope coefficients) between a variable
   of interest and a SET of other variables, items, measures, and so on.
   Using simulations and real data, we illustrate that these statistics are
   highly accurate estimates of the expected replicability of an observed
   pattern of correlations. These statistics can readily be used to
   indicate the replicability of patterns of association indexed by other
   statistics (e.g., regression slopes or covariances) and can be applied
   to other contexts, such as estimating the reliability of profile
   correlations. It is recommended that these statistics are regularly
   reported in such studies.

AB High-index-contrast optical devices form the backbone of densely
   integrated photonic circuits. While these devices are traditionally
   fabricated using lithography and etching, their performance is often
   limited by defects and sidewall roughness arising from fabrication
   imperfections. This paper reports a versatile, roll-to-roll and backend
   compatible technique for the fabrication of high-performance,
   high-index-contrast photonic structures in composition-engineered
   chalcogenide glass (ChG) thin films. Thin film ChG have emerged as
   important materials for photonic applications due to their high
   refractive index, excellent transparency in the infrared and large Kerr
   non-linearity. Both thermally evaporated and solution processed As-Se
   thin films are successfully employed to imprint waveguides and
   micro-ring resonators with high replicability and low surface roughness
   (0.9 nm). The micro-ring resonators exhibit an ultra-high quality-factor
   of 4 times 10 5 near 1550 nm wavelength, which represents the highest
   value reported in ChG micro-ring resonators. Furthermore, sub-micron
   nanoimprint of ChG films on non-planar plastic substrates is
   demonstrated, which establishes the method as a facile route for
   monolithic fabrication of high-index-contrast devices on a wide array of
   unconventional substrates.

AB Objectives The objective of this study was to assess whether National
   Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment
   (HTA)-funded randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in the HTA
   journal were described in sufficient detail to replicate in practice.
   Setting RCTs published in the HTA journal.
   Participants 98 RCTs published in the HTA journal up to March 2011.
   Completeness of the intervention description was assessed independently
   by two researchers using a checklist, which included assessments of
   participants, intensity, schedule, materials and settings. Disagreements
   in scoring were discussed in the team; differences were then explored
   and resolved.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures Proportion of trials rated as
   having a complete description of the intervention (primary outcome
   measure). The proportion of drug trials versus psychological and
   non-drug trials rated as having a complete description of the
   intervention (secondary outcome measures).
   Results Components of the intervention description were missing in 68/98
   (69.4%) reports. Baseline characteristics and descriptions of settings
   had the highest levels of completeness with over 90% of reports
   complete. Reports were less complete on patient information with 58.2%
   of the journals having an adequate description. When looking at
   individual intervention types, drug intervention descriptions were more
   complete than non-drug interventions with 33.3% and 30.6% levels of
   completeness, respectively, although this was not significant
   statistically. Only 27.3% of RCTs with psychological interventions were
   deemed to be complete, although again these differences were not
   significant statistically.
   Conclusions Ensuring the replicability of study interventions is an
   essential part of adding value in research. All those publishing
   clinical trial data need to ensure transparency and completeness in the
   reporting of interventions to ensure that study interventions can be
   replicated.

   confirmatory factor and invariance analysis to item level data from the

   sample (N = 5,130) and a validation sample (N = 5,131). Using standard
   assessments of model fit, all primary factors displayed good to
   excellent model fit, thus suggesting the scales to be broadly
   unidimensional. Results indicated a drop in model fit in both the
   structural and configurally invariant second order models, suggesting
   some level of misspecification in the global scales of Extraversion,
   Anxiety, Tough-Mindedness, Independence, and Self-Control. However, the
   degree of misspecification was slight. Overall, the analyses generally
   supported the proposed structure of the 16PF5.

AB A field survey with a sample of 98 households was carried out in
   Chaganbulige, Siziwang Banner, Inner Mongolia in order to understand
   herdsmens perception of climate change and compare it with
   meteorological data and the official record of extreme climate events.
   The results showed that most herdsmen correctly perceived the change in
   temperature, but they had inexact judgement on precipitation, wind and
   sandstorm. In the past 40 years, temperature in Siziwang Banner was
   slowly increasing. The precipitation and storms were fluctuating
   greatly, but the long-term trend did not change much though most
   herdsmen reported that the rainfall was significantly decreasing. Recent
   years of extreme climate events impressed herdsmen most. As to the
   impacts of extreme climate events, drought was most impressive to
   herders followed by snowstorms and sandstorms. For adapting to climate
   change herdsmen had spontaneously taken various adaptive measures, of
   which 22 adaptation measures were reported in the survey. The top five
   measures that were used by most herdsmen are storing more hay and
   forage, reducing the herd size, building warm shed, borrowing money
   (loan), and not let next generations be herders. Others include building
   corral, digging well, planting fodder, cooperation in vaccinations of
   cattle, reducing household expenditures, changing grazing location,
   renting grassland, introducing new breeds, savings, wage labor, giving
   up herding, alternative livelihoods (e.g. tourism), sharing herding
   arrangement, etc. The 22 spontaneous adaptation measures were assessed
   by experts with the method of multiple criteria analysis (MCA). The
   criteria include effectiveness, economic benefits, flexibility,
   no-regret, side-effect, compliance with government policies and plans,
   compatibility with development goals, and replicability. The results
   showed that building warm shed, the introduction of new breeds, hay and
   forage storage, reducing the herd size and wage labor met the most
   criteria. The spontaneous adaptation measures were further screened by
   herdsmen, researchers, and local government officials with the
   participatory method. The results showed that measures such as building
   warm shed, introduction of new breeds, hay and forage storage, reducing
   the herd size and loan were more effective than others, which did not
   totally coincide with the results of expert assessment. To support the
   spontaneous adaptation measures which were selected to be most practical
   and effective, the herders identified the following policies that were
   mostly needed, i.e. loan support, the improvement of social security,
   accurate weather forecasts and pest forecasts, animal insurance,
   training, market access enhancement, enhancement of infrastructure, warm
   shed subsidies and drinking water project. Those policies would improve
   herdsmens ability of adapting to climate change, help herdsmen to cope
   with extreme climate events, and reduce their vulnerability of
   livelihoods.

AB Zhong and Liljenquist (2006) reported evidence of a Macbeth Effect in

   literally, to cleanse themselves. In an attempt to build upon these
   findings, we conducted a series of direct replications of Study 2 from
   Z&L's seminal report. We used Z&L's original materials and methods,
   investigated samples that were more representative of the general
   population, investigated samples from different countries and cultures,
   and substantially increased the power of our statistical tests. Despite
   multiple good-faith efforts, however, we were unable to detect a Macbeth

AB Background: Gait evaluation is difficult in pigs, especially when
   objective and quantitative data are needed, thus little research has
   been conducted in this species. There is considerable experience,
   however, with objective gait analysis in other species, such as horses
   and dogs. In this study, a pressure mat was used to establish baseline
   kinetic data for gait and its longitudinal development in growing,
   weaned piglets. Ten clinically healthy weaned piglets were trained to
   trot over a pressure mat. Measurements were performed weekly during 10
   weeks, starting at 5 weeks of age. Four kinetic parameters were recorded
   for all four limbs: peak vertical force (PVF), load rate (LR), vertical
   impulse (VI) and peak vertical pressure (PVP). Three representative runs
   per measuring session per pig were collected. For each of the variables,
   left vs. right limb asymmetry-indices (ASI's) were calculated based on
   the average for that parameter per week. A linear mixed model was used
   to determine the influence of time (week), velocity, and limb (left vs.
   right, and fore vs. hind). Intra-class correlations were calculated to
   assess within-session replicability. Results: Intra-class correlations
   showed good within-session replicability. Body-weight normalized PVF
   (nPVF), LR (nLR), VI (nVI) and PVP (nPVP) were higher in the forelimbs
   than in the hind limbs. A higher velocity was associated with a higher
   nPVF, nLR and nPVP. All parameters varied between weeks. ASI of LR and
   VI were higher in the forelimbs than in the hind limbs. Velocity and
   time did not influence ASI of any of the variables. Conclusions: Kinetic
   pressure mat measurements from healthy weaned piglets are highly
   replicable within-session. However, these variables present a
   significant variability between-session, which may be due to
   conformational changes of the young, growing piglets. Velocity clearly
   influences nPVF, nLR and nPVP, and all kinetic variables have higher
   values in forelimbs than in hind limbs. As time and velocity do not
   affect ASI's, the latter are preferable tools when velocity cannot be
   controlled or when measurements are repeated over longer time intervals.
   The present study supports the use of a pressure mat as an objective way
   to analyze and quantify porcine gait.

AB Concerns have been raised recently about the replicability of behavioral
   priming effects, and calls have been issued to identify priming
   methodologies with effects that can be obtained in any context and with
   any population. I argue that such expectations are misguided and
   inconsistent with evolutionary understandings of the brain as a
   computational organ. Rather, we should expect priming effects to be
   highly sensitive to variations in experimental features and subject
   populations. Such variation does not make priming effects frivolous or
   capricious but instead can be predicted a priori. However, absent
   theories specifying the precise contingencies that lead to such
   variation, failures to replicate another researcher's findings will
   necessarily be ambiguous with respect to the inferences that can be
   made. Priming research is not yet at the stage where such theories
   exist, and therefore failures are uninformative at the current time.
   Ultimately, priming researchers themselves must provide direct
   replications of their own effects; researchers have been deficient in
   meeting this responsibility and have contributed to the current state of
   confusion. The recommendations issued in this article reflect concerns
   both with the practice of priming researchers and with the inappropriate
   expectations of researchers who have failed to replicate others' priming
   effects.

   reproducibility of psychological research. This article argues that the
   alleged crisis of replicability is primarily due to an epistemological
   misunderstanding that emphasizes the phenomenon instead of its
   underlying mechanisms. As a consequence, a replicated phenomenon may not
   serve as a rigorous test of a theoretical hypothesis because identical
   operationalizations of variables in studies conducted at different times
   and with different subject populations might test different theoretical
   constructs. Therefore, we propose that for meaningful replications,
   attempts at reinstating the original circumstances are not sufficient.
   Instead, replicators must ascertain that conditions are realized that
   reflect the theoretical variable(s) manipulated (and/or measured) in the
   original study.

AB Reproducibility is the cornerstone of science. If an effect is reliable,
   any competent researcher should be able to obtain it when using the same
   procedures with adequate statistical power. Two of the articles in this
   special section question the value of direct replication by other
   laboratories. In this commentary, I discuss the problematic implications
   of some of their assumptions and argue that direct replication by
   multiple laboratories is the only way to verify the reliability of an

AB A decade of research has demonstrated the explanatory potential of
   interplay between genetic variants and environmental factors in the
   development of common mental disorders. Initial findings have undergone
   tests of replicability and specificity. Some gene-environment
   interactions have been confirmed, some have not replicated and yet other
   turned out to be more specific than initially thought. Specific and
   complementary roles of genetic factors have been delineated: a common
   functional length polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene
   (5-HTTLPR) moderated the effect of childhood maltreatment on chronic
   depression in adulthood, but did not substantially influence the effects
   of adult stressful life events on the onset of new depressive episodes;
   in contrast, a common functional polymorphism in the brain-derived
   neurotrophic factor gene (BDNF) moderated the effect of stressful life
   events in adulthood in triggering new depressive episodes, but did not
   influence the effects of childhood maltreatment. Molecular mechanisms
   underlying gene-environment interactions are being uncovered, including
   DNA methylation and other epigenetic modifications. New gene-environment
   interactions continue to be reported, still largely from
   hypothesis-driven research. Statistical and biological prioritization
   strategies are proposed to facilitate a systematic discovery of novel
   gene-environment interactions in genome-wide analyses.

AB Buildings worldwide account for nearly 40% of global energy consumption.
   The biggest energy consumer in buildings is the Heating, Ventilation and
   Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. HVAC also ranks top in terms of number
   of complaints by tenants. Maintaining HVAC systems in good conditions
   through early fault detection is thus a critical problem. The problem,
   however, is difficult since HVAC systems are large in scale, consisting
   of many coupling subsystems, building and equipment dependent, and
   working under time-varying conditions. In this paper, a model-based and
   data-driven method is presented for robust system-level fault detection
   with potential for large-scale implementation. It is a synergistic
   integration of: ) Statistical Process Control (SPC) for measuring and
   analyzing variations; 2) Kalman filtering based on gray-box models to
   provide predictions and to determine SPC control limits; and (3) system
   analysis for analyzing propagation of faults' effects across subsystems.
   In the method, two new SPC rules are developed for detecting sudden and
   gradual faults. The method has been tested against a simulation model of
   the HVAC system for a 420-meter-high building. It detects both sudden
   faults and gradual degradation, and both device and sensor faults.
   Furthermore, the method is simple and generic, and has potential
   replicability and scalability.
   Note to Practitioners-HVAC systems work under time-varying weather and
   cooling load, and it is therefore difficult to detect faults. In
   addition, the various devices of HVAC systems require the detection
   method simple and robust so that it has good replicability and
   scalability. A gray-box model-based and data-driven method is developed
   in this paper. It is a novel combination of SPC, Kalman filter, and
   system analysis. By measuring and analyzing variations of model
   parameters, a fault can be detected when it causes these parameters to
   deviate from their normal ranges. The method detects both sudden and
   gradual faults with high detection rate and low false alarm rate. It
   also detects effects of faults in one subsystem on another to help
   detect and confirm device faults.

AB PurposeTo identify regional network covariance patterns of gray matter
   associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to further evaluate its
   replicability and stability.
   Materials and MethodsThis study applied a multivariate analytic approach
   based on scaled subprofile modeling (SSM) to structural magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) data from 19 patients with AD and 19 healthy
   controls (HC). We further applied the derived covariance patterns to
   examine the replicability and stability of AD-associated covariance
   patterns in an independent dataset (13 AD and 14 HC) acquired with a
   different scanner.
   ResultsThe AD-associated covariance patterns identified from SSM
   combined principal components mainly involved the temporal lobe and
   parietal lobe. The expression of covariance patterns was significantly
   higher in AD patients than HC (t((36))=5.84, P=5.75E-7) and predicted
   the AD/HC group membership (84% sensitivity and 90% specificity). In
   replicability evaluation, the expression of the forward applied
   covariance patterns was still statistically significant and had
   acceptable discriminability (69% sensitivity and 71% specificity).
   ConclusionAD patients showed regional gray matter alterations in a
   reliable covariance manner. The results suggest that SSM has utility for
   characterizing covariant features, and therefore can assist with further
   understanding covariance patterns of gray matter in AD based on the view
   of the network. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2014;39:143-149. (c) 2013 Wiley

AB Community Reserves and Conservation Reserves illustrate a

   protected area (PA) network of India. Such reserves mark a shift towards
   an inclusive and decentralised approach within PAs in the country. Three
   such reserves in southern India: the Aghanashini Lion-tailed Macaque
   Conservation Reserve, Kadalundi-Vallikunnu Community Reserve and
   Thirupaddaimaradur Conservation Reserve, were selected to examine the
   reasons for their creation, management and stakeholder dynamics, with an
   aim to review their productivity and potential replicability. The study
   was carried out through semi-structured interviews with Forest
   Department officials, local community members and researchers working in
   the three reserves. Insufficient interaction between the stakeholders
   appeared to be a common issue in two reserves. The functioning of the
   reserves was also influenced, and in some cases negatively affected, by
   local politics. Financial stability was crucial in the functioning of
   reserves, as was consistency in interaction and appropriate monitoring
   of management plans. These elements are recommended for sustaining such
   reserves and creating community-based management systems for
   conservation, to support an inclusive approach to PA management.

   the selection of hypotheses to be examined in the follow-up study as
   well as when there is no division of roles into the primary and the
   follow-up study. We show that existing meta-analysis methods are not
   appropriate for this problem, and suggest novel methods instead. We
   prove that our multiple testing procedures control for appropriate error
   rates. The suggested family-wise error rate controlling procedure is
   valid for arbitrary dependence among the test statistics within each
   study. A more powerful procedure is suggested for false discovery rate
   (FDR) control. We prove that this procedure controls the FDR if the test
   statistics are independent within the primary study, and independent or
   have positive dependence in the follow-up study. For arbitrary
   dependence within the primary study, and either arbitrary dependence or
   positive dependence in the follow-up study, simple conservative
   modifications of the procedure control the FDR. We demonstrate the
   usefulness of these procedures via simulations and real data examples.

   independent samples. This interaction was significant in 4 of the 5
   samples and a combined sample and approached significance in the fifth
   sample. In contrast, the NE x PE x EC interaction was unrelated to

AB Trait anxiety is a unitary construct reflecting individual differences
   in the tendency to experience anxious symptomatology, typically measured
   with questionnaires such as the Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory
   (STAI-T). Recent research by Rudaizky, Page, and MacLeod has found
   evidence that two different dimensions of trait anxiety account for
   independent variance in trait anxiety scores. These dimensions are
   anxiety reactivity (AR), reflecting the probability of experiencing an
   anxious reaction, and anxiety perseveration (AP), reflecting the
   persistence of anxious symptoms once elicited. There are two key issues
   addressed in this study: first, the replicability of Rudaizky etal.'s
   findings and second, the ability of the measures of AR and AP developed
   by Rudaizky etal. to predict independent variance in STAI-T scores after
   statistically controlling for variance shared with a measure of
   depression. Regression analysis determined that AR and AP do account for
   independent variance in STAI-T trait anxiety scores even after
   statistically controlling for depression. The implications of these
   findings for the understanding of anxiety vulnerability are discussed.

AB Forests provide several ecosystem services and its presence near streams
   can increase water quality and quantity. In human-dominated landscapes
   such as agricultural lands, the forests are usually limited to a few
   patches. To improve the protection of water ways in these areas, we
   propose a methodological framework to: (i) assess the contribution of
   water-related ecosystem services offered by the present forest
   vegetation in the landscape, and (ii) prioritize areas for recovery and
   restoration actions. The methodology is based on a balance between local
   demand (physical variables) and supply (forest characteristics) of
   water-related services. This balance has the advantage of showing the
   amount of forest that currently has potential to provide services and
   the areas with higher deficit of services. Although this method still
   needs to be validated, its simplicity and easy replicability makes our
   methodology a rapid assessment of forest potential to provide
   water-related ecosystem services within agricultural areas.

AB Introduction: Due to the budget limitations, laboratories mostly rely on
   the manufacturers' information about the influence of interfering
   substances on laboratory results. However, some manufacturers do not
   follow the recommended procedures for testing interferences (CLSI
   standard) and there is a great variability in the presentation of data
   regarding lipemia interference.
   Materials and methods: We aimed to verify the manufacturers'
   specifications for lipemia interference for clinical chemistry reagents
   provided by Beckman Coulter, Roche and Siemens. Bias was determined
   using the Intralipid simulated lipemic samples. Furthermore, we aimed to
   compare obtained data with the manufacturers' claims and desirable
   specification for imprecision derived from biological variation.
   Results: i) Manufacturers' declarations were not confirmed for all three
   manufacturers; ii) the magnitude and direction of the effect of lipemia
   on laboratory results differ substantially between the three tested
   analytical systems; and iii) manufacturers are using arbitrary limits in
   declaring the expected effect of interference on laboratory results.
   Conclusions: There is an urgent need to standardize the way
   manufacturers test and report their data on the lipemia interference. We
   propose that, instead of arbitrary limits, manufacturers use evidence
   based quality specifications for assessing the allowable biases.
   Moreover, laboratories should be aware of the possible lack of
   replicability of manufacturers' declarations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

AB BackgroundStandardized patients (SPs) are frequently included in the
   clinical preparation of students in the health sciences. An acknowledged
   benefit of using SPs is the opportunity to provide a standardized method
   by which students can demonstrate and develop their competency.
   Relatively little is known, however, about the capacity of SPs to offer
   an accurate and standardized performance across a speech-language
   therapy student cohort.
   AimsTo investigate the accuracy, reproducibility (consistent performance
   of each SP across student interviews) and replicability (consistent
   performance of a number of SPs across each scenario) of SPs portraying
   three scenarios, each as a parent of a child presenting with a speech
   disorder.
   Methods & ProceduresForty-four speech-language therapy students
   interviewed four SPs to gain a case history. All interviews were
   videotaped. The accuracy of SP portrayal of key features of each
   scenario was scored by an expert rater and two other raters. Data were
   analysed to determine levels of accuracy, reproducibility and
   replicability, and inter-rater reliability was evaluated.
   Outcomes & ResultsSPs were found to have moderate to high levels of
   accuracy across the three scenarios. There were no significant
   differences in the performances of each individual SP across interviews
   or between all SPs on each scenario, indicating that reproducibility and
   replicability were achieved. Overall inter-rater reliability between
   raters across all scenarios was greater than 80%.
   Conclusions & ImplicationsThe results would seem to indicate that SPs
   can present in a standardized manner within a speech-language therapy
   context, confirming the value of their inclusion in clinical education
   programmes. Suggestions for improving the training of SPs in order to
   maintain accuracy are highlighted.

AB The global health burden engendered by human immunodeficiency virus
   (HIV)-induced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a sobering
   reminder of the pressing need for a preventative vaccine. In non-human
   primate models replicating adenovirus (Ad)-HIV/SIV recombinant vaccine
   vectors have been shown to stimulate potent immune responses culminating
   in protection against challenge exposures. Nonetheless, an increase in
   the transgene carrying capacity of these Ad vectors, currently limited
   to approximately 3000 base pairs, would greatly enhance their utility.
   Using a replicating, E3-deleted Ad type 5 host range mutant (Ad5 hr)
   encoding full-length single-chain HIV(BaL)gp120 linked to the D1 and D2
   domains of rhesus macaque CD4 (rhFLSC) we systematically deleted the
   genes encoding early region 4 open reading frame 1 (E4orf1) through
   E4orf4. All the Ad-rhFLSC vectors produced similar levels of viral
   progeny. Cell cycle analysis of infected human and monkey cells revealed
   no differences in virus-host interaction. The parental and E4-deleted
   viruses expressed comparable levels of the transgene with kinetics
   similar to Ad late proteins. Similar levels of cellular immune responses
   and transgene-specific antibodies were elicited in vaccinated mice.
   However, differences in recognition of Ad proteins and induced antibody
   subtypes were observed, suggesting that the E4 gene products might
   modulate antibody responses by as yet unknown mechanisms. In short, we
   have improved the transgene carrying capacity by one thousand base pairs
   while preserving the replicability, levels of transgene expression, and
   immunogenicity critical to these vaccine vectors. This additional space
   allows for flexibility in vaccine design that could not be obtained with
   the current vector and as such should facilitate the goal of improving
   vaccine efficacy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report
   describing the effects of these E4 deletions on transgene expression and
   immunogenicity in a replicating Ad vector.

AB The promise of `big data' has generated a significant deal of interest
   in the development of new approaches to research in the humanities and
   social sciences, as well as a range of important critical interventions
   which warn of an unquestioned rush to `big data'. Drawing on the
   experiences made in developing innovative `big data' approaches to
   social media research, this paper examines some of the repercussions for
   the scholarly research and publication practices of those researchers
   who do pursue the path of `big data'-centric investigation in their
   work. As researchers import the tools and methods of highly
   quantitative, statistical analysis from the `hard' sciences into
   computational, digital humanities research, must they also subscribe to
   the language and assumptions underlying such `scientificity'? If so, how
   does this affect the choices made in gathering, processing, analysing,
   and disseminating the outcomes of digital humanities research? In
   particular, is there a need to rethink the forms and formats of
   publishing scholarly work in order to enable the rigorous scrutiny and
   replicability of research outcomes?

AB Less-invasive biomarkers for early Alzheimer disease (AD) are urgently
   needed. The present study aimed to establish a panel of plasma proteins
   that accurately distinguishes early AD from physiological aging and to
   compare the findings with previous reports. Fifty-eight healthy controls
   (CON) and 109 patients with AD dementia were randomly split into a
   training (40%) and a test (60%) sample. Significant proteins to
   differentiate between the CON and AD dementia groups were identified in
   a comprehensive panel of 107 plasma analytes in the training sample; the
   accuracy in differentiating these 2 groups was explored in the test
   sample. A set of 5 plasma proteins was identified, which differentiated
   between the CON group and the AD dementia group with a sensitivity of
   89.36% and a specificity of 79.17%. A biological pathway analysis showed
   that 4 of 5 proteins belonged to a common network with amyloid precursor
   protein and tau. Apolipoprotein E was the only protein that was both
   significant in the present report and in a previous proteomic study. The
   study provides a piece of evidence in support of the feasibility of a
   blood-based biomarker approach in AD diagnostics; however, further
   research is required because of issues with replicability.

AB Objective. There is an unacceptable delay in the diagnosis of axial
   spondyloarthritis (axSpA) in its early stages among patients at high
   risk, in particular those with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our
   objectives were to develop a sensible and reliable questionnaire to
   identify undetected axSpA among patients with IBD.
   Methods. Literature was reviewed for item generation in the Toronto
   axSpA Questionnaire on IBD (TASQ-IBD). Sensibility of the questionnaire
   was assessed among healthcare professionals and patients. This
   assessment was related to purpose and framework (clinical function,
   clinical justification, and clinical applicability), face validity,
   comprehensiveness [oligo-variability (limiting the questionnaire to
   important items) and transparency], replicability, content validity, and
   feasibility. The test-retest reliability study was administered to 77
   patients with established IBD and axSpA. Kappa agreement coefficients
   and absolute agreement were calculated for items.
   Results. Three domains included IBD, inflammatory back symptoms, and
   extraaxial features. The entry criterion required a patient to have IBD
   and back pain or stiffness that ever persisted for >= 3 months.
   Iterative sensibility assessment involved 16 items and a diagram of the
   back. Kappa coefficients ranged from 0.81-1.00 for each item. Absolute
   agreement across all items ranged from 91% to 100%.
   Conclusion. TASQ-IBD is a newly developed, sensible, and reliable
   case-finding questionnaire to be administered to patients with IBD who
   have ever had chronic back pain or stiffness persisting for >= 3 months.
   It should facilitate identification and timely referral of patients with
   IBD to rheumatologists and minimize the delay in diagnosis of axSpA.
   Consequently, it should assess the prevalence of axSpA in IBD.

AB This paper reports recent developments in Rapfish, a normative, scalable
   and flexible rapid appraisal technique that integrates both ecological
   and human dimensions to evaluate the status of fisheries in reference to
   a norm or goal. Appraisal status targets may be sustainability,
   compliance with a standard (such as the UN code of conduct for
   responsible fisheries) or the degree of progress in meeting some other
   goal or target. The method combines semi-quantitative (e.g. ecological)
   and qualitative (e.g. social) data via multiple evaluation fields, each
   of which is assessed through scores assigned to six to 12 attributes or
   indicators: the scoring method allows user flexibility to adopt a wide
   range of utility relationships. For assessing sustainability, six
   evaluation fields have been developed: ecological, technological,
   economic, social, ethical and institutional. Each field can be assessed
   directly with a set of scored attributes, or several of the fields can
   be dealt with in greater detail using nested subfields that themselves
   comprise multidimensional Rapfish assessments (e.g. the hierarchical
   institutional field encompasses both governance and management,
   including a detailed analysis of legality). The user has the choice of
   including all or only some of the available sustainability fields. For
   the attributes themselves, there will rarely be quantitative data, but
   scoring allows these items to be estimated. Indeed, within a normative
   framework, one important advantage with Rapfish is transparency of the
   rigour, quality and replicability of the scores. The Rapfish technique
   employs a constrained multidimensional ordination that is scaled to
   situate data points within evaluation space. Within each evaluation
   field, results may be presented as a two-dimensional plot or in a
   one-dimensional rank order. Uncertainty is expressed through the
   probability distribution of Monte-Carlo simulations that use the c.l. on
   each original observation. Overall results of the multidisciplinary
   analysis may be shown using kite diagrams that compare different
   locations, time periods (including future projections) and management
   scenarios, which make policy trade-offs explicit. These enhancements are
   now available in the R programming language and on an open website,
   where users can run Rapfish analyses by downloading the software or
   uploading their data to a user interface. (C) 2013 The Authors Journal

AB The use of integrated tasks is increasingly common in second language
   assessment in both high stakes and classroom contexts. However, because
   of the vague definition of what constitutes an integrated task, the
   types of tasks included in this area and the assessment of the resulting
   writing is highly varied. In this paper, we argue for a better
   definition of the term 'integrated writing task'. We start by reviewing
   current definitions available in the literature, discuss the construct
   underlying integrated tasks and then propose a number of features which
   we feel need to be present in integrated tasks. We then propose a new,
   narrower definition of the term. We hope that this will result in better
   task design, improved assessment outcomes for test takers, more detailed
   test specifications, better replicability of research and a shared
   research agenda. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This protocol includes the designs and software necessary to upgrade an

   instrument for around $1,000 (excluding a drill), using industry
   standard stepper motors and CNC controlling software. Each axis has
   variable speed control and may be operated simultaneously or
   independently. The robot's flexibility and open coding system (g-code)
   make it capable of performing custom tasks that are not supported by
   commercial systems. Its applications include, but are not limited to,
   drilling holes, sharp edge craniotomies, skull thinning, and lowering
   electrodes or cannula. In order to expedite the writing of g-coding for
   simple surgeries, we have developed custom scripts that allow
   individuals to design a surgery with no knowledge of programming.
   However, for users to get the most out of the motorized stereotax, it
   would be beneficial to be knowledgeable in mathematical programming and
   G-Coding (simple programming for CNC machining).
   The recommended drill speed is greater than 40,000 rpm. The stepper
   motor resolution is 1.8 degrees/Step, geared to 0.346 degrees/Step. A
   standard stereotax has a resolution of 2.88 degrees m/step. The maximum
   recommended cutting speed is 500 mu m/sec. The maximum recommended
   jogging speed is 3,500 mu m/sec. The maximum recommended drill bit size
   is HP 2.

AB We present new data on the prevalence and patterning of the maxillary
   premolar accessory ridge (MxPAR), a common but understudied
   morphological dental trait that is expressed as a linear elevation
   extending from the buccal cusp ridge to the medial sulcus of maxillary
   premolar teeth. A total of 579 sets of dental casts, representing six
   ethnic groups, were scored using the five-grade system proposed by
   Burnett et al. (2010). The frequency and distribution of the MxPAR were
   determined by tooth type, sex, side, locus and ethnicity, and the
   applicability of the scoring system was assessed. The MxPAR was found in
   approximately two-thirds of premolar teeth, more often on second than
   first premolars, and more often on the distal aspect of the occlusal
   surface than the mesial. There was some evidence that more pronounced
   forms of the feature occurred more often in males than females, and that
   there may be some directionality in its expression between sides.
   Variation was also noted in the frequency of occurrence and degree of
   expression of the MxPAR between ethnic groups. Intra- and inter-observer
   concordance rates for scoring the MxPAR were low, confirming that it was
   difficult to score the trait identically on two different occasions. Our
   findings have clarified the distribution of the MxPAR within the
   dentition and between ethnic groups, and highlighted the need for
   researchers to carry out thorough replicability studies and to decide on
   an appropriate breakpoint for determining presence or absence of this
   feature before embarking on genetic studies or bio-distance analyses.

AB In this article, we address the current state and general role of
   replication in empirical sciences in general and music psychology in
   particular. We argue that replication should be an integral part of the
   quality management of science because it helps to improve and maintain
   the general benefit of empirical sciences by enhancing the confidence in
   scientific phenomena and theories. Replicating empirical experiments has
   two major benefits: (1) It increases the sheer number of observations
   and (2) it provides independent evidence which works as a safety net
   against methodological fallacies, causally influential but unknown
   (i.e., random) factors, researcher degrees of freedom, and outright
   fraud. Furthermore, we argue that for low-gain/low-cost sciences such as
   music psychology, measures to ensure quality standards, in particular
   the amount of replication experiments conducted, can be expected to be
   lower than in high gain/high cost sciences. These lower expectations
   stem from the general acknowledgments that in low-gain/low-cost sciences
   (1) research resources are normally scarce and (2) the consequences of
   inadequate theories are relatively harmless. We argue that the view of
   music psychology as a low-cost/low-gain science can explain the striking
   lack of replication studies and meta-analyses. We also discuss possible
   counter-measures to enhance the reliability of music-psychological
   knowledge.

   probability. Incidentally, the problem also shows that rational
   decision-making requires the consideration of future events. We show
   that nave responses to the problem of points are more future oriented
   and thus more rational in this sense when the problem itself is
   presented in a future frame instead of the canonical past frame. A
   simple nudge is sufficient to make decisions more rational. We consider

   American (58%) and White (42%) urban dwellers living above (49%) and
   below (51%) 125% of the federal poverty line. The NEO-PI-R, administered
   via telephone, was evaluated for data quality (percent valid,
   acquiescence, internal consistency), congruence with the normative
   factor structure, and readability. All indices of data quality and
   factor congruence were excellent in the full sample. Literacy was the
   most consistent predictor of data quality. A slightly worse structure
   was found for the Openness to Experience and Extraversion factors among
   lower socioeconomic status African American and White participants. The
   overall index of factor congruence, however, supports replication of the
   normative structure well beyond chance levels even among those with
   lower literacy. Despite the challenges of low literacy, the present
   findings indicate that personality traits can be assessed reliably in

AB This article explores an agenda towards post-carbon cities, extending
   and deepening established debates around low-carbon, sustainable cities
   in the process. The label post-carbon builds upon issues beyond those of
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy conservation and climate change,
   adding a broader set of concerns, including economic justice, behaviour
   change, wellbeing, land ownership, the role of capital and the state,
   and community self-management. The article draws upon a case study of an
   embryonic post-carbon initiative completed in early 2013 called Lilac.
   Based in Leeds, Lilac stands for Low Impact Living Affordable Community
   and is the first attempt to build an affordable, ecological cohousing
   project in the UK. Its three aspects each respond to significant
   challenges: low-impact living and the challenge of post-carbon value
   change; affordability and the challenge of mutualism and equality; and
   community and the challenge of self-governance. I conclude the article
   by exploring six lessons from Lilac that tentatively outline a roadmap
   towards post-carbon cities: the need for holistic approaches that deal
   with complex challenges, prioritizing self-determination rather than
   just participation, engaging with productive political tensions,
   adopting a process rather than an outcomes-based approach, developing
   strategy for replicability, and finally, embracing a non-parochial
   approach to localities.

AB Rule learning algorithms, for example, RIPPER, induces univariate rules,
   that is, a propositional condition in a rule uses only one feature. In
   this paper, we propose an omnivariate induction of rules where under
   each condition, both a univariate and a multivariate condition are
   trained, and the best is chosen according to a novel statistical test.
   This paper has three main contributions: First, we propose a novel
   statistical test, the combined 5 x 2 cv t test, to compare two
   classifiers, which is a variant of the 5 x 2 cv t test and give the
   connections to other tests as 5 x 2 cv F test and k-fold paired t test.
   Second, we propose a multivariate version of RIPPER, where support
   vector machine with linear kernel is used to find multivariate linear
   conditions. Third, we propose an omnivariate version of RIPPER, where
   the model selection is done via the combined 5 x 2 cv t test. Our
   results indicate that 1) the combined 5 x 2 cv t test has higher power
   (lower type II error), lower type I error, and higher replicability
   compared to the 5 x 2 cv t test, 2) omnivariate rules are better in that
   they choose whichever condition is more accurate, selecting the right
   model automatically and separately for each condition in a rule.

   volumes to identify differences in structural interactions among core
   DMN regions in structural MRI data from 80 AD patients and 101 normal
   controls (NC). Compared to NC, the structural interactions between the

   (ITC) and the right hippocampus (HP), were significantly reduced in the
   AD group. In addition, the AD group showed prominent increases in
   structural interactions from the left ITC to the left HP, the left HP to
   the right ITC, the right HP to the right ITC, and the right IPC to the
   posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). The BN models significantly
   distinguished AD patients from NC with 87.12% specificity and 81.25%
   sensitivity. We then used the derived BN models to examine the
   replicability and stability of AD-associated BN models in an independent
   dataset and the results indicated discriminability with 83.64%
   specificity and 80.49% sensitivity. The results revealed that the BN
   analysis was effective for characterising regional structure
   interactions and the AD-related BN models could be considered as valid
   and predictive structural brain biomarker models for AD. Therefore, our
   study can assist in further understanding the pathological mechanism of
   AD, based on the view of the structural network, and may provide new
   insights into classification and clinical application in the study of AD
   in the future.

AB The effect of mild depression on time estimation and production was
   investigated. Participants made both magnitude estimation and magnitude
   production judgments for five time intervals (specified in seconds) from
   3 sec to 65 sec. The parameters of the best fitting psychophysical
   function (power law exponent, intercept, and threshold) were determined
   individually for each participant in every condition. There were no
   significant effects of mood (high BDI, low BDI) or judgment (estimation,
   production) on the mean exponent, n = .98, 95% confidence interval
   (.96-1.04) or on the threshold. However, the intercept showed a
   'depressive realism' effect, where high BDI participants had a smaller
   deviation from accuracy and a smaller difference between estimation and
   judgment than low BDI participants. Accuracy bias was assessed using
   three measures of accuracy: difference, defined as psychological time
   minus physical time, ratio, defined as psychological time divided by
   physical time, and a new logarithmic accuracy measure defined as In
   (ratio). The In (ratio) measure was shown to have approximately normal
   residuals when subjected to a mixed ANOVA with mood as a between groups
   explanatory factor and judgment and time category as repeated measures
   explanatory factors. The residuals of the other two accuracy measures
   flagrantly violated normality. The mixed ANOVAs of accuracy also showed
   a strong depressive realism effect, just like the intercepts of the
   psychophysical functions. There was also a strong negative correlation
   between estimation and production judgments. Taken together these
   findings support a clock model of time estimation, combined with
   additional cognitive mechanisms to account for the depressive realism
   effect. The findings also suggest strong methodological recommendations.

   recently developed for the differentiation of hES/iPS cells into the
   authentic human striatal projection medium spiny neurons (MSNs) that die
   in Huntington's Disease (HD). Authenticity is judged by the convergence
   of multiple features within individual cells. Our procedure lasts 80
   days and couples neural induction via BMP/TGF-beta inhibition with
   exposure to the developmental factors sonic hedgehog (SHH) and dickkopf1
   (DKK-1) to drive ventral telencephalic specification, followed by
   terminal differentiation [1]. Authenticity of the resulting neuronal
   population is monitored by the appearance of FOXG1(+)/GSX2(+) progenitor
   cells of the lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) at day 15-25 of
   differentiation, followed by appearance of CTIP2-, FOXP1- and
   FOXP2-positive cells at day 45. These precursor cells then mature into
   MAP2(+)/GABA(+) neurons with 20 % of them ultimately co-expressing the
   DARPP-32 and CTIP2 diagnostic markers and carrying electrophysiological
   properties expected for fully functional MSNs.The protocol is
   characterized by its replicability in at least three human pluripotent
   cell lines. Altogether this protocol defines a useful platform for in
   vitro developmental neurobiology studies, drug screening, and

AB On forested paths, dendrogeomorphology has been demonstrated to
   represent a powerful tool to reconstruct past activity of avalanches, an
   indispensable step in avalanche hazard assessment. Several quantitative
   and qualitative approaches have been shown to yield reasonable event
   chronologies but the question of the completeness of tree-ring records
   remains debatable. Here, we present an alternative semi-quantitative
   approach for the determination of past snow avalanche events. The
   approach relies on the assessment of the number and position of
   disturbed trees within avalanche paths as well as on the intensity of
   reactions in trees. In order to demonstrate that no bias was induced by
   the dendrogeomorphic expert, we cany out a statistical evaluation
   (Classification and Regression Trees, or CART) of the approach. Results
   point to the consistency and replicability of the procedure and to the
   fact that the approach is not restricted to the identification of
   high-magnitude avalanches. Evaluation of the semi-quantitative approach
   is illustrated on a well-documented path in Chamonix, French Alps. For
   the period 1905-2010, comparison between the avalanche years recorded in
   a substantial database (Enquete Permanente sur les Avalanches, or EPA)
   and those defined with dendrogeomorphic techniques shows that the
   avalanche record reconstructed from tree-ring series contains 38% of the
   observed events.

   implementation of a proper diet. Therefore nutritional epidemiology
   studies, which correlate the intake of specific nutrients, food items,
   or dietary patterns with health outcomes, receive substantial interest
   in the media. However, the results of many nutritional epidemiology
   studies have not been replicated in subsequent studies. This paper
   reviews the primary methodological problems in nutritional epidemiology
   that result in lack of replicability and inconsistency across studies.
   The problematic methodological issues include substantial measurement
   error, confounding, the variable effects of food items, variable
   reference groups, interactions, and multiple testing.

AB Palliative care in the U.S. has evolved from a system primarily reliant
   on community-based hospices to a combined model that includes inpatient
   services at most large hospitals. However, these two dominant approaches
   leave most patients needing palliative care-those at home (including
   nursing homes) but not yet ready for hospice-unable to access the
   positive impacts of the palliative care approach. We propose a
   community-based palliative care (CPC) model that spans the array of
   inpatient and outpatient settings in which palliative care is provided
   and links seamlessly to inpatient care; likewise, it would span the full
   trajectory of advanced illness rather than focusing on the period just
   before death. Examples of CPC programs are developing organically across
   the U.S. As our understanding of CPC expands, standardization is needed
   to ensure replicability, consistency, and the ability to relate
   intervention models to outcomes. A growing body of literature examining
   outpatient palliative care supports the role of CPC in improving
   outcomes, including reduction in symptom burden, improved quality of
   life, increased survival, better satisfaction with care, and reduced
   health care resource utilization. Furthermore the examination of how to
   operationalize CPC is needed before widespread implementation can be
   realized. This article describes the key characteristics of CPC,
   highlighting its role in longitudinal care across patient transitions.
   Distinguishing features include consistent care across the disease
   trajectory independent of diagnosis and prognosis; inclusion of
   inpatient, outpatient, long-term care, and at-home care delivery;
   collaboration with other medical disciplines, nursing, and allied
   health; and full integration into the health care system (rather than
   parallel delivery). J Pain Symptom Manage 2013;46:254-264. (C) 2013 U.S.

AB Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the most commonly used controller
   medications prescribed for asthma. Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms
   (SNPs), rs1876828 in corticotrophin releasing hormone receptor 1 and
   rs37973 in GLCCI1, have previously been associated with corticosteroid
   efficacy. We studied data from four existing clinical trials of
   asthmatics, who received ICS and had lung function measured by forced
   expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) before and after the period of such
   treatment. We combined the two SNPs rs37973 and rs1876828 into a
   predictive test of FEV1 change using a Bayesian model, which identified
   patients with good or poor steroid response (highest or lowest quartile,
   respectively) with predictive performance of 65.7% (P=0.039 vs random)
   area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve in the training
   population and 65.9% (P=0.025 vs random) in the test population. These
   findings show that two genetic variants can be combined into a
   predictive test that achieves similar accuracy and superior
   replicability compared with single SNP predictors.

   replicated well across countries, whereas the responsibility dimension
   of individualism of the AICS replicated poorly. Confirmatory factor
   analyses provided satisfactory support to the original theoretical
   models for both the HVIC and the AICS. Equivalence measurement indices
   indicated that the cross-cultural replicability properties of both

   and correlations between the HVIC and AICS dimensions confirm that these
   two instruments differ in their underlying meaning of the individualism
   and collectivism constructs, suggesting that these two instruments
   assess individualism and collectivism differently.

AB Functional images of the resting brain can be empirically parsed into
   intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) which closely resemble patterns
   of evoked task-based brain activity and which have a biological and
   genetic basis. Recently, ICNs have become popular for investigating
   brain functioning and brain-behavior relationships. However, the
   replicability and neurometrics of these networks are only beginning to
   be reported. Using a meta-level independent component analysis (ICA), we
   produced ICNs from three data sets collected from two samples of healthy
   adults. The ICNs from our data sets demonstrated robust and independent
   replication of 12 intrinsic networks that reflected 17 canonical,
   task-based, brain networks. We found within-subject reliability of ICNs
   was modest overall, but ranged from poor to good, and that voxels with
   the highest measured connectivity rarely had the highest reliability.
   Networks associated with executive functions, visuospatial reasoning,
   motor coordination, speech and audition, default mode, vision, and
   interoception showed moderate to high group-level reproducibility and
   replicability. However, only the first four of these networks also
   showed fair or better within-subject reliability over time. Our findings
   highlight the replicability of ICNs across data sets, the range of
   within-subject neurometrics across different networks, and the shared
   characteristics between resting and task-based networks. (C) 2013

AB The existence of seasonal or circannual effects on laboratory rodent
   behavior has been the subject of much debate in recent conversations
   with colleagues. If such effects are real, they could explain poor
   replicability or hinder the detection of treatment effects. Here, we
   review the literature in which seasonal or circannual rhythms were
   examined under typical 12:12 h photoperiods and present our historical
   data of locomotor activity of male and female Sprague-Dawley rats across
   several seasons and years. In general, there was little evidence to
   indicate significant effects on the locomotor activity of rats or mice,
   while studies of depression behaviors were somewhat inconsistent in
   their findings. Results of the few anxiety behavior assessments were
   fairly consistent, at least in rat studies. Two studies of pain-related
   behaviors indicated decreased responses during spring or summer testing.
   If such seasonal effects are real, this would imply that laboratory
   rodents have a type of internal Type 2 circannual clock or endogenous
   oscillator. However, photoperiod, temperature, or humidity cannot be the
   zeitgeber. Further, the need for a circannual clock in a short-lived
   rodent is debatable. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Currently, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the gold standard
   for detecting osteoporosis, but is not recommended for general
   population screening. Therefore, this study aims to develop an
   osteoporosis risk-assessment model to identify high-risk individuals
   among Korean postmenopausal women. Data from 1,209 and 1,046
   postmenopausal women who participated in the 2009 and 2010 Korean
   National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, respectively, were
   used for development and validation of an osteoporosis risk-assessment
   model. Osteoporosis was defined as T score less than or equal to -2.5 at
   either the femoral neck or lumbar spine. Performance of the candidate
   models and the Osteoporosis Self assessment Tool for Asians (OSTA) were
   compared with respect to sensitivity, specificity, and area under the
   receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). To compare the developed
   Korean Osteoporosis Risk-Assessment Model (KORAM) with OSTA, a net
   reclassification improvement was further calculated. In the development
   dataset, the prevalence of osteoporosis was 33.9 %. KORAM, consisting of
   age, weight, and hormone therapy, had a sensitivity of 91.2 %, a
   specificity of 50.6 %, and an AUC of 0.709 with a specific cut-off score
   of -9. Comparable results were shown in the validation dataset:
   sensitivity 84.8 %, specificity 51.6 %, and AUC 0.682. Additionally,
   risk categorization with KORAM showed improved reclassification over
   that of OSTA from 7.4 to 41.7 %. KORAM can be easily used as a
   pre-screening tool to identify candidates for DXA tests. Further studies
   investigating cost-effectiveness and replicability in other datasets are
   required to establish the clinical utility of KORAM.

   disclose four methodological design specification details that are not
   required to be disclosed under current reporting standards but that are
   critical for accurate interpretation and evaluation of reported
   findings. Grassroots sentimentas manifested in the positive and
   appreciative response to our initiativeindicates that psychologists want
   to see changes made at the systemic level regarding disclosure of such
   methodological details. Almost 50% of contacted researchers disclosed
   the requested design specifications for the four methodological
   categories (excluded subjects, nonreported conditions and measures, and
   sample size determination). Disclosed information provided by
   participating authors also revealed several instances of questionable
   editorial practices, which need to be thoroughly examined and redressed.
   On the basis of these results, we argue that the time is now for
   mandatory methods disclosure statements for all psychology journals,

AB In recent years the topic of entrepreneurship has become a major focus
   in the social sciences, with renewed interest in the links between
   personality and entrepreneurship. Taking a socioecological perspective
   to psychology, which emphasizes the role of social habitats and their
   interactions with mind and behavior, we investigated regional variation
   in and correlates of an entrepreneurship-prone Big Five profile.
   Specifically, we analyzed personality data collected from over half a
   million U.S. residents (N = 619,397) as well as public archival data on
   state-level entrepreneurial activity (i.e., business-creation and
   self-employment rates). Results revealed that an entrepreneurship-prone
   personality profile is regionally clustered. This geographical
   distribution corresponds to the pattern that can be observed when
   mapping entrepreneurial activity across the United States. Indeed, the
   state-level correlation (N = 51) between an entrepreneurial personality
   structure and entrepreneurial activity was positive in direction,
   substantial in magnitude, and robust even when controlling for regional
   economic prosperity. These correlations persisted at the level of U.S.
   metropolitan statistical areas (N = 15) and were replicated in
   independent German (N = 19,842; 14 regions) and British (N = 15,617; 12
   regions) samples. In contrast to these profile-based analyses, an
   analysis linking the individual Big Five dimensions to regional measures
   of entrepreneurial activity did not yield consistent findings.
   Discussion focuses on the implications of these findings for
   interdisciplinary theory development and practical applications.

AB The main objective of this paper is to explore the accuracy and
   repeatability of geometric morphometric techniques to describe the
   pattern of variation in artificial modifications of the skull. Our
   approach demonstrates a great descriptive capacity and the posibility of
   transforming quantitative morphological variation into continuous
   qualitative information. The variation described is continuous in the
   morpho-space of the cranial modifications, showing that the studied
   cases don not conform to naturally discrete groups.

AB ScriptingRT is a new open source tool to collect response latencies in
   online studies of human cognition. ScriptingRT studies run as Flash
   applets in enabled browsers. ScriptingRT provides the building blocks of
   response latency studies, which are then combined with generic Apache
   Flex programming. Six studies evaluate the performance of ScriptingRT
   empirically. Studies 1-3 use specialized hardware to measure variance of
   response time measurement and stimulus presentation timing. Studies 4-6
   implement a Stroop paradigm and run it both online and in the
   laboratory, comparing ScriptingRT to other response latency software.
   Altogether, the studies show that Flash programs developed in
   ScriptingRT show a small lag and an increased variance in response
   latencies. However, this did not significantly influence measured
   effects: The Stroop effect was reliably replicated in all studies, and
   the found effects did not depend on the software used. We conclude that
   ScriptingRT can be used to test response latency effects online.

AB Background: An incremental, loosely planned development approach is
   often used in bioinformatic studies when dealing with custom data
   analysis in a rapidly changing environment. Unfortunately, the lack of a
   rigorous software structuring can undermine the maintainability,
   communicability and replicability of the process. To ameliorate this
   problem we propose the Leaf system, the aim of which is to seamlessly
   introduce the pipeline formality on top of a dynamical development
   process with minimum overhead for the programmer, thus providing a
   simple layer of software structuring.
   Results: Leaf includes a formal language for the definition of pipelines
   with code that can be transparently inserted into the user's Python
   code. Its syntax is designed to visually highlight dependencies in the
   pipeline structure it defines. While encouraging the developer to think
   in terms of bioinformatic pipelines, Leaf supports a number of automated
   features including data and session persistence, consistency checks
   between steps of the analysis, processing optimization and publication
   of the analytic protocol in the form of a hypertext.
   Conclusions: Leaf offers a powerful balance between plan-driven and
   change-driven development environments in the design, management and
   communication of bioinformatic pipelines. Its unique features make it a
   valuable alternative to other related tools.

AB Concerns exist within the medical and psychological sciences that many
   published research findings are not replicable. Guidelines accordingly
   recommend that the file drawer effect should be eliminated and that
   statistical significance should not be a criterion in the decision to
   submit and publish scientific results. By means of a simulation study,
   we show that selectively publishing effects that differ significantly
   from the cumulative meta-analytic effect evokes the Proteus phenomenon
   of poorly replicable and alternating findings. However, the simulation
   also shows that the selective publication approach yields a scientific
   record that is content rich as compared to publishing everything, in the
   sense that fewer publications are needed for obtaining an accurate
   meta-analytic estimation of the true effect. We conclude that, under the
   assumption of self-correcting science, the file drawer effect can be
   beneficial for the scientific collective.

AB Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have detected many disease
   associations. However, the reported variants tend to explain small
   fractions of risk, and there are doubts about issues such as the
   portability of findings over different ethnic groups or the relative
   roles of rare versus common variants in the genetic architecture of
   complex disease. Studying the degree of sharing of disease-associated
   variants across populations can help in solving these issues. We present
   a comprehensive survey of GWAS replicability across 28 diseases. Most
   loci and SNPs discovered in Europeans for these conditions have been
   extensively replicated using peoples of European and East Asian
   ancestry, while the replication with individuals of African ancestry is
   much less common. We found a strong and significant correlation of Odds
   Ratios across Europeans and East Asians, indicating that underlying
   causal variants are common and shared between the two ancestries.
   Moreover, SNPs that failed to replicate in East Asians map into genomic
   regions where Linkage Disequilibrium patterns differ significantly
   between populations. Finally, we observed that GWAS with larger sample
   sizes have detected variants with weaker effects rather than with lower
   frequencies. Our results indicate that most GWAS results are due to
   common variants. In addition, the sharing of disease alleles and the
   high correlation in their effect sizes suggest that most of the
   underlying causal variants are shared between Europeans and East Asians
   and that they tend to map close to the associated marker SNPs.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship
   between typically measured prenatal screening biomarkers and
   early-preterm birth in euploid pregnancies.
   STUDY DESIGN: The study included 345 early-preterm cases (<30 weeks of
   gestation) and 1725 control subjects who were drawn from a
   population-based sample of California pregnancies who had both first-
   and second-trimester screening results. Logistic regression analyses
   were used to compare patterns of biomarkers in cases and control
   subjects and to develop predictive models. Replicability of the
   biomarker early-preterm relationships that was revealed by the models
   was evaluated by examination of the frequency and associated adjusted
   relative risks (RRs) for early-preterm birth and for preterm birth in
   general (<37 weeks of gestation) in pregnancies with identified abnormal
   markers compared with pregnancies without these markers in a subsequent
   independent California cohort of screened pregnancies (n = 76,588).
   RESULTS: The final model for early-preterm birth included
   first-trimester pregnancy-associated plasma protein A in the <= 5th
   percentile, second-trimester alpha-fetoprotein in the >= 95th
   percentile, and second-trimester inhibin in the >= 95th percentile (odds
   ratios, 2.3-3.6). In general, pregnancies in the subsequent cohort with
   a biomarker pattern that were found to be associated with early-preterm
   delivery in the first sample were at an increased risk for early-preterm
   birth and preterm birth in general (<37 weeks of gestation; adjusted RR,
   1.6-27.4). Pregnancies with >= 2 biomarker abnormalities were at
   particularly increased risk (adjusted RR, 3.6-27.4).
   CONCLUSION: When considered across cohorts and in combination,
   abnormalities in routinely collected biomarkers reveal predictable risks
   for early-preterm birth.

AB We report on the development of a life sciences curriculum, targeted to
   undergraduate students, which was modeled after a commercially available
   physics curriculum and based on aspects of how people learn. Our paper
   describes the collaborative development process and necessary
   modifications required to apply a physics pedagogical model in a life
   sciences context. While some approaches were easily adapted, others
   provided significant challenges. Among these challenges were:
   representations of energy, introducing definitions, the placement of
   Scientists' Ideas, and the replicability of data. In modifying the
   curriculum to address these challenges, we have come to see them as
   speaking to deeper differences between the disciplines, namely that
   introductory physics-for example, Newton's laws, magnetism, light-is a
   science of pairwise interaction, while introductory biology-for example,
   photosynthesis, evolution, cycling of matter in ecosystems-is a science
   of linked processes, and we suggest that this is how the two disciplines
   are presented in introductory classes. We illustrate this tension
   through an analysis of our adaptations of the physics curriculum for
   instruction on the cycling of matter and energy; we show that
   modifications of the physics curriculum to address the biological
   framework promotes strong gains in student understanding of these
   topics, as evidenced by analysis of student work.

   The paper reviews MARS, describes "best" meta-analytic practices across
   two schools of meta-analysis, and shows how implementing such practices
   helps achieve the aims set forth in MARS. Examples of best practices are
   provided to aid readers in finding models for their own research.
   Meta-analytic reviews are a primary avenue for the accumulation of
   knowledge in the organizational sciences as well as many other areas of
   science. Unfortunately, many meta-analytic reviews in the organizational
   sciences do not fully follow professional guidelines and standards as
   closely as they should. Such deviations from best practice undermine the
   transparency and replicability of the reviews and thus their usefulness
   for the generation of cumulative knowledge and evidence-based practice.
   This study shows how implementing "best" meta-analytic practices helps
   to achieve the aims set forth in MARS. Although the paper is written
   primarily for organizational scientists, the paper's recommendations are
   not limited to any particular scientific domain.

AB A growing number of structural neuroimaging studies have reported
   significant changes in gray matter density or volume and white matter
   microstructure in the adult human brain following training. Such reports
   appear consistent with animal studies of training-dependent structural
   plasticity showing changes in, for example, dendritic spines. However,
   given the microscopic nature of these changes in animals and the
   relatively low spatial resolution of MRI, it is unclear that such
   changes can be reliably detected in humans. Here, we critically evaluate
   the robustness of the current evidence in humans, focusing on the
   specificity, replicability, and the relationship of the reported changes
   with behavior. We find that limitations of experimental design,
   statistical methods, and methodological artifacts may underlie many of
   the reported effects, seriously undermining the evidence for
   training-dependent structural changes in adult humans. The most robust
   evidence, showing specificity of structural changes to training, task
   and brain region, shows changes in anterior hippocampal volume with
   exercise in elderly participants. We conclude that more compelling
   evidence and converging data from animal studies is required to
   substantiate structural changes in the adult human brain with training,
   especially in the neocortex. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The development of successful treatments for humans after traumatic
   brain or spinal cord injuries (TBI and SCI, respectively) requires
   animal research. This effort can be hampered when promising experimental
   results cannot be replicated because of incorrect data analysis
   procedures. To identify and hopefully avoid these errors in future
   studies, the articles in seven journals with the highest number of basic
   science central nervous system TBI and SCI animal research studies
   published in 2010 (N = 125 articles) were reviewed for their data
   analysis procedures. After identifying the most common statistical
   errors, the implications of those findings were demonstrated by
   reanalyzing previously published data from our laboratories using the
   identified inappropriate statistical procedures, then comparing the two
   sets of results. Overall, 70% of the articles contained at least one
   type of inappropriate statistical procedure. The highest percentage
   involved incorrect post hoc t-tests (56.4%), followed by inappropriate
   parametric statistics (analysis of variance and t-test; 37.6%). Repeated
   Measures analysis was inappropriately missing in 52.0% of all articles
   and, among those with behavioral assessments, 58% were analyzed
   incorrectly. Reanalysis of our published data using the most common
   inappropriate statistical procedures resulted in a 14.1% average
   increase in significant effects compared to the original results.
   Specifically, an increase of 15.5% occurred with Independent t-tests and
   11.1% after incorrect post hoc t-tests. Utilizing proper statistical
   procedures can allow more-definitive conclusions, facilitate
   replicability of research results, and enable more accurate translation
   of those results to the clinic.

AB NOTCH1 has been found recurrently mutated in a subset of patients with
   chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). To analyze biological features and
   clinical impact of NOTCH1 mutations in CLL, we sequenced this gene in
   565 patients. NOTCH1 mutations, found in 63 patients (11%), were
   associated with unmutated IGHV, high expression of CD38 and ZAP-70,
   trisomy 12, advanced stage and elevated lactate dehydrogenase.
   Sequential analysis in 200 patients demonstrated acquisition of mutation
   in one case (0.5%) and disappearance after treatment in two. Binet A and
   B patients with NOTCH1-mutated had a shorter time to treatment.
   NOTCH1-mutated patients were more frequently refractory to therapy and
   showed shorter progression-free and overall survival after complete
   remission. Overall survival was shorter in NOTCH1-mutated patients,
   although not independently from IGHV. NOTCH1 mutation increased the risk
   of transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma independently from
   IGHV, with this being validated in resampling tests of replicability. In
   summary, NOTCH1 mutational status, that was rarely acquired during the
   course of the disease, identify a genetic subgroup with high risk of
   transformation and poor outcome. This recently identified genetic
   subgroup of CLL patients deserves prospective studies to define their
   best management.

AB Entheseal changes (ECs) have been widely recorded using visual methods,
   but size and shape affect stress distribution which cannot be quantified
   visually. The aim of this paper is to present a simple method for
   quantifying size and shape by applying parameters to quantify shape and
   to highlight preliminary results indicating that this method provides
   useful data. Hypotheses tested were: common extensor origin size
   correlates with humerus size; ECs change the size and shape of entheses;
   surface area is increased in those entheses with bony proliferation. The
   common extensor origins of 43 male skeletons from medieval York were
   recorded. The entheses were recorded visually for any deviation from a
   smooth surface. The chord was measured using sliding calipers and the
   shape of the entheses recorded using a profile gauge and quantified
   using parameters (e.g. the standard deviation of the surface from a mean
   line) which assess the relationship of the surface to a flat surface. To
   test replicability, disarticulated humeri were also recorded
   (inter-observer error n = 9; intra-observer error n = 20) using the same
   methodology. Replicability for size and shape was good for
   intra-observer error but weaker for inter-observer error. There is
   variability in enthesis size and distal humeral condyle size; normal
   entheses are smaller than those with EC while their surface shape
   differs and is affected by the type of EC (proliferative or
   destructive); surface area in those entheses with proliferative ECs is
   increased. The use of these parameters for quantifying enthesis size and
   shape provides insights into enthesis variability which cannot be tested
   using visual methods alone. These parameters can be recorded using this
   two-dimensional method or can be measured on data collected with a laser
   scanner. Future research will test the relationship between surface
   size/shape and the effects of biological sex, age and occupation.

   monitoring of dam deformations, due to its speed in obtaining thousands

AB DSM-IV-TR defines four subtypes of bipolar disorder (BP): bipolar I,
   bipolar II, cyclothymic disorder and bipolar not otherwise specified
   (NOS). However, cyclothymic disorder in children is rarely researched,
   or often subsumed in an "NOS" category. The present study tests the
   replicability of findings from an earlier study, and expands on the
   criterion validity of cyclothymic disorder in youth. Using the Robins
   and Guze (1970) framework we examined the validity of cyclothymic
   disorder as a subtype of BP. Using a youth (ages 5-17) outpatient
   clinical sample (N = 894), participants with cyclothymic disorder (n =
   53) were compared to participants with other BP spectrum disorders (n =
   399) and to participants with non-bipolar disorders (n = 442). Analyses
   tested differences in youth with cyclothymic disorder and bipolar
   disorder not otherwise specified who do, and those who do not, have a
   parent with BP. Compared to youth with non-bipolar disorders, youth with
   cyclothymic disorder had higher irritability (p < 0.001), more
   comorbidity (p < 0.001), greater sleep disturbance (p < 0.005), and were
   more likely to have a family history of BP (p < 0.001). Cyclothymic
   disorder was associated with a younger age of onset compared to
   depression (p < 0.001) and bipolar II (p = 0.05). Parental BP status was
   not significantly associated with any variables. Results support that
   cyclothymic disorder belongs on the bipolar spectrum. Epidemiological
   studies indicate that cyclothymic disorder is not uncommon and involves
   significant impairment. Failing to differentiate between cyclothymic
   disorder and bipolar NOS limits our knowledge about a significant
   proportion of cases of bipolarity.

   changing the behaviour of authors, editors, reviewers, and promotion
   committees seem useful, in isolation, some are simply rallying cries to
   'be good'. Other suggestions might attack the replicability problem but
   would create serious side effects in both the publication process and
   the academic endeavour. Moreover, we should be concerned primarily for
   replication of key, highly cited results, not for replication of the

AB Diatoms respond rapidly to eutrophication and diatom-based models for
   inferring total phosphorus (TP) have found wide application in
   palaeolimnology, especially in tracking trajectories of past and recent
   nutrient enrichment and in establishing pre-disturbance targets for
   restoration. Using new analysis of existing training sets and
   sediment-cores we examine the statistical and ecological constraints of
   diatom-inferred TP (DI-TP) models. Although the models show an
   apparently strong relationship between measured and inferred TP in the
   training sets, even under cross-validation, the models display three
   fundamental weaknesses, namely (1) the relationship between TP and
   diatom relative abundance is heavily confounded with secondary variables
   such as alkalinity and lake depth, (2) the models contain many taxa that
   are not significantly related to TP, and (3) comparison between
   different models shows poor or no spatial replicability. At some sites
   the sediment-core diatom assemblage change tracks the TP gradient in the
   training sets and DI-TP reconstructions are consistent with monitored TP
   data and known catchment histories for the recent past. At others diatom
   species turnover is apparently related to variables other than TP, and
   DI-TP fails to even reproduce plausible trends. Pre-disturbance DI-TP
   values are also questionable atmost sites. We argue that these problems
   pervade many DI-TP models, particularly those where violations of the
   basic assumptions of the transfer function approach are ignored.

   with measures of obsessive-compulsive symptomatology, compulsive
   shopping, depression, and anxiety In Study 2, temporal stability of the
   SI-R was investigated by administering the scale to 75 participants
   twice with a 4-week interval in between. In Study 3, 452 participants
   completed the SI-R through the internet. Evidence of internal
   consistency, test-retest reliability, construct validity and
   replicability of the original three-correlated-factor structure was
   obtained. After ruling out the bias due to nonrandomized assignment to
   administration methods through propensity matching, multiple-group
   confirmatory factor analyses provided evidence of measurement invariance
   among the administration formats. However, higher latent and manifest
   mean scores were observed in online participants, consistent with the
   "online disinhibition effect." These results suggest that the Italian
   version of the SI-R retains the psychometric properties of the original
   in both the paper-and-pencil and online versions, though different norms
   may be needed.

AB BACKGROUND: Self-management is proposed as the standard of care in
   chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but details of the process
   and training required to deliver effective self-management are not
   widely available. In addition, recent data suggest that patient
   engagement and motivation are critical ingredients for effective
   self-management. This article carefully describes a self-management
   intervention using motivational interviewing skills, aimed to increase
   engagement and commitment in severe COPD patients.
   METHODS: The intervention was developed and pilot tested for fidelity to
   protocol, for patient and interventionist feedback (qualitative) and
   effect on quality of life. Engagement between patient and
   interventionists was measured by the Working Alliance Inventory. The
   intervention was refined on the basis of the results of the pilot study
   and delivered in the active arm of a prospective randomized study.
   RESULTS: The pilot study suggested improvements in quality of life,
   fidelity to theory, and patient acceptability. The refined
   self-management intervention was delivered 540 times in the active arm
   of a randomized study. We observed a retention rate of 86% (patients
   missing or not available for only 14% the scheduled encounters).
   CONCLUSIONS: A self-management intervention that includes motivational
   interviewing as the way if guiding patients into behavior change is
   feasible in severe COPD and may increase patient engagement and
   commitment to self-management. This provides a very detailed description
   of the process for the specifics of training and delivering the
   intervention, which facilitates replicability in other settings and
   could be translated to cardiac rehabilitation.

AB Many previous works suggested that visual indicators could be used to
   predict landscape preferences. Most works, however, judged the visual
   indicators by a subjective method, which was criticized for lack of
   standardization in methodology, nontransparent application of values,
   and lack of replicability. This paper studied the relationships between
   landscape preferences and 10 visual indicators, among which seven
   indicators were evaluated by an objective measurement. Another three
   indicators (years of history heritages, number of landscape elements,
   and impression) were evaluated by a subjective method because they
   depend on a human's perception. The landscape preferences were judged by
   undergraduate students based on the stimuli of 30 photographs taken in
   the two cities of Hangzhou and Suzhou in the east of China. The results
   show that students prefer landscape with historical heritage of 200-600
   years, moderate impression, approximately 60% of open land cover and 45%
   of water body cover, lower plant cover, more heterogeneities, and higher
   naturalness; no significantly statistical relationships exist between
   students' preference scores and the ratio of disturbed area, building
   cover, or topographic variation cover. These results were confirmed by
   another six photographs; and last, some suggestions for landscape design
   were given. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)UP.1943-5444.0000137. (C) 2013 American

AB The Vehicle in the Loop (VIL) is a simulator, which combines real
   driving experience with the replicability and safety of simulators. In
   the VIL test setup a real test vehicle is combined with a virtual
   testing environment which is displayed to the user via a head-mounted
   display (HMD). In theory, this simulation concept renders the VIL
   uniquely suited to the development and evaluation of numerous automotive
   applications, including driver assistance systems. Aiming to assess the
   extent to which the VIL elicits realistic driving responses, a
   validation study was performed. In this first validation study the focus
   was on longitudinal driving behavior. 44 participants performed five
   common traffic maneuvers in reality and the VIL setup. Simulator
   sickness was assessed with the simulator sickness questionnaire (SSQ).
   Descriptive and inferential analyses of the data showed that the VIL
   achieves relative validity concerning brake pressure and reaction times
   and absolute validity concerning the steering angle. However, subjects
   showed longer reaction times and accelerated more smoothly while driving
   the VIL. One possible explanation for these results could be the
   presence of simulator sickness. Overall, the study indicates that the
   VIL represents a suitable testing method for the evaluation and
   development of driver assistance systems. The study also provided clear
   indications for the future development of the VIL.

AB BACKGROUND: Future physicians may not be prepared for the challenges of
   caring for the growing population of poor patients in this country.
   Given the potential for a socioeconomic "gulf" between physicians and
   patients and the lack of curricula that address the specific needs of
   poor patients, resident knowledge about caring for this underserved
   population is low.
   INTERVENTION: We created a 2-day Resident Academy orientation, before
   the start of residency training, to improve community knowledge and
   address resident attitudes toward poor patients through team-based
   experiential activities. We collected demographic and satisfaction data
   through anonymous presurvey and postsurvey t tests, and descriptive
   analysis of the quantitative data were conducted. Qualitative comments
   from open-ended questions were reviewed, coded, and divided into themes.
   We also offer information on the cost and replicability of the Academy.
   RESULTS: Residents rated most components of the Academy as "very good"
   or "excellent." Satisfaction scores were higher among residents in
   primary care training programs than among residents in nonprimary care
   programs for most Academy elements. Qualitative data demonstrated an
   overall positive effect on resident knowledge and attitudes about
   community resource availability for underserved patients, and the
   challenges of poor patients to access high-quality health care.
   CONCLUSIONS: The Resident Academy orientation improved knowledge and
   attitudes of new residents before the start of residency, and residents
   were satisfied with the experience. The commitment of institutional
   leaders is essential for success.

AB The paper reports on a prototype urban metabolism approach to model
   carbon cycling through an urban neighborhood. The approach uses
   bottom-up modeling of urban form components (buildings, vehicles,
   people, plants) to assess the neighborhood-wide storage, intake and
   export (including atmospheric emissions) of carbon. Model inputs (land
   cover, population, building types, vegetation structure) were derived
   through integration of spatial and non-spatial data from remote sensing,
   statistical and cadastral sources. Results are quantified and
   illustrated as whole system and component carbon flows attributable to
   (i) buildings, (ii) transportation, (iii) humans (including food and
   waste), and (iv) vegetation and soils sectors. Three emissions reduction
   scenarios use these results as a baseline against which to illustrate
   the potential of familiar climate change planning strategies. These
   scenarios achieve per capita emission reductions targets of
   approximately 37%, 52% and 69% from that baseline. Concluding discussion
   considers the limits, replicability and potential of the approach for
   linking climate change to local planning. Crown Copyright (C) 2012

AB Mechanisms of visual perception should be robustly fast and provide
   veridical information about environmental objects in order to facilitate
   survival and successful coping. Because species-specific brain
   mechanisms for fast vision must have evolved under heavy pressure for
   efficiency, it has been held that different human individuals see the
   physical world in the same way and produce psychophysical functions of
   visual discrimination that are qualitatively the same. For many years,
   this assumption has been implicitly accepted in vision research studying
   extremely fast, basic visual processes, including studies of visual
   masking. However, in recent studies of metacontrast masking surprisingly
   robust individual differences in the qualitative aspects of subjects'
   performance have been found. As the basic species-specific visual
   functions very likely are based on universal brain mechanisms of vision,
   these differences probably are the outcome of variability in ontogenetic
   development (i.e., formation of idiosyncrasic skills of perception).
   Such developmental differences can be brought about by variants of genes
   that are differentially expressed in the course of CNS development. The
   objective of this study was to assess whether visual discrimination in
   metacontrast masking is related to three widely studied genetic
   polymorphisms implicated in brain function and used here as independent
   variables. The findings suggest no main effects of BDNF Val66Met,
   NRG1/rs6994992, or 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms on metacontrast performance,
   but several notable interactions of genetic variables with gender, stage
   of the sequence of experimental trials, perceptual strategies, and
   target/mask shape congruence were found. Thus, basic behavioral
   functions of fast vision may be influenced by common genetic
   variability. Also, when left uncontrolled, genetic factors may seriously
   confound variables in vision research using masking, obscure clear
   theoretical interpretation, lead to unexplicable inter-regional
   differences and create problems of replicability of formerly successful
   experiments.

AB Increasingly micro technology becomes more Important in order to develop
   new products with high added value. These new technologies known as
   micro allow us manufacturing precision components; these new micro
   components should work and take carrying out the functions previously
   performed by larger parts. Microinjection is one of these new
   technologies. This has the capacity to produce parts, for different
   materials both plastic and metal and for some industries and
   applications. The main objective in this paper is to determine the
   replicate microtextures capability for plastic injection molds. For our
   samples. ABS plastic is injected into four aluminum cavities with
   different laser textures performed in, using different technologies to
   get them. In order to analyze how mold texture affects parts, optical
   interferometry technique was selected to measure it. The superficial
   topography obtained was processed using MountainsMapTm software, in
   order to get the replicability of injected parts. It has also been used
   an electron microscopy (SEM) to evaluate the mold textures and injected
   parts in a photographically way. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by

   of the economic and cultural form of sports tourism and festivals
   clusters into the synergy and rapid development of the Shandong
   Peninsula Blue Economy Zone of the same horizon; explores the
   possibility, significance and the solution of the coupling. Our study
   shows that the regional festivals clusters have a certain scale, with an
   clear economic and social effects; regional sports tourism is developing
   separately, with a broad prospect, but the development is slow or
   stagnant; the basis of the coupling consist of the homology of the
   cultural form, the identity of the region, the consistency of the target
   and the replicability of the experiences. With the aid of the brand
   effects of the festivals clusters, regional sports tourism will get a
   wide range of social awareness in a short time, in turn, the festivals
   clusters will get some new development power. At present, we should
   strengthen the linkage of the festivals clusters, absorb the sports
   tourism elements for the contents and forms of the festivals clusters,
   and widen the marine development direction for the festivals clusters;
   develop the sports tourism products suitable for the festivals clusters,
   promote the integrated development of culture, sports and tourism,
   ensuring the smooth realization of the regional development goal.

AB India's wildlife conservation strategy relies on creating 'inviolate'
   protected areas (PAs) free from human disturbance, using policing of PAs
   and physical displacement of human populations as the preferred tools to
   do so. Conservation-induced displacement causes not just loss of
   livelihood and dwellings but also increases vulnerability and
   impoverishment risks of displaced people. By and large, the state's
   record of rehabilitating people displaced from PAs has been quite dismal
   in India. This article examines a rare case of conservation-induced
   displacement and resettlement where the livelihood outcomes for the
   displaced people are said to be positive. The relocation of over 400
   households from the Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary in Karnataka in the late
   1990s has been held up as a case where both conservation goals and local
   people's livelihoods gained from displacement. The success of Bhadra has
   inspired a spate of calls by conservationists in India to use village
   relocation as a 'win-win' opportunity to attain simultaneously the goals
   of wildlife conservation and poverty alleviation for forest-dwelling
   communities. This article delves into the process and politics of
   displacement, resettlement and rehabilitation in Bhadra from the point
   of view of examining this claim and assessing its replicability
   elsewhere.

AB BACKGROUND: Honey is a viscous, supersaturated sugar solution derived
   from nectar gathered and modified by the honeybee, Apis mellifera. Honey
   has been used since ancient times as a remedy in wound care. Evidence
   from animal studies and some trials has suggested that honey may
   accelerate wound healing.
   OBJECTIVES: The objective was to determine whether honey increases the
   rate of healing in acute wounds (e.g. burns, lacerations) and chronic
   wounds (e.g. skin ulcers, infected surgical wounds).
   SEARCH METHODS: For this first update of the review we searched the
   Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 13 June 2012); The
   Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane
   Library 2012, Issue 5); Ovid MEDLINE (2008 to May Week 5 2012); Ovid
   MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations 12 June 2012); Ovid
   EMBASE (2008 to 2012 Week 23); and EBSCO CINAHL (2008 to 8 June 2012).
   SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised trials that
   evaluated honey as a treatment for any sort of acute or chronic wound
   were sought. There was no restriction in terms of source, date of
   publication or language. Wound healing was the primary endpoint.
   DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data from eligible trials were extracted
   and summarised by one review author, using a data extraction sheet, and
   independently verified by a second review author.
   MAIN RESULTS: We identified 25 trials (with a total of 2987
   participants) that met the inclusion criteria, including six new trials
   that were added to this update. In acute wounds, three trials evaluated
   the effect of honey in acute lacerations, abrasions or minor surgical
   wounds and 12 trials evaluated the effect of honey in burns. In chronic
   wounds, two trials evaluated the effect of honey in venous leg ulcers,
   and single trials investigated its effect in infected post-operative
   wounds, pressure injuries, cutaneous Lieshmaniasis, diabetic foot ulcers
   and Fournier's gangrene. Three trials recruited people into mixed groups
   of chronic or acute wounds. Most trials were at high or unclear risk of
   bias. In acute wounds, specifically partial-thickness burns, honey might
   reduce time to healing compared with some conventional dressings (WMD
   -4.68 days, 95%CI -4.28 to -5.09 days), but, when compared with early
   excision and grafting, honey delays healing in partial- and
   full-thickness burns (WMD 13.6 days, 95% CI 10.02 to 17.18 days). In
   chronic wounds, honey does not significantly increase healing in venous
   leg ulcers when used as an adjuvant to compression (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.96
   to 1.38), and may delay healing in cutaneous Leishmaniasis when used as
   an adjuvant to meglumine antimoniate compared to meglumine antimoniate
   alone (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.01).
   AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Honey dressings do not increase rates of healing
   significantly in venous leg ulcers when used as an adjuvant to
   compression. Honey may delay healing in partial- and full-thickness
   burns in comparison to early excision and grafting, and in cutaneous
   Leishmaniasis when used as an adjuvant with meglumine antimoniate. Honey
   might be superior to some conventional dressing materials, but there is
   considerable uncertainty about the replicability and applicability of
   this evidence. There is insufficient evidence to guide clinical practice
   in other types of wounds, and purchasers should refrain from providing
   honey dressings for routine use until sufficient evidence of effect is
   available.

   addition, weight calculation is unified by algorithm of vector
   decomposition dimension and quasi orthogonal weight, calculated through
   corresponding to the objective value. That overcomes subjective and
   difficult degeneration in constructing pairwise comparison matrix in
   analytic hierarchy process. By computer simulation, the result obtained,
   using algorithm of vector decomposition dimension and quasi orthogonal
   weigh are better than that from the analytic hierarchy process, by 2% in
   terms of accuracy. Therefore, the algorithm has application and

   Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire (ZKPQ) at the factor-level.
   The ZKPQ assesses the five basic factors of Zuckerman's alternative
   five-factor model (AFFM). Study 1 (n = 449) assessed the psychometric
   properties of the Romanian version of the ZKPQ and verified its
   factorial structure. The factors reliability ranged from .69 to .88, and
   gender differences were similar to those found in the Spanish, French,
   and Chinese samples. Exploratory factor analysis supported the
   replicability of the original five-factor structure, and correlations
   between the scales showed that the five basic factors of the AFFM are
   relatively independent. Study 2 (n = 238) verified the convergent and
   divergent validity of the Romanian version of the ZKPQ, by testing its
   links with DECAS, a personality inventory based on the five-factor
   model, developed and well-validated on the Romanian population. The
   results showed good convergent and divergent validity, with all
   identified correlations supporting the correspondence between the two
   personality models. Overall, the present findings showed that the
   Romanian version of the ZKPQ is a valid tool for assessing personality
   traits according to the AFFM.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a method for
   ultrasonically molding polymer powder in a micro plastic part mold. In
   the method, a printed circuit board (PCB) in which micro-hole arrays are
   drilled is used as a micro cavity insert. With the utilization of
   ultrasonic vibration, the polymer powder, which is prefilled and
   compacted in a micro cavity, mutually generates great sliding friction
   heat so as to be rapidly plasticized and molded.
   Design/methodology/approach - Micro carbide drill bits of which the
   diameters are 100.0 mu m, 150.0 mu m and 200.0 mu m, respectively, are
   used for drilling the PCB to form a micro-hole array insert. Next, two
   kinds of various ultra-high molecule weight polyethylene (UHMW-PE)
   powder with various grain diameters are directly filled into a charging
   barrel and a mold cavity with the micro-hole array insert. Proper
   process parameters are set on ultrasonic plasticizing and molding
   equipment so that a molding test can be performed. The melt of UHMW-PE
   can be rapidly filled into the cavity. Finally, micro-column array
   plastic parts are successfully prepared.
   Findings - The micro-hole array PCB is a mold insert which is quite
   applicable for the ultrasonic molding of the powder in the mold. When a
   molding material is the coarse UHMW-PE powder with the grain diameter of
   about 350 mu m, the diameter replication rates of the micro-column array
   plastic parts become good in order with the increased micro-hole
   diameter of the PCB. When the fine UHMW-PE powder with the grain
   diameter of about 80 tan is adopted, the diameter replication rates of
   the micro-column array plastic parts become good in order with the
   decreased micro-hole diameter of the PCB.
   Originality/value - In this paper, the micro-column array plastic parts
   with good replicability are successfully prepared by a technique for
   ultrasonically plasticizing and molding in the cavity. The technique can
   be applied to the fields of medical treatment communication, optics,
   chemistry and so on, such as biological micro needle arrays, micro
   biological chips, optical memories, and micro chemical reaction chips.

DI 10.1002/14651858.CD005083.pub3

PY 2013
AB Background
   Honey is a viscous, supersaturated sugar solution derived from nectar
   gathered and modified by the honeybee, Apis mellifera. Honey has been
   used since ancient times as a remedy in wound care. Evidence from animal
   studies and some trials has suggested that honey may accelerate wound
   healing.
   Objectives
   The objective was to determine whether honey increases the rate of
   healing in acute wounds (e. g. burns, lacerations) and chronic wounds
   (e. g. skin ulcers, infected surgical wounds).
   Search methods
   For this first update of the review we searched the Cochrane Wounds
   Group Specialised Register (searched 13 June 2012); The Cochrane Central
   Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012,
   Issue 5); Ovid MEDLINE (2008 to May Week 5 2012); Ovid MEDLINE
   (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations 12 June 2012); Ovid EMBASE
   (2008 to 2012 Week 23); and EBSCO CINAHL (2008 to 8 June 2012).
   Selection criteria
   Randomised and quasi-randomised trials that evaluated honey as a
   treatment for any sort of acute or chronic wound were sought. There was
   no restriction in terms of source, date of publication or language.
   Wound healing was the primary endpoint.
   Data collection and analysis
   Data from eligible trials were extracted and summarised by one review
   author, using a data extraction sheet, and independently verified by a
   second review author.
   Main results
   We identified 25 trials (with a total of 2987 participants) that met the
   inclusion criteria, including six new trials that were added to this
   update. In acute wounds, three trials evaluated the effect of honey in
   acute lacerations, abrasions or minor surgical wounds and 12 trials
   evaluated the effect of honey in burns. In chronic wounds, two trials
   evaluated the effect of honey in venous leg ulcers, and single trials
   investigated its effect in infected post-operative wounds, pressure
   injuries, cutaneous Lieshmaniasis, diabetic foot ulcers and Fournier's
   gangrene. Three trials recruited people into mixed groups of chronic or
   acute wounds. Most trials were at high or unclear risk of bias.
   In acute wounds, specifically partial-thickness burns, honey might
   reduce time to healing compared with some conventional dressings (WMD
   -4.68 days, 95% CI -4.28 to -5.09 days), but, when compared with early
   excision and grafting, honey delays healing in partial- and
   full-thickness burns (WMD 13.6 days, 95% CI 10.02 to 17.18 days). In
   chronic wounds, honey does not significantly increase healing in venous
   leg ulcers when used as an adjuvant to compression (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.96
   to 1.38), and may delay healing in cutaneous Leishmaniasis when used as
   an adjuvant to meglumine antimoniate compared to meglumine antimoniate
   alone (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.01).
   Authors' conclusions
   Honey dressings do not increase rates of healing significantly in venous
   leg ulcers when used as an adjuvant to compression. Honey may delay
   healing in partial-and full-thickness burns in comparison to early
   excision and grafting, and in cutaneous Leishmaniasis when used as an
   adjuvant with meglumine antimoniate. Honey might be superior to some
   conventional dressing materials, but there is considerable uncertainty
   about the replicability and applicability of this evidence. There is
   insufficient evidence to guide clinical practice in other types of

   a special focus on the patients' individual core conflictual
   relationship themes, their universality, as well as interventions
   promoting group processes and therapeutic factors of group therapy. We
   introduce the new concept and report results of a pilot case study (N =
   8). Analyses revealed a pre-post-treatment effect size of g = 0.64 (95%
   CI [0.29; 1.00]) on the primary outcome measure, the Liebowitz Social
   Anxiety Scale (LSAS). Furthermore we obtained positive evidence with
   regard to acceptance, safety and feasibility of the psychodynamic group
   therapy concept for social phobia. Subsequent proof-of-concept studies
   are required to foster treatment development and to proof the

AB This study analyses the fundamental components shaping the violence
   legitimation discourse of ETA (Euskadi Ta Askasuna). With this aim, a
   category system has been built, which organizes the psychosocial
   processes identified in previous studies related to violence
   legitimation. Based on the proposed category system, a content analysis
   was conducted on 21 statements of ETA, released between 1998 and 2011.
   An intra-observer and inter-observer reliability analysis reveals high
   level stability and replicability of the categorization. The results
   show, firstly, that outgroup components have a predominant presence over
   ingroup components. Secondly, in the components hierarchy, we observe
   that elements referring to identity come in first place, followed in
   similar frequencies by those related to violence representation and the
   definition of the situation.

   in a real driving environment and in the VIL simulation. Steering
   behavior was found to be less intense in the virtual driving
   environment. It was, however, affected equally in both driving
   environments by driver-independent steering wheel torque, demonstrating
   relative validity of the VIL setup with regard to steering responses in
   challenging situations.

AB Psychology has been historically plagued by the under-reporting of both
   replications and null findings. The avoidance of these core ingredients
   of scientific practice means that the psychology literature is
   unquestionably distorted. The bias in psychology is pervasive and
   systemic, afflicting researchers, reviewers, editors and journals, all
   of whom are wed to pursuing the novel and the curious at the expense of
   the reliable. Psychology therefore operates in a manner that is askew of
   other sciences, with the links between replicability and believability
   seemingly much weaker. Additional problems follow from the distorted way
   that psychology currently operates - including spinning findings,
   publication bias, and sadly, outright fraud. Such problems represent a
   serious challenge for psychologists to get their house-in-order - and
   one step is to make sure that replications and null findings find a home
   in psychology rather than remain our dirty little secrets that further
   eat away at the credibility of our science.

AB Background: Widespread changes in the health care landscape require a
   paradigm shift from an educational model where quality improvement (QI)
   expertise is centralized to a model where foundational and functional QI
   knowledge is widespread through all levels of a health care
   organization. Methods: To support a new educational structure
   prioritizing QI education as a stand-alone priority, a 6-month
   educational course was introduced for operational leaders (requiring
   completion of a real-life improvement project) and a second,
   introductory QI education set of 5 stand-alone classes was introduced
   for managers and frontline staff; the latter is provided at centralized
   sites, on-site, and via webinars. Additional QI courses have been
   introduced for board members. Results: Sixty operational leaders
   attended the first 2 offerings of the 6-month course and completed 50
   associated QI projects, as of July 2012; nearly 1500 participants have
   attended the "Just-in-Time" classes, representing 13 University of
   Pittsburgh Medical Center hospitals and affiliated facilities.
   Eighty-three percent of recent participants rated the 6-month course a 4
   or 5 in terms of efficacy. Two-thirds of participants from both 6-month
   series reported that they continued to work on their project once the
   class was over. Discussion: The number of course attendees and their
   feedback regarding efficacy of this educational approach, as well as the
   volume of associated completed projects, indicate success in providing
   greater numbers of staff at all levels of the organization with QI
   education and tools. This educational format shows promise for further
   refinement and replicability.

AB The use of manual-based interventions tends to improve client outcomes
   and promote replicability. With an increasingly strong link between
   funding and the use of empirically supported prevention and intervention
   programs, manual development and adaptation have become research
   priorities. As a result, researchers and scholars have generated
   guidelines for developing manuals from scratch, but there are no extant
   guidelines for adapting empirically supported, manualized prevention and
   intervention programs for use with new populations. Thus, this article
   proposes step-by-step guidelines for the manual adaptation process. It
   also describes two adaptations of an extensively researched anger
   management intervention to exemplify how an empirically supported
   program was systematically and efficiently adapted to achieve similar
   outcomes with vastly different populations in unique settings.

AB The micro-molding of thermoplastic polymer is a popular fabrication
   method for micro/nano devices because several thousand parts can be
   produced after a mold insert has been made. Most micro-molding
   techniques such as hot embossing or injection molding use thermal energy
   to plasticize the thermoplastic polymer, and require an additional
   cooling stage. Recently ultrasonic vibration energy has been used to
   soften a local region of thermoplastic polymer by inducing frictional
   heat between an ultrasonic tool horn and the polymer material. The
   present study aims to develop an ultrasonic patterning process in which
   the micro-patterns engraved on the tool horn are replicated onto the
   surface of a polymer film. For this purpose, the design of a tool horn
   for the ultrasonic patterning was investigated to obtain good
   replication characteristics of micro-patterns with uniformity thorough
   the entire pattern area. Finite element analyses were conducted to
   predict the vibration characteristics of the tool horn. Statistical
   analysis using the response surface method was concurrently performed to
   find the optimal design conditions to ensure high and uniform pattern
   replicability. Experimental verifications were then followed by
   application of the proposed horn design.

AB The use of confidence intervals (CIs) as an addition or as an

   promoted as a means to make researchers more aware of the uncertainty
   that is inherent in statistical inference. Little is known, however,
   about whether presenting results via CIs affects how readers judge the
   probability that an effect is present in the population of interest and
   whether a replication would be likely to reveal the same results. In the
   present study, 66 PhD students were asked to interpret statistical
   outcomes presented as CIs or as conventional statistics (t statistics
   and associated p values). Fewer misinterpretations of statistics-such as
   accepting the null hypothesis-and more references to effect size were
   found when results were presented as CIs. Furthermore, participants
   tended to be more certain about the existence of a population effect in
   the expected direction and about the replicability of the results when
   the results were presented following the conventions of NHST than when
   presented using CIs. Contrary to expectations, no evidence of a more
   precipitous drop in the belief of the existence of a population effect
   and replicability estimates when p values exceeded the significance
   level of .05 was found when data were presented using NHST instead of by
   CIs.

   do not find that their results are robust to changes in their baseline

AB We discuss three arguments voiced by scientists who view the current
   outpouring of concern about replicability as overblown. The first idea
   is that the adoption of a low alpha level (e.g., 5%) puts reasonable
   bounds on the rate at which errors can enter the published literature,
   making false-positive effects rare enough to be considered a minor
   issue. This, we point out, rests on statistical misunderstanding: The
   alpha level imposes no limit on the rate at which errors may arise in
   the literature (Ioannidis, 2005b). Second, some argue that whereas
   direct replication attempts are uncommon, conceptual replication
   attempts are common-providing an even better test of the validity of a
   phenomenon. We contend that performing conceptual rather than direct
   replication attempts interacts insidiously with publication bias,
   opening the door to literatures that appear to confirm the reality of
   phenomena that in fact do not exist. Finally, we discuss the argument
   that errors will eventually be pruned out of the literature if the field
   would just show a bit of patience. We contend that there are no
   plausible concrete scenarios to back up such forecasts and that what is
   needed is not patience, but rather systematic reforms in scientific
   practice.

   The tendency of psychological science to avoid publishing null results
   produces a situation that limits the replicability assumption of
   science, as replication cannot be meaningful without the potential
   acknowledgment of failed replications. We argue that the field often
   constructs arguments to block the publication and interpretation of null
   results and that null results may be further extinguished through
   questionable researcher practices. Given that science is dependent on
   the process of falsification, we argue that these problems reduce
   psychological science's capability to have a proper mechanism for theory
   falsification, thus resulting in the promulgation of numerous "undead"
   theories that are ideologically popular but have little basis in fact.

   experimenter bias and demand characteristics. We report a content
   analysis of the method section of experiments reported in two psychology
   journals (Psychological Science and the Journal of Personality and
   Social Psychology), focusing on aspects of the procedure associated with
   these two phenomena, such as mention of the presence of the
   experimenter, suspicion probing, and handling of deception. We note that
   such information is very often absent, which prevents observers from
   gauging the extent to which such factors influence the results. We
   consider the reasons that may explain this omission, including the
   automatization of psychology experiments, the evolution of research
   topics, and, most important, a view of research participants as passive
   receptacles of stimuli. Using a situated social cognition perspective,
   we emphasize the importance of integrating the social context of
   experiments in the explanation of psychological phenomena. We illustrate
   this argument via a controversy on stereotype-based behavioral priming
   effects.

AB Several influential publications have sensitized the community of
   behavioral scientists to the dangers of inflated effects and
   false-positive errors leading to the unwarranted publication of
   nonreplicable findings. This issue has been related to prominent cases
   of data fabrication and survey results pointing to bad practices in
   empirical science. Although we concur with the motives behind these
   critical arguments, we note that an isolated debate of false positives
   may itself be misleading and counter-productive. Instead, we argue that,
   given the current state of affairs in behavioral science, false
   negatives often constitute a more serious problem. Referring to Wason's
   (1960) seminal work on inductive reasoning, we show that the failure to
   assertively generate and test alternative hypotheses can lead to
   dramatic theoretical mistakes, which cannot be corrected by any kind of
   rigor applied to statistical tests of the focal hypotheses. We conclude
   that a scientific culture rewarding strong inference (Platt, 1964) is
   more likely to see progress than a culture preoccupied with tightening
   its standards for the mere publication of original findings.

AB Objective: Our aim was to assess the effectiveness and reliability of
   spatiotemporal signal space separation (tSSS) and movement correction
   (MC) in magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings disturbed by head
   movements and magnetized material on the head.
   Methods: We recorded MEG from 20 healthy adults in stationary
   (reference) head position and during controlled head movements. Nearby
   magnetic interference sources were simulated by attaching magnetized
   particles on the subject's head. Auditory and somatosensory stimuli were
   presented. MC, tSSS and averaging were performed to obtain auditory
   (AEF) and somatosensory (SEF) evoked fields. Neuronal sources were
   modeled as equivalent current dipoles. MC was also validated by
   reconstructing signals generated by current dipoles in a phantom.
   Results: After MC, the AEF and SEF responses recorded during
   intermittent head movements were similar in amplitude to the reference
   recordings and differed by 5-7 mm in source location. The tSSS method
   removed artifacts due to the attached magnetized particles but did not
   affect the reference data.
   Conclusions: The methods are able to reliably recover MEG responses
   contaminated by movements and magnetic artifacts on the head.
   Significance: The combination of tSSS and MC methods is especially
   useful in clinical measurements, where movements and magnetic
   disturbances are commonly present. (C) 2012 International Federation of

AB Herpes keratitis is one of the most severe pathologies associated with
   the herpes simplex virus-type 1 ( HSV-1). Herpes keratitis is currently
   the leading cause of both cornea-derived and infection-associated
   blindness in the developed world. Typical presentation of herpes
   keratitis includes infection of the corneal epithelium and sometimes the
   deeper corneal stroma and endothelium, leading to such permanent corneal
   pathologies as scarring, thinning, and opacity (1).
   Corneal HSV-1 infection is traditionally studied in two types of
   experimental models. The in vitro model, in which cultured monolayers of
   corneal epithelial cells are infected in a Petri dish, offers
   simplicity, high level of replicability, fast experiments, and
   relatively low costs. On the other hand, the in vivo model, in which
   animals such as rabbits or mice are inoculated directly in the cornea,
   offers a highly sophisticated physiological system, but has higher
   costs, longer experiments, necessary animal care, and a greater degree
   of variability.
   In this video article, we provide a detailed demonstration of a new ex
   vivo model of corneal epithelial HSV-1 infection, which combines the
   strengths of both the in vitro and the in vivo models. The ex vivo model
   utilizes intact corneas organotypically maintained in culture and
   infected with HSV-1. The use of the ex vivo model allows for highly
   physiologically-based conclusions, yet it is rather inexpensive and
   requires time commitment comparable to that of the in vitro model.

AB K-means is one of the most widely used clustering algorithms in various
   disciplines, especially for large datasets. However the method is known
   to be highly sensitive to initial seed selection of cluster centers.
   K-means++ has been proposed to overcome this problem and has been shown
   to have better accuracy and computational efficiency than k-means. In
   many clustering problems though - such as when classifying georeferenced
   data for mapping applications - standardization of clustering
   methodology, specifically, the ability to arrive at the same cluster
   assignment for every run of the method i.e. replicability of the
   methodology, may be of greater significance than any perceived measure
   of accuracy, especially when the solution is known to be non-unique, as
   in the case of k-means clustering. Here we propose a simple initial seed
   selection algorithm for k-means clustering along one attribute that
   draws initial cluster boundaries along the "deepest valleys" or greatest
   gaps in dataset. Thus, it incorporates a measure to maximize distance
   between consecutive cluster centers which augments the conventional
   k-means optimization for minimum distance between cluster center and
   cluster members. Unlike existing initialization methods, no additional
   parameters or degrees of freedom are introduced to the clustering
   algorithm. This improves the replicability of cluster assignments by as
   much as 100% over k-means and k-means++, virtually reducing the variance
   over different runs to zero, without introducing any additional
   parameters to the clustering process. Further, the proposed method is
   more computationally efficient than k-means++ and in some cases, more
   accurate. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Flowshop scheduling is a very active research area. This problem still
   attracts a considerable amount of interest despite the sheer amount of
   available results. Total flowtime minimization of a flowshop has been
   actively studied and many effective algorithms have been proposed in the
   last few years. New best solutions have been found for common benchmarks
   at a rapid pace. However, these improvements many times come at the cost
   of sophisticated algorithms. Complex methods hinder potential
   applications and are difficult to extend to small problem variations.
   Replicability of results is also a challenge. In this paper, we examine
   simple and easy to implement methods that at the same time result in
   state-of-the-art performance. The first two proposed methods are based
   on the well known Iterated Local Search (ILS) and Iterated Greedy (IG)
   frameworks, which have been applied with great success to other flowshop
   problems. Additionally, we present extensions of these methods that work
   over populations, something that we refer to as population-based ILS
   (pILS) and population-based IG (pIGA), respectively. We calibrate the
   presented algorithms by means of the Design of Experiments (DOE)
   approach. Extensive comparative evaluations are carried out against the
   most recent techniques for the considered problem in the literature. The
   results of a comprehensive computational and statistical analysis show
   that the presented algorithms are very effective. Furthermore, we show
   that, despite their simplicity, the presented methods are able to
   improve 12 out of 120 best known solutions of Taillard's flowshop
   benchmark with total flowtime criterion. [All rights reserved Elsevier].

AB Sleep deprivation is a condition that is more and more observed in
   modern society bringing various neurobehavioral effects, being anxious
   states one of the main problems. Many studies have successfully
   demonstrated the relationship between sleep deprivation and anxiety in
   clinical research. As to basic experimentation, various models have been
   efficiently used in order to evaluate an anxious behavior. However, the
   same efficacy is not found on basic studies that deal with the
   relationship between paradoxical sleep and anxiety. The great majority
   of studies which approach this matter in animal models do not present
   results that may be applied to clinical practice and this is basically
   due to two reasons: inconsistency among results and lack of
   replicability as related to clinical studies. It has to be emphasized
   that the use of animal models is extremely useful, mainly under
   experimental conditions which cannot be ethically or plausibly be
   approached in human beings. So, the present theoretical assay tries to
   evaluate in a brief and critical manner the applicability of animal
   models in sleep deprivation under a translational perspective.

AB Stephen Jay Gould argued that replaying the "tape of life" would result
   in a radically different evolutionary outcome. Some biologists and
   philosophers, however, have pointed to convergent evolution as evidence
   for robust replicability in macroevolution. These authors interpret
   homoplasy, or the independent origination of similar biological forms,
   as evidence for the power of natural selection to guide form toward
   certain morphological attractors, notwithstanding the diversionary
   tendencies of drift and the constraints of phylogenetic inertia. In this
   paper, I consider the implications of homoplasy for the debate over the
   nature of macroevolution. I argue that once the concepts of contingency
   and convergence are fleshed out, it becomes clear that many instances of
   homoplasy fail to negate Gould's overarching thesis, and may in fact
   support a Gouldian view of life. My argument rests on the distinction
   between parallelism and convergence, which I defend against a recent
   challenge from developmental biology. I conclude that despite the
   difficulties in defining and identifying parallelism, the concept
   remains useful and relevant to the contingency controversy insofar as it
   underscores the common developmental origins of iterated evolution.

AB Hazardous alcohol use is a well-established risk factor for men's

   the association. The current study extends understanding of the
   hazardous alcohol use-IPV link by examining what factors moderate this
   association in a more systematic and broader way that has been done in
   past studies. Individual, family, workplace, community, and
   developmental factors were tested as moderators of the hazardous alcohol
   use and IPV link in a large, representative sample of active duty
   service members (the 2006 Community Assessment), and the results were
   tested for replicability in a hold-out sample. Two family variables
   (relationship satisfaction and parent-child satisfaction), 1 community
   variable (community safety), and 3 developmental variables (years in the
   military, marital length, and family income/pay grade) cross-validated
   as significant moderators of the association between men's hazardous
   alcohol use and IPV. Across the significant moderators, the association
   between hazardous alcohol use and men's IPV was weakened by
   maturation/development, improved community safety, and better
   relationship functioning. No individual or workplace variables were
   significant moderators for men, and there were no significant moderators
   found for women. The results support the importance of a developmental
   and relational perspective to understanding the hazardous alcohol
   use-IPV link, rather than solely an individual coping perspective.

   young female reproductive clinic patients (Messinger, Davidson, &
   Rickert, 2011) by examining how the adolescent and young adult
   respondents differ. To explore replicability of the adolescent results
   across populations, they are compared to 487 adolescent female students
   sampled from four urban high schools. Across samples, all communication
   strategies were used more frequently within violent relationships.
   Multivariate analysis identified escalating strategies used and received
   as being positively associated with physical violence used and received
   in all three samples. Regarding verbal reasoning and temporary conflict
   avoidance, substantial differences appeared between the young adult and
   adolescent clinic samples, and results from the adolescent clinic sample
   were largely replicated with the adolescent school sample, suggesting
   that young adult samples in this literature are not adequate proxies for
   adolescents.

AB Background: The goal of this study was to test a hypothesis associating
   impulsivity with an elevated body mass index (BMI). Methods: To this
   end, we examined associations of BMI with putative genetic,
   neurophysiological, psychiatric, and psychological indicators of
   impulsivity in 78 women and 74 men formerly dependent on alcohol or
   drugs. A second analysis was designed to test the replicability of the
   genetic findings in an independent sample of 109 women and 111 men with
   a similar history of substance dependence. Results: The results of the
   first analysis showed that BMI was positively correlated with Total and
   Nonplanning Scale Scores on the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale and the
   number of childhood symptoms of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder
   in women. It was also positively correlated, in women, with a GABRA2
   variant previously implicated as a risk factor for substance dependence
   and an objective electroencephalographic feature previously associated
   with GABRA2 and relapse risk. The second analysis confirmed that the
   correlation between BMI and the substance-dependence-associated GABRA2
   genotype was reliable and sex-specific. Conclusions: We conclude that an
   elevated BMI is associated with genetic, neurophysiological,
   psychiatric, and psychological indicators of impulsivity. The sex
   difference may be explained by greater opportunities to eat and overeat,
   a preference for higher calorie foods, a longer duration of alcohol/drug
   abstinence, or previous pregnancies in women. (Am J Addict

AB Background: The population with multiple chronic conditions is growing.
   Prior studies indicate that patients with comorbidities are frequently
   excluded from trials but do not address whether information is available
   in trials to draw conclusions about treatment effects for these
   patients.
   Methods and Findings: We conducted a literature survey of trials from 11
   Cochrane Reviews for four chronic diseases (diabetes, heart failure,
   chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and stroke). The Cochrane Reviews
   systematically identified and summarized trials on the effectiveness of
   diuretics, metformin, anticoagulants, longacting beta-agonists alone or
   in combination with inhaled corticosteroids, lipid lowering agents,
   exercise and diet. Eligible studies were reports of trials included in
   the Cochrane reviews and additional papers that described the methods of
   these trials. We assessed the exclusion and inclusion of people with
   comorbidities, the reporting of comorbidities, and whether comorbidities
   were considered as potential modifiers of treatment effects. Overall,
   the replicability of both the inclusion criteria (mean [standard
   deviation (SD)]: 6.0 (2.1), range (min-max): 1-9.5) and exclusion
   criteria(mean(SD): 5.3 (2.1), range: 1-9.5) was only moderate. Trials
   excluded patients with many common comorbidities. The proportion of
   exclusions for comorbidities ranged from 042 percent for heart failure,
   0-55 percent for COPD, 0-44 percent for diabetes, and 0-39 percent for
   stroke. Seventy of the 161 trials (43.5%) described the prevalence of
   any comorbidity among participants with the index disease. The reporting
   of comorbidities in trials was very limited, in terms of reporting an
   operational definition and method of ascertainment for the presence of
   comorbidity and treatments for the comorbidity. It was even less common
   that the trials assessed whether comorbidities were potential modifiers
   of treatment effects.
   Conclusions: Comorbidities receive little attention in chronic disease
   trials. Given the public health importance of people with multiple
   chronic conditions, trials should better report on comorbidities and
   assess the effect comorbidities have on treatment outcomes.

AB The financial viability of Social Security, the single largest U.S.
   government program, depends on accurate forecasts of the solvency of its
   intergenerational trust fund. We begin by detailing information
   necessary for replicating the Social Security Administration's (SSA's)
   forecasting procedures, which until now has been unavailable in the
   public domain. We then offer a way to improve the quality of these
   procedures via age- and sex-specific mortality forecasts. The most
   recent SSA mortality forecasts were based on the best available
   technology at the time, which was a combination of linear extrapolation
   and qualitative judgments. Unfortunately, linear extrapolation excludes
   known risk factors and is inconsistent with long-standing demographic
   patterns, such as the smoothness of age profiles. Modern statistical
   methods typically outperform even the best qualitative judgments in
   these contexts. We show how to use such methods, enabling researchers to
   forecast using far more information, such as the known risk factors of
   smoking and obesity and known demographic patterns. Including this extra
   information makes a substantial difference. For example, by improving
   only mortality forecasting methods, we predict three fewer years of net
   surplus, $730 billion less in Social Security Trust Funds, and program
   costs that are 0.66% greater for projected taxable payroll by 2031
   compared with SSA projections. More important than specific numerical
   estimates are the advantages of transparency, replicability, reduction
   of uncertainty, and what may be the resulting lower vulnerability to the
   politicization of program forecasts. In addition, by offering with this
   article software and detailed replication information, we hope to
   marshal the efforts of the research community to include ever more
   informative inputs and to continue to reduce uncertainties in Social
   Security forecasts.

AB Background: The first step in the analysis of a dermatoscopically imaged
   melanocytic lesion is segmentation informally, isolating those points in
   the image belonging to the lesion from those belonging to the
   surrounding non-lesional skin. Although typically studied in the context
   of automated analysis, segmentation is a necessary step even for human
   operators who plan to evaluate quantitative features of a lesion (such
   as diameter or asymmetry). Methods: In a double blind evaluation of the
   segmentation of 77 digital dermatoscopic images, we observed a
   significant inter-operator variability. Results: The area of the
   disagreement region was on average 15.28% of the area of the lesion
   itself, and in 10% of the cases it was more than 28%. More experienced
   dermatologists showed greater agreement among themselves than with less
   experienced dermatologists, and a slight tendency toward tighter
   segmentations. Conclusion: The evaluation methodology addresses a number
   of crucial difficulties encountered in previous studies and may be of
   independent interest. Our results underscore the necessity of taking
   into account inter-operator variability in large epidemiological
   studies, in particular those involving less experienced dermatologists,
   and of striving toward techniques allowing greater standardization and
   replicability in the evaluation of the fundamental visual parameters of
   lesions.

AB Introduction: Through The Global Plan Towards the Elimination of New HIV
   Infections Among Children by 2015 and Keeping their Mothers Alive,
   leaders have called for broader action to strengthen the involvement of
   communities. The Global Plan aspires to reduce new HIV infections among
   children by 90 percent, and to reduce AIDS-related maternal mortality by
   half. This article summarizes the results of a review commissioned by
   UNAIDS to help inform stakeholders on promising practices in community
   engagement to accelerate progress towards these ambitious goals.
   Methods: This research involved extensive literature review and key
   informant interviews. Community engagement was defined to include
   participation, mobilization and empowerment while excluding activities
   that involve communities solely as service recipients. A promising
   practice was defined as one for which there is documented evidence of
   its effectiveness in achieving intended results and some indication of
   replicability, scale up and/or sustainability.
   Results: Promising practices that increased the supply of preventing
   mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) services included extending
   community cadres, strengthening linkages with community- and faith-based
   organizations and civic participation in programme monitoring. Practices
   to improve demand for PMTCT included community-led social and behaviour
   change communication, peer support and participative approaches to
   generate local solutions. Practices to create an enabling environment
   included community activism and government leadership for greater
   involvement of communities.
   Committed leadership at all levels, facility, community, district and
   national, is crucial to success. Genuine community engagement requires a
   rights-based, capacity-building approach and sustained financial and
   technical investment. Participative formative research is a first step
   in building community capacity and helps to ensure programme relevance.
   Building on existing structures, rather than working in parallel to
   them, improves programme efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability.
   Monitoring, innovation and information sharing are critical to scale up.
   Conclusions: Ten recommendations on community engagement are offered for
   ending vertical transmission and enhancing the health of mothers and
   families: (1) expand the frontline health workforce, (2) increase
   engagement with community- and faith-based organizations, (3) engage
   communities in programme monitoring and accountability, (4) promote
   community- driven social and behaviour change communication including
   grassroots campaigns and dialogues, (5) expand peer support, (6) empower
   communities to address programme barriers, (7) support community
   activism for political commitment, (8) share tools for community
   engagement, (9) develop better indicators for community involvement and
   (10) conduct cost analyses of various community engagement strategies.
   As programmes expand, care should be taken to support and not to
   undermine work that communities are already doing, but rather to
   actively identify and build on such efforts.

   psychological insight. The most interesting and important manifestations
   of personality are diverse and consequential behaviours that are related
   because they really do reflect common underlying traits. Thus, the

AB A 1-hour temperature-based toxicity test using Daphnia magna was
   developed and then compared with a 24-hour standard acute toxicity test.
   The 1-hour toxicity test was based on the observation that daphnids in
   high temperatures become weak and more susceptible to toxicants than
   daphnids at room temperature. Theorizing that this relationship could be
   utilized to produce a short-term toxicity test, we analyzed the
   experimental data and identified 36.5 degrees C as the ideal temperature
   for a 1-hour temperature-based toxicity test. After the test was
   formulated, it was used to screen 15 toxicants. Eight heavy metals, 4
   pesticides, 2 anions, phenol, and 2 industrial wastewaters were
   screened, using the 1-hour toxicity test and the 24-hour standard acute
   toxicity test. For the 1-hour toxicity test, vials containing 5 daphnids
   (<24 h), medium, and toxicant, all at room temperature, were prepared
   and placed in a water bath set at 36.5 degrees C for 1 hour. After 1
   hour, the numbers of live (no toxic effect) daphnids and immobilized
   (toxic effect) daphnids were counted, and the median effective
   concentrations (EC50) were determined.
   A comparison of the EC50 values of the 1-hour temperature-based toxicity
   test and those of the 24-hour standard acute toxicity test produced a
   correlation of 0.9999. When individual toxicants were compared, the
   24-hour standard acute toxicity test was better at detecting lower test
   concentrations than the 1-hour temperature-based toxicity test. When
   both tests were used to screen industrial wastewater and their results
   were compared, the 1-hour toxicity test showed some promise. However,
   further testing will need to be done, because only 2 of the 10 samples
   collected initially contained significant amounts of toxicants for EC50
   calculation. Finally, while the 1-hour toxicity test was effective in
   screening 15 tested toxicants and has the potential to be useful in
   screening industrial wastewater, this conclusion is limited to those 15
   tested toxicants and 2 industrial wastewaters. Additional experiments
   will be needed for other toxicants. The 1-hour toxicity test presented
   in this study is the first temperature-based toxicity test developed for
   D. magna, and it will be an attractive short-term assay for its
   convenience, cost-efficiency, and replicability.

AB Depression affects 20-30% of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in the
   U.S. and predicts greater sexual risk behaviors, lower antiretroviral
   (ARV) medication adherence, and worse clinical outcomes. Yet little
   experimental evidence addresses the critical clinical question of
   whether depression treatment improves ARV adherence and clinical
   outcomes in PLWHA with depression. The Strategies to Link Antidepressant
   and Antiretroviral Management at Duke, UAB, and UNC (SLAM DUNC) Study is
   a randomized clinical effectiveness trial funded by the National
   Institute for Mental Health. The objective of SLAM DUNC is to test
   whether a depression treatment program integrated into routine HIV
   clinical care affects ARV adherence. PLWHA with depression (n = 390) are
   randomized to enhanced usual care or a depression treatment model called
   Measurement-Based Care (MBC). MBC deploys a clinically supervised
   Depression Care Manager (DCM) to provide evidence-based antidepressant
   treatment recommendations to a non-psychiatric prescribing provider,
   guided by systematic and ongoing measures of depressive symptoms and
   side effects. MBC has limited time requirements and the DCM role can be
   effectively filled by a range of personnel given appropriate training
   and supervision, enhancing replicability. In SLAM DUNC, MBC is
   integrated. into HIV care to support HIV providers in antidepressant
   prescription and management. The primary endpoint is ARV adherence
   measured by unannounced telephone-based pill counts at 6 months with
   follow-up to 12 months and secondary endpoints including viral load,
   health care utilization, and depressive severity. Important outcomes of
   this study will be evidence of the effectiveness of MBC in treating
   depression in PLWHA and improving HIV-related outcomes. (C) 2012

AB This article reports a novel infrared (IR)-assisted roll-to-roll
   embossing method, which enables the replication of microfeatures onto
   the surfaces of flexible polymer substrates. An IR-assisted roll-to-roll
   embossing facility was designed and built in our laboratory especially
   for this study. Metallic rollers bearing micropatterns of two different
   feature sizes, namely 150 and 20 mu m in depth, were employed. The
   former one was prepared by microelectric discharge machining the roller,
   whereas the latter was fabricated by electroplating a thin layer of
   nickel on the surface of the roller, followed by a diamond turning
   process to create the microstructures. The embossing facility was used
   to replicate the microstructure onto polyethylene terephthalate and
   polycarbonate films in the experiments. During roller embossing, the IR
   radiation shed on the rollers, and the energy was converted into heat to
   melt the polymer substrates and to replicate the microstructures. The
   influence of various processing parameters on the replicability of
   microfeatures was investigated. Under the proper processing conditions,
   double-sided flexible polymer substrates with microstructures could be
   successfully fabricated. The proposed method shows great potential for
   fabrication of micro-optical components due to its simplicity and
   versatility. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 2012. (C) 2012 Society of Plastics

   bodies. It is composed of a Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) created in
   2007, SDI-OTALEX (www.ideotalex.eu), which is an exchange platform for
   geographic information and Webmapping services among project partners.
   The integration of environmental indicators such as landscape
   indicators, for the characterization and monitoring of the Alentejo
   Extremadura area is one of the most relevant components of the project.
   This paper reports the achievements in defining Local Landscape Units
   (LLU) for a pilot area of Central Alentejo - the Pardiela river basin.
   The methodological approach applied Geographic Information System tools
   to integrate soils, geomorphology and land cover. The land cover map
   applies the CORINE Land Cover Legend Level 5 to Central Alentejo at a
   scale of 1 : 10,000. This map contains variables related to vegetation,
   hydrology (streams and water bodies) and human settlements (buildings,
   equipment, roads). The validation of the results obtained for LLU with
   previously defined Landscape Units and potential vegetation mapping
   confirm the reliability and replicability of the present methodology for
   similar territories.

AB Purpose: Prostate cancer patients often suffer from treatment-associated
   morbidities which lead to severe physical and mental impairments.
   Nevertheless, only a relatively small percentage of this patient
   population uses medical rehabilitation services; there is still a lack
   of evidence concerning possible factors causing use and non-use of
   services. Therefore, this study exploratively aims at the identification
   of predictors of the use of rehabilitation services in a cohort of
   prostate cancer patients.
   Method: In a prospective multicentre study to evaluate outpatient
   oncological rehabilitation services, n=242 prostate cancer patients who
   used outpatient or inpatient rehabilitation services ("users") were
   compared with n=253 prostate cancer patients who did not use
   rehabilitation ("non-users") at measure point 1. At the beginning of the
   rehabilitation programme and at the end of primary treatment,
   respectively, patients completed a self-report questionnaire consisting
   of standardized instruments designed to assess the following independent
   variables: autonomy striving (TPF), self-efficacy expectancy (GSE),
   distress (distress thermometer), anxiety and depression (HADS-D),
   quality of life (SF-8), social support (SSUK), rehabilitation
   motivation: readiness to change, knowledge, scepticism regarding
   rehabilitation services (PAREMO-20). Illness- and treatment-related
   variables (tumour state, comorbidity, primary therapies) were documented
   by the attending oncologists.
   Results: Only few significant and effective differences between
   rehabilitation users and non-users are observed: Non-users are suffering
   more often from gastrointestinal comorbidities (18% vs. 2%, w=0.25).
   Both patient groups report severe quality-of-life impairments,
   particularly with respect to their physical functioning. Non-users
   achieve significantly higher scores on the scale "scepticism"
   (PAREMO-20) than users (eta(2)=0.19). The scale "scepticism" is also
   identified as the dominant predictor of utilization of rehabilitation
   services (R-2=0.23). Suffering from comorbid diseases of the digestive
   system, self-efficacy expectation and employment status emerge as
   further significant predictors (R-2=0.12, and R-2=0.02 each). With
   increasing scepticism and in case of comorbidity the probability of
   rehabilitation utilization was decreasing.
   Conclusion: Besides illness-related variables prostate cancer patients'
   expectancies regarding the effectiveness of rehabilitation services to
   alleviate their medical conditions seem to be more relevant for
   rehabilitation utilization than sociodemographic variables or
   psychosocial distress. Further studies should investigate the
   replicability of these results and should focus on the
   doctor-patient-communication and the amount of information about goals
   and concepts of rehabilitation services prostate cancer patients are
   told. For clinical practice of information-giving about rehabilitation
   services it can be recommended not only to assess patients' physical and
   mental conditions but also to explore their expectations and concerns
   about rehabilitative treatment options in order to remove any doubts and
   to be able to optimize oncological care.

AB Objective: The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a widely used
   measure of subjective sleep disturbance in clinical populations,
   including individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
   Although the severity of sleep disturbance is generally represented by a
   global symptom score, recent factor analytic studies suggest that the
   PSQI is better characterized by a two- or three-factor model than a
   one-factor model. This study examined the replicability of two- and
   three-factor models of the PSQI, as well as the relationship between
   PSQI factors and health outcomes, in a female sample with PTSD.
   Methods: The PSQI was administered to 319 women with PTSD related to
   sexual or physical assault. Confirmatory factor analyses tested the
   relative fit of one-, two-, and three-factor solutions. Bivariate
   correlations were performed to examine the shared variance between PSQI
   sleep factors and measures of PTSD, depression, anger, and physical
   symptoms.
   Results: Confirmatory factor analyses supported a three-factor model
   with Sleep Efficiency, Perceived Sleep Quality, and Daily Disturbances
   as separate indices of sleep quality. The severity of symptoms
   represented by the PSQI factors was positively associated with the
   severity of PTSD, depression, and physical symptoms. However, these
   health outcomes correlated as much or more with the global PSQI score as
   with PSQI factor scores.
   Conclusions: These results support the multidimensional structure of the
   PSQI. Despite this, the global PSQI score has as much or more
   explanatory power as individual PSQI factors in predicting health
   outcomes. Published by Elsevier B.V.

   enable overall operationalization of energy access in developing

   that are based on established success, replicability and potential for
   scaling up has been examined through two case-studies, namely the

   during reciprocal interactions, while all genotypes displayed normal
   adult sociability on the three-chambered task. Impaired novel object
   recognition and rotarod performance were consistent across cohorts of
   null mutants. Repetitive self-grooming, reduced ultrasonic
   vocalizations, and deficits in reversal of water maze learning were
   detected only in some cohorts, emphasizing the importance of replication
   analyses. These results demonstrate the exquisite specificity of
   deletions in discrete domains within the Shank3 gene in determining
   severity of symptoms.

AB Background. Symptom dimensions have not yet been comprehensively tested
   as predictors of the substantial heterogeneity in outcomes of
   antidepressant treatment in major depressive disorder.
   Method. We tested nine symptom dimensions derived from a previously
   published factor analysis of depression rating scales as predictors of
   outcome in 811 adults with moderate to severe depression treated with
   flexibly dosed escitalopram or nortriptyline in Genome-based Therapeutic
   Drugs for Depression (GENDEP). The effects of symptom dimensions were
   tested in mixed-effect regression models that controlled for overall
   initial depression severity, age, sex and recruitment centre.
   Significant results were tested for replicability in 3637 adult
   out-patients with non-psychotic major depression treated with citalopram
   in level I of Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression
   (STAR*D).
   Results. The interest-activity symptom dimension (reflecting low
   interest, reduced activity, indecisiveness and lack of enjoyment) at
   baseline strongly predicted poor treatment outcome in GENDEP,
   irrespective of overall depression severity, antidepressant type and
   outcome measure used. The prediction of poor treatment outcome by the
   interest-activity dimension was robustly replicated in STAR*D,
   independent of a comprehensive list of baseline covariates.
   Conclusions. Loss of interest, diminished activity and inability to make
   decisions predict poor outcome of antidepressant treatment even after
   adjustment for overall depression severity and other clinical
   covariates. The prominence of such symptoms may require additional
   treatment strategies and should be accounted for in future
   investigations of antidepressant response.

AB With the emergence of online publishing, opportunities to maximize
   transparency of scientific research have grown considerably. However,
   these possibilities are still only marginally used. We argue for the
   implementation of (1) peer-reviewed peer review, (2) transparent
   editorial hierarchies, and (3) online data publication. First,
   peer-reviewed peer review entails a community-wide review system in
   which reviews are published online and rated by peers. This ensures
   accountability of reviewers, thereby increasing academic quality of
   reviews. Second, reviewers who write many highly regarded reviews may
   move to higher editorial positions. Third, online publication of data
   ensures the possibility of independent verification of inferential
   claims in published papers. This counters statistical errors and overly
   positive reporting of statistical results. We illustrate the benefits of
   the sestrategies by discussing an example in which the classical
   publication system has gone awry, namely controversial IQ research. We
   argue that this case would have likely been avoided using more
   transparent publication practices. We argue that the proposed system
   leads to better reviews, meritocratic editorial hierarchies, and a
   higher degree of replicability of statistical analyses.

AB The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is increasingly used in

   racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse backgrounds at risk
   for depression. However, we know little about its factor structure
   across groups of women with implications for measuring symptom levels in
   research. This study evaluated the underlying structure of the EPDS
   using a confirmatory factor analyses model comparison approach of five
   factor models from the literature in a purposive community sample of 169
   postpartum African American women of low socioeconomic status.
   Participants were identified through an exhaustive review of local
   health department program files dated August 2006 to August 2010 in a
   Midwestern state of USA. Tuohy and McVey's (Br JClin Psychol 47:153-169,
   2008) three-factor model (depression, anxiety, and anhedonia)
   demonstrated the best fit to the data with a nonsignificant
   Satora-Bentler scaled chi-square value (21.70, df=24, p=0.60) and the
   lowest root mean square error of approximation (0.00) and standardized
   root mean square residual (0.05) values. The results call for further
   study of the factor structure of the EPDS in other racial and ethnic
   groups and cautious use of the EPDS among perinatal women of racially,
   ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse backgrounds until its
   factorial invariance is better understood.

AB Positive relationships with skilled frontline staff are critical to
   positive youth outcomes (Bouffard & Little, 2004), and yet many youth
   workers are insufficiently prepared to deal with these complex
   environments (Casey Foundation, 2003). There is also concern that there
   is little motivation for frontline youth workers to stay in a field rife
   with danger of burnout, feelings of being overwhelmed, and low pay
   (Anderson-Nathe, 2008; Borden, Craig, & Villaruel, 2004). This article
   establishes the important role higher education can play towards
   stabilizing the youth workforce, and posits that coursework that is
   multidisciplinary, relevant to students' jobs, and supported by
   employers is important to the success of college programs.
   The 12-credit Youth Studies Certificate (YSC) was offered by the City
   University of New York (CUNY) to 223 youth workers from 1999 to 2011.
   Coursework addresses the complex field of youth development by recasting
   traditional courses in education, human services, psychology, sociology,
   development, and recreation. Frontline workers combine their practical
   knowledge of the field with the theoretical framework of a college
   course. Additionally, the certificate is an opportunity to develop
   academically and in critical thinking, skills which enhance a worker's
   development and delivery of service in the practice setting.
   Public/private partnership is an important feature of this replicable
   model aimed to build the stability and capacity of the youth development
   field and the workers within it. Recommendations for replicability and
   future research are provided. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Butterflies are widely used in biodiversity surveys, and several methods
   of relative abundance counts have been developed. The most frequently
   used linear transects are praised for a good replicability, but recently
   have been criticised for poor species detecting ability, especially for
   poorly visible or extremely sedentary species. As an alternative, timed
   surveys, based on zigzagging study sites and flexibly checking transient
   butterfly resources, have been proposed by some authors. We tested the
   utility of the two methods while studying the effect of restoration
   practices on butterfly assemblages in limestone quarries in the Czech
   Republic. Numbers of species and individuals detected per 10 min
   transect walk were compared with numbers of species and individuals
   detected during 10 min timed survey. Mobile and imperceptible species
   were compared in separate analyses as a measure of detection efficiency.
   More species and individuals per visit were recorded by timed surveys.
   No difference in detectability of mobile and imperceptible species
   between both methods used was observed. Whereas linear transects will
   probably remain the method of choice for long-term monitoring programs
   employing armies of recorders, timed surveys appear more appropriate for
   studies in which it is important to obtain the most comprehensive
   check-list of species occurring at study sites, which is often the case
   in conservation inventories in species rich regions with limited number
   of experienced researchers.

AB Recent reports have suggested that many published results are
   unreliable. To increase the reliability and accuracy of published
   papers, multiple changes have been proposed, such as changes in
   statistical methods. We support such reforms. However, we believe that
   the incentive structure of scientific publishing must change for such
   reforms to be successful. Under the current system, the quality of
   individual scientists is judged on the basis of their number of
   publications and citations, with journals similarly judged via numbers
   of citations. Neither of these measures takes into account the
   replicability of the published findings, as false or controversial
   results are often particularly widely cited. We propose tracking
   replications as a means of post-publication evaluation, both to help
   researchers identify reliable findings and to incentivize the
   publication of reliable results. Tracking replications requires a
   database linking published studies that replicate one another. As any
   such database is limited by the number of replication attempts
   published, we propose establishing an open-access journal dedicated to
   publishing replication attempts. Data quality of both the database and
   the affiliated journal would be ensured through a combination of
   crowd-sourcing and peer review. As reports in the database are
   aggregated, ultimately it will be possible to calculate replicability
   scores, which may be used alongside citation counts to evaluate the
   quality of work published in individual journals. In this paper, we lay
   out a detailed description of how this system could be implemented,
   including mechanisms for compiling the information, ensuring data
   quality, and incentivizing the research community to participate.

AB As new analytical techniques are brought to sourcing studies and
   researchers compile data into multi-laboratory databases, systematic
   evaluation is essential. The importance of precision and accuracy is
   clear, but Shackley (2005) also calls for "archaeological accuracy."
   Hughes (1998) offered a framework to consider precision and accuracy
   alongside the concepts of reliability and validity. These four concepts
   can serve as a foundation to evaluate archaeological sourcing data and
   procedures, but adoption of Hughes' framework has been nearly
   nonexistent. Unfortunately, Hughes' formulations of reliability and
   validity are somewhat at odds with their conventional definitions,
   hindering his framework. Furthermore, the concept of precision has
   become outdated in analytical circles, and superfluous terms (e. g.,
   replicability) have emerged in the archaeological literature. Here I
   consider the basis of Hughes' framework and how its four components,
   when applied consistently by the sourcing community, are best applied to
   evaluate analytical data and techniques for sourcing. (C) 2012 Wiley

AB The purpose of this study was to identify subgroups of adult basic

   reading components of decoding, word recognition, spelling, fluency, and
   comprehension. The analysis uses factor scores of those 5 reading
   components from on a prior investigation of the reliability and
   construct validity of measures of reading component skills (MacArthur,
   Konold, Glutting, & Alamprese, 2010). In that investigation,
   confirmatory factor analysis found that a model with those 5 factors fit
   the data best and fit equally well for native and non-native English
   speakers. The study included 486 students, 334 born or educated in the
   United States (native) and 152 not born nor educated in the US
   (non-native) but who spoke English well enough to participate in English
   reading classes. The cluster analysis found an 8-cluster solution with
   good internal cohesion, external isolation, and replicability across
   subsamples. Of the 8 subgroups, 4 had relatively flat profiles (range of
   mean scores across factors < 0.5 SD), 2 had higher comprehension than
   decoding, and 2 had higher decoding than comprehension. Profiles were
   consistent with expectations regarding demographic factors. Non-native
   speakers were overrepresented in subgroups with relatively higher
   decoding and underrepresented in subgroups with relatively higher
   comprehension. Adults with self-reported learning disabilities were
   overrepresented in the lowest performing subgroup. Older adults and men
   were overrepresented in subgroups with lower performance. The study adds
   to the limited research on the reading skills of ABE learners and, from
   the perspective of practice, supports the importance of assessing
   component skills to plan instruction.

AB Drug discovery for brain disorders is undergoing a period of upheaval.
   Faced with an empty drug pipeline and numerous failures of potential new
   drugs in clinical trials, many large pharmaceutical companies have been
   shrinking or even closing down their research divisions that focus on
   central nervous system (CNS) disorders. In this paper, we argue that
   many of the difficulties facing CNS drug discovery stem from a lack of
   robustness in pre-clinical (i.e., non-human animal) testing. There are
   two main sources for this lack of robustness. First, there is the lack
   of replicability of many results from the pre-clinical stage, which we
   argue is driven by a combination of publication bias and inappropriate
   selection of statistical and experimental designs. Second, there is the
   frequent failure to translate results in non-human animals to parallel
   results in humans in the clinic. This limitation can only be overcome by
   developing new behavioral tests for non-human animals that have
   predictive, construct, and etiological validity. Here, we present these
   translational difficulties as a "grand challenge" to researchers from
   comparative cognition, who are well positioned to provide new methods
   for testing behavior and cognition in non-human animals. These new
   experimental protocols will need to be both statistically robust and
   target behavioral and cognitive processes that allow for better
   connection with human CNS disorders. Our hope is that this downturn in
   industrial research may represent an opportunity to develop new
   protocols that will re-kindle the search for more effective and safer
   drugs for CNS disorders. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   et al [1], using a confirmatory factor analysis for ordinal data.
   Likewise, we explored the measurement invariance of the YSR across
   gender and age using multigroup comparisons, and checked whether there
   were differences in the latent means.
   Methods: The sample was made up of 4,868 nonclinical adolescents (47.6%
   males), with a mean age of 14.6 years (SD = 1.6).
   Results: The correlated eight-syndrome model proposed by Ivanova et al
   [1] showed a reasonable fit to the data, both for the total sample and
   by participants' gender and age. Moreover, the factor-equivalence
   analysis showed that the hypothesized dimensional model was invariant
   across gender and age. Statistically significant differences were found
   when comparing latent means between the groups.
   Conclusions: These results coincide with those found in the literature
   and are in support of the replicability, generalizability, and
   consistency of the eight-syndrome model of the YSR, as well as its
   measurement invariance across gender and age. Future studies should
   explore the measurement invariance of this model through multigroup

AB Introduction. The use of manualized treatment programs offers a useful
   research framework for assessing psychotherapeutic interventions for
   female sexual dysfunctions (FSDs), but it does not address all issues
   related to methodological rigor and replication, and raises new research
   issues in need of discussion.
   Aims. The goals of this manuscript are to review the literature on
   treatment trials utilizing manualized psychotherapy treatments for FSD
   and to explore the benefits and research issues associated with the
   flexible use of treatment manuals.
   Methods. The method used was the review of the relevant literature.
   Results. While the use of manualized treatments for FSDs can address
   certain methodological issues inherent in psychotherapy research,
   flexibility in manual administration is necessary in order to allow
   tailoring for individual needs that can be beneficial to both the
   participant and the research. The flexible use of manuals, as opposed to
   strict manual adherence, may also be more relevant for clinical utility.
   Conclusions. In order to administer manualized treatments for FSDs with
   appropriate flexibility, while also maximizing internal validity and
   replicability, the authors recommend that predetermined decision rules
   be utilized to guide individual tailoring, that potential gaps in the
   manual be identified and addressed, and that differing levels of
   motivation and readiness for treatment be taken into consideration in
   the treatment protocol. Hucker A and McCabe MP. Manualized treatment

AB Business processes have become one of the key assets of organization,
   since these processes allow them to discover and control what occurs in
   their environments, with information systems automating most of an
   organization's processes. Unfortunately, and as a result of uncontrolled
   maintenance, information systems age over time until it is necessary to
   replace them with new and modernized systems. However, while systems are
   aging, meaningful business knowledge that is not present in any of the
   organization's other assets gradually becomes embedded in them. The
   preservation of this knowledge through the recovery of the underlying
   business processes is, therefore, a critical problem. This paper
   provides, as a solution to the aforementioned problem, a model-driven
   procedure for recovering business processes from legacy information
   systems. The procedure proposes a set of models at different abstraction
   levels, along with the model transformations between them. The paper
   also provides a supporting tool, which facilitates its adoption.
   Moreover, a real-life case study concerning an e-government system
   applies the proposed recovery procedure to validate its effectiveness
   and efficiency. The case study was carried out by following a formal
   protocol to improve its rigor and replicability. Copyright (C) 2011 John

AB European Union's legislative mandate on road infrastructure safety is
   limited to the cross-border network. In this framework was issued the
   Directive 2008/96/CE on road infrastructure safety management. The
   implementation of the Directive's guidelines is mandatory only for the
   major European cross boarder highways (TEN-T), while it is well known
   that the highest number of fatalities occurs on the "secondary roads"
   not only in Europe but worldwide. To encourage Member States to apply
   the same guidelines also on national and regional road networks, the
   European Commission co-financed a study with the aim to extend the
   Directive's approach through a common training and education of road
   safety auditors and inspectors, entitled to practice at national and
   international level. This approach is a model in every situation where
   there is a need to train and educate a new generation of road safety
   professionals. The shared procedure will lead to a common standard of
   infrastructure safety management, with the appropriate flexibility to be
   adapted to specific local situations. The high replicability of the
   study's results and recommendations will allow a number of European and
   non-European central and local Authorities to set up their own training
   and certification system. The basic training documentation resulting
   from the project can be adapted to be used wherever requested and
   needed, where urgent upgrade and maintenance of the infrastructure asset
   is badly needed.

AB Computer-based aids for writing assistance have been around since at
   least the early 1980s, focussing primarily on aspects such as spelling,
   grammar and style. The potential audience for such tools is very large
   indeed, and this is a clear case where we might expect to see language
   processing applications having a significant real-world impact. However,
   existing comparative evaluations of applications in this space are often
   no more than impressionistic and anecdotal reviews of commercial
   offerings as found in software magazines, making it hard to determine
   which approaches are superior. More rigorous evaluation in the scholarly
   literature has been held back in particular by the absence of shared
   datasets of texts marked-up with errors, and the lack of an agreed
   evaluation framework. Significant collections of publicly available data
   are now appearing; this paper describes a complementary evaluation
   framework, which has been piloted in the Helping Our Own shared task.
   The approach, which uses stand-off annotations for representing edits to
   text, can be used in a wide variety of text-correction tasks, and easily
   accommodates different error tagsets.

AB Through the use of an iterated learning experiment, we investigate the
   emergence of self-organised structure in a random initial alien
   language, as it is replicated through successive `generations' of
   language learners in three distinct iteration chains. Experiments in the
   iterated learning paradigm have frequently shown that languages evolve
   to become more compositional and thus more easily learnable and
   replicable over the course of an iteration chain (see, e.g., Kirby et
   al. 2008). Here, we closely analyse the dynamics of this replication,
   identifying which features actually correlate with greater
   replicability, as well as suggesting which mechanisms may be driving the
   evolution towards a more replicable language. These findings ultimately
   show us that certain very broad generalisations about language structure
   can be explained purely by appeal to the self-organisational dynamics of
   replication through the cognitive environment of individual language
   learners, even prior to taking social and cultural interaction and
   population dynamics into account.

AB Selecting appropriate suppliers has strategic significance for every

   Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). In many real world applications, data
   are often stochastic. A successful approach to address uncertainty in
   data is to replace deterministic data via random variables, leading to
   chance-constrained DEA. In this paper, a Chance-Constrained FRH (CCFRH)
   model is developed; its deterministic equivalent, which is a nonlinear
   programme, is also derived. Furthermore, it is shown that the
   deterministic equivalent of the CCFRH model can be converted into a
   quadratic programme. In addition, sensitivity analysis of the CCFRH
   model is discussed with respect to changes in parameters. Finally, a

AB Metropolitan WiFi positioning is widely used to complement GPS on mobile
   devices. WiFi positioning typically has very fast time-to-first-fix and
   can provide reliable location information when GPS signals are too weak
   for a position fix. Several commercial WiFi positioning systems have
   been developed in recent years and most newer model smart phones have
   the technology embedded. This study empirically determined the
   performance of WiFi positioning system on two different mobile devices.
   Skyhook's system, running on an iPhone and a laptop, was selected for
   this study. Field work was carried out in three cities at a total of 90
   sites. The positional accuracy of WiFi positioning was found to be very
   similar on the two devices with no statistically significant difference
   between the two error distributions. This suggests that the
   replicability of WiFi positioning on different devices is high based on
   aggregate performance metrics. Median values for positional accuracy in
   the three study areas ranged from 43 to 92 m. These results are similar
   to earlier independent evaluations of Skyhook's system. The number of
   access points (APs) observed on the iPhone was consistently lower than
   that on the laptop. This lower number of APs, however, was not found to
   reduce positional accuracy. In general, no relationship was found
   between the number of APs and positional accuracy for either device,
   counter to earlier findings. The results indicate, however, that WiFi
   positioning can be achieved with a small number of APs (5-10), but that
   increased numbers of APs do not contribute to improved positional
   accuracy. Despite the agreement in aggregate performance metrics between
   the two devices, the replicability of WiFi positioning using Skyhook's
   system in terms of getting the same location by using two different
   devices at approximately the same place and time was relatively poor.
   Implications for location-based services on mobile devices are
   discussed.

AB The temporal annotation scheme Time ML was developed to support research
   in complex temporal question answering (QA). Given the complexity of
   temporal QA, most of the efforts have focused, so far, on extracting
   temporal information, which has been evaluated with corpus-based
   evaluation. However, the QA task represents a natural way to evaluate
   temporal information understanding, and creating question sets is less
   costly for humans than manually annotating temporal information, which
   is required to perform corpus-based evaluation. Additionally, QA
   performance better captures the understanding of important temporal
   information as compared to corpus-based evaluation where all information
   is equally important for scoring. This paper presents a temporal QA
   system that performs temporal reasoning. It can be used to answer
   temporal questions (factoid, list and yes/no), about any document
   annotated in Time ML. In the paper, we show how this system can be used
   to evaluate automated temporal information understanding. Our QA-based
   evaluation results suggest that (i) the available temporal annotations
   are not complete, and (ii) QA provides a less costly and more reliable
   way of evaluating temporal understanding systems. To favour
   replicability, we made the temporal QA system and the question set used
   in the evaluation available.

AB In 1932, Frederic Bartlett laid the foundation for the later schema
   theory. His key assumption of previous knowledge affecting the
   processing of new stimuli was illustrated in the famous "portrait
   d'homme" series. Sequenced reproductions of ambiguous stimuli showed
   progressive object-likeness. As Bartlett pointed out, activation of
   specific schemata, for instance "the face schema", biases memory
   retrieval towards such schemata. In five experiments (Experiment 1, n =
   53; Experiment 2, n = 177; Experiment 3, n = 36; Experiment 4, n = 6;
   Experiment 5, n = 2), we tested several factors potentially influencing
   retrieval biases-for example, by varying the general procedure of
   reproduction (repeated vs. serial) and by omitting versus providing
   visual or semantic cues for activating face schemata. Participants
   inspected face-like stimuli with the caption "portrait of the human" and
   reproduced them repeatedly under specific conditions. None of the
   experiments revealed a systematic tendency towards Bartlett's described
   case, even when the participants were explicitly instructed to draw "a
   face" like the previously inspected one. In one of the "serial
   reproduction" experiments, we even obtained contrary effects with
   decreasing face-likeness over the reproduction generations. A close
   analysis of the original findings raises questions about the
   replicability of Bartlett's findings, qualifying the "portrait d'homme"
   series more or less as an illustrative example of the main idea of
   reconstructive memory.

AB Today, social network sites are a key site for public displays of
   connection and grieving. Mourners weigh the benefits of publicness with
   the problems associated with large and diverse audiences. The
   replicability, scalability, persistence, and searchability features of
   networked publics influence both how mourners grieve and their control
   over depictions of the deceased. This article analyzes a corpus of posts
   and comments on Facebook memorial pages (N = 37). We examine how the
   social and technical affordances of social media, and Facebook in
   particular, affect public displays of grief and portrayals of the
   deceased. The visibility of social media both encourages performative
   displays of mourning and allows wider audiences to pay respects. This
   openness allows for context collapse and potentially unwelcome
   participants such as trolls. We consider the ways in which the
   publicness of the SNS memorial page affects displays of grieving,
   specifically around efforts to engage in impression management of the
   deceased.

AB BACKGROUND:Health quality of life survey in the border minority has a
   practical and political role to improve the public health-care system of
   China.Correlation analysis of body shape and health quality of life in
   Gin residents from the Sino-Vietnamese border is a typical
   representative.OBJECTIVE:To find the main components of body composition
   influencing health quality of life by the related analysis and
   corresponding matrix after rotation and then to evaluate the correlation
   between the body shape and health quality of life in Gin residents from
   the Sino-Vietnamese border.METHODS:From July 2009 to April 2011,the
   in-situ investigation,testing and health questionnaire were used for a
   cross-sectional survey in 361 male Gin residents from the
   Sino-Vietnamese border,aged 20-35 years.The response rate for the
   questionnaire was 100%.SPSS 17.0 software was applied to analyze the
   related indicators,and then initial factor model and rotated factor
   model were established for quantitative correlation analysis between the
   morphological characteristics and health quality of life in Gin
   residents from the Sino-Vietnamese border.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION:All the
   data were included in result analysis.Correlation analysis showed a
   higher relevance among indicators,of which,there was a higher
   correlation in 21 coefficients(P < 0.01),and correlation in 14
   coefficients(P < 0.05).Correlation coefficients accounted for 44.48%.The
   main components influencing the body shape and health quality of life in
   border residents were health life basic quality as the first,life
   happiness index as the second,life happiness as the third,and nutrition
   development as the fourth.Using dimension reduction method,we can
   observe the extremely complex correlation between variables to
   objectively evaluate the health quality of life of the minority
   populations of the border.This method is characterized as
   practicality,generalizability and replicability.

AB As the use of computer simulation is increasingly becoming central to
   scientific enterprise, lack of proper documentation, validation and
   distribution of models and experiments may hamper reproducibility and
   hence cause a credibility gap. Building on prior research requires
   ability to reproduce simulation experiments and to further extend models
   to address increasingly challenging problems. In this article, we
   delineate three dimensions of reproducible research. For each dimension,
   issues, strategies and implications for simulation model development are
   identified. From a technical infrastructure point of view, we introduce
   the e-Portfolio concept, which is an ensemble of integrated active
   documents that interweave published manuscript, computer code, data and
   scientific workflow specification. From the process point of view,
   strategies and potential mechanisms are delineated to enable authors,
   publishers, funding agencies, journals and the broader scientific
   community to cooperate and establish a sustained model base,
   simulations, experiments and documentation, so that scientists can build
   on each other's work and achievements.

AB Purpose - Inconsistent research output makes critical literature reviews
   crucial tools for assessing and developing the knowledge base within a
   research field. Literature reviews in the field of supply chain
   management (SCM) are often considerably less stringently presented than
   other empirical research. Replicability of the research and traceability
   of the arguments and conclusions call for more transparent and
   systematic procedures. The purpose of this paper is to elaborate on the
   importance of literature reviews in SCM.
   Design/methodology/approach - Literature reviews are defined as
   primarily qualitative synthesis. Content analysis is introduced and
   applied for reviewing 22 literature reviews of seven sub-fields of SCM,
   published in English-speaking peer-reviewed journals between 2000 and
   2009. A descriptive evaluation of the literature body is followed by a
   content analysis on the basis of a specific pattern of analytic
   categories derived from a typical research process.
   Findings - Each paper was assessed for the aim of research, the method
   of data gathering, the method of data analysis, and quality measures.
   While some papers provide information on all of these categories, many
   fail to provide all the information. This questions the quality of the
   literature review process and the findings presented in respective
   papers.
   Research limitations/implications - While 22 literature reviews are
   taken into account in this paper as the basis of the empirical analysis,
   this allows for assessing the range of procedures applied in previous
   literature reviews and for pointing to their strengths and shortcomings.
   Originality/value - The findings and subsequent methodological
   discussions aim at providing practical guidance for SCM researchers on
   how to use content analysis for conducting literature reviews.

AB The paper addresses the methodological commonalities linking
   quantitative and qualitative methodologies. It offers a three
   dimensional framework of research methodology that spans the assumed
   divide and shows that quantitative and qualitative research approaches
   can be mutually complementary and offer a more nuanced approximation of
   the truth. The framework, Research methodology in 3D, is based on a
   meta-methodological analysis and consists of three root dimensions,
   namely, firstly, four constituent components presented in all forms of
   research (concepts, questions/hypotheses, observation/measurement and
   communication). The second dimension of the framework consists of the
   core set of criteria that all scientific research must comply with
   (reliability, validity, 'objectivity' and replicability), each may be
   expressed under different labels and in different forms depending on the
   specific research tradition. The third dimension represents the basic
   goals of research, viz. to describe, to explain or to understand. A
   three dimensional framework emerges when the above dimensions are
   combined. The framework shows some of the tangent planes between
   quantitative and qualitative scientific research and suggests possible
   complementarity between research approaches. The framework furthermore
   serves at least the following functions: firstly, as map to assist
   students in charting their way through a maze of new concepts. Secondly,
   the framework is a useful planning instrument for comprehensive and
   complex research programmes. Thirdly, the framework can be utilized as a
   useful guide in evaluating research proposals on the one hand and
   research reports, on the other.

AB This paper takes it as its target to optimize the Fisher method of
   monitoring sites in comprehensive assessment of the soil pollution
   situation.To achieve our goal,we have sorted ordinal samples properly to
   make the discrepancies maximization in different categories and
   minimization in the same category.We have also applied the error
   functions relating to the sum total of the category diameters to
   estimate the discrepancy of different categories.After that,we have
   tested the rationality of the above classification results by F-detected
   and t-detected methods.The above steps taken,we began to explore the
   applicability of the optimal sites selection to the comprehensive
   assessment of heavy metals in the soil according to the basic Fisher
   theory.While proceeding with our assessment experiments,we have chosen
   the estuary wetland of Minjiang River in Fujian Province as a case study
   sample.To begin with,we have gained the diameters of various categories
   from a series of calculation of the synthetic pollution indexes and a
   number of the optimized monitoring sites with the changing tendency of
   the minimum error functions.Then,we have taken the situations of
   pollution-causing sources into account to decide on the most desirable
   monitoring locations.The results of our study show that the eight
   original monitoring sites of the estuary wetland along the Minjiang
   River have been optimized into three typical sites,that is,those of
   Langqidaqiao,Shanyutan and Meihuazhen.Combining the detected method with
   the data information analysis of the three sites above,we have finally
   arrived at the conclusion that the comprehensive assessment results of
   heavy metals pollution of the said estuary wetland prove to be able to
   reflect the pollution situation objectively.Though the connotation of
   Fisher method may seem to be intuitive and clear-cut,it is essential to
   help to identify the corresponding management practices in favor of
   improving the soil quality in monitoring network design.It also proves
   to be of great value to the replicability and reliable assessment
   results.The clustering effect of optimized layout for monitoring points
   based on the proposed method was increased due to eliminating redundant
   monitoring sites.From the method we have improved above,it can be seen
   that the Fisher optimal dissection method proves to be a useful
   decision-supporting tool for expanding the application areas in other
   optimized environment monitoring sites selection.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to integrate existing body of
   knowledge on evidence-based management, develop a theory of evidence,
   and propose a model of evidence-based decision making.
   Design/methodology/approach - Following a literature review, the paper
   takes a conceptual approach toward developing a theory of evidence and a
   process model of decision making. Formal research propositions amplify
   both theory and model.
   Findings - The paper suggests that decision making is at the heart of
   management practice. It underscores the importance of both research and
   experiential evidence for making professionally sound managerial
   decisions. It argues that the strength of evidence is a function of its
   rigor and relevance manifested by methodological fit, relevance to the
   context, transparency of its findings, replicability of the evidence,
   and the degree of consensus within the decision community. A multi-stage
   mixed level model of evidence-based decision making is proposed with
   suggestions for future research.
   Practical implications - An explicit, formal, and systematic
   collaboration at the global level among the producers of evidence and
   its users akin to the Cochrane Collaboration will ensure sound evidence,
   contribute to decision quality, and enable professionalization of
   management practice.
   Originality/value - The unique value contribution of this paper comes
   from a critical review of the evidence-based management literature, the
   articulation of a formal theory of evidence, and the development of a
   model for decision making driven by the theory of evidence.

AB Background: Some scientific fields, such as automobile, drugs discovery
   or engineer have used simulation-based studies (SBS) to faster the
   observation of phenomena and evolve knowledge. All of them organize
   their working structure to perform computerized experiments based on
   explicit research protocols and evidence. The benefits have been many
   and great advancements are continuously obtained for the society.
   However, could the same approach be observed in Software Engineering
   (SE)? Are there research protocols and evidence based models available
   in SE for supporting SBS? Are the studies reports good enough to support
   their understanding and replication? AIM: To characterize SBS in SE and
   organize a set of reporting guidelines aiming at improving SBS'
   understandability, replicability, generalization and validity. METHOD:
   To undertake a secondary study to characterize SBS. Besides, to assess
   the quality of reports to understand the usually reported information
   regarding SBS. RESULTS: From 108 selected papers, it has been observed
   several relevant initiatives regarding SBS in software engineering.
   However, most of the reports lack information concerned with the
   research protocol, simulation model building and evaluation, used data,
   among others. SBS results are usually specific, making their
   generalization and comparison hard. No reporting standard has been
   observed. CONCLUSIONS: Advancements can be observed in SBS in Software
   Engineering. However, the lack of reporting consistency can reduce
   understandability, replicability, generalization and compromise their
   validity. Therefore, an initial set of guidelines is proposed aiming at
   improving SBS report quality. Further evaluation must be accomplished to
   assess the guidelines feasibility when used to report SBS in Software
   Engineering.

AB Muslim consumers are concerned about the status of Islamic religious
   requirements of products and services. The producers' ability to trace
   the beginning to end processes will gain the confidence of the consumers
   that the whole processes from the production, processing and
   distribution of the products are Shariah-compliant. Halal traceability
   provides further information about which Halal standards have been
   applied, allows the consumer to verify the Halal claims and ensures that
   the product delivered to the customer is thoyyib (wholesome, healthy,
   safe, nutritious and of good quality). This paper seeks to develop a
   Halal traceability framework for Halal food producers based on Halal
   traceability deployments in a Halal certified food production company.
   The case study method is employed to learn about the initiatives of the
   company in relation to traceability of Halal food production. Based on
   the experience of the studied case, a framework is generated that Halal
   food producers can refer to as a proper guideline to ensure Halal
   compliance along the production, transportation and distribution system.
   The framework has theoretical interest for replicability to other Halal

AB Purpose - In this paper the authors aim to investigate the importance of
   factors for the adoption of free/libre open source software (FLOSS) in
   the public sector. They seek to evaluate how different factors impact
   during the initiation and implementation phases of the adoption process.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors base the methodological
   approach on two exploratory case studies with a contrasting result
   logic. They build a multi-level framework grounded both on literature
   review, and feedback from stakeholders. They then apply the framework to
   two case studies to better frame the findings. They consider phases of
   adoption (initiation, implementation) and the levels of adoption
   (technological, organizational, environmental, individual).
   Findings - In the case studies, the authors found the importance of a
   strong and decision-centric management board to give the impulse for the
   initiation phase of the process. As perceived by the stakeholders, a
   strong governmental support is of paramount importance to increase the
   adoption at the public level, although in the case studies examined the
   initiation stage started from the impulse of a championing management.
   Both case studies passed the initiation phase successfully. Continuous
   employees' training, organizational objectives consensus, and business
   process reengineering have been found important for the implementation
   phase. In the case study in which these factors were not in place, the
   implementation phase of adoption failed. Environmental factors -
   although relevant for the initiation of the adoption process - are less
   significant during the actual implementation of the adoption process, as
   the contrasting result logic from the case studies shows.
   Research limitations/implications - The study refers to two public
   organizations in a specific environmental setting. No causality among
   factors has been inferred. Quantitative objective data have been used to
   determine the success of adoption, for qualitative data multiple sources
   have been used when possible to limit threats to validity.
   Practical implications - The framework can be used by stakeholders in
   public organizations to better frame their adoption strategies and to
   compare results across institutions. Lessons learnt from the case
   studies can be useful to drive future adoptions of FLOSS.
   Originality/value - The framework combines phases of adoption and levels
   making it possible to frame the analysis of the case studies. It has
   been operationalized with a set of metrics, and with a protocol for the
   case studies to increase replicability value.

AB Associations between trajectories of depressive symptoms and subsequent
   tobacco and alcohol use were examined in two samples of girls assessed
   at age 11.5 (T1), 12.5 (T2), and 13.5 (T3). Two samples were examined to
   ascertain if there was generalizability of processes across risk levels
   and cultures. Study 1 comprised a United States-based sample of 100
   girls in foster care; Study 2 comprised 264 girls in a United Kingdom
   community-based sample. Controlling for T1 aggression and T1 substance
   use, individual variation in intercept and slope of depressive symptoms
   was associated with tobacco use at T3 in both samples: greater intercept
   and increases in depressive symptoms increased the risk for T3 tobacco
   use. A similar pattern of associations was found for alcohol use in
   Study 1. The replicability of findings for the prediction of tobacco use
   from trajectories of depressive symptoms suggests potential benefit in
   identifying girls with elevated depressive symptoms for tobacco use
   prevention programs, prior to the transition to secondary school.

AB Objectives and methods: Earlier research indicates that the ability to
   use everyday technology (ET) may be sensitive to subtle functional
   change. People with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have been identified
   as significantly more disabled in ET use compared to controls, albeit
   less disabled than people with dementia. The aim of this study was to
   investigate the replicability of these findings using an improved
   version of the Everyday Technology Use Questionnaire (ETUQ) to compare
   perceptions of relevance and difficulty in ET use in participants with
   MCI or Alzheimer's disease (AD) and controls. Additional aims were to
   explore the validity of ETUQ, and the relationships between perceived
   difficulty in ET use and cognitive status, mood state, and involvement
   in everyday life activities. In total, 118 participants were included,
   37 with AD, 37 with MCI, and 44 controls.
   Results: Analyses confirmed that the rating scale of the ETUQ functioned
   well. The three groups overlapped but differed significantly in their
   perceptions of ETs relevance (p<0.05) as well as of difficulties in ET
   use (p<0.001). Moderate correlations were also found between ETUQ
   measures and cognitive status, mood, and involvement in activities, the
   strongest being that between ETUQ measures and involvement in activities
   (r=0.563).
   Conclusion: Taken together, the findings underscore the plausibility of
   disability already in people with MCI, as the use of ET strongly
   correlates to involvement in activities. It is therefore important that
   professionals who meet older adults with cognitive impairment take this
   aspect of function into account in assessments and targeted
   interventions.

AB The aim of this study was to analyze the replicability of Zuckerman's
   revised Alternative Five-factor model in a French-speaking context by
   validating the Zuckerman-Kuhlman-Aluja Personality Questionnaire
   (ZKA-PQ) simultaneously in 4 French-speaking countries. The total sample
   was made up of 1,497 subjects from Belgium, Canada, France, and
   Switzerland. The internal consistencies for all countries were generally
   similar to those found for the normative U.S. and Spanish samples. A
   factor analysis confirmed that the normative structure replicated well
   and was stable within this French-speaking context. Moreover, multigroup
   confirmatory factor analyses have shown that the ZKA-PQ reaches scalar
   invariance across these 4 countries. Mean scores were slightly different
   for women and men, with women scoring higher on Neuroticism but lower on
   Sensation Seeking. Globally, mean score differences across countries
   were small. Overall, the ZKA-PQ seems an interesting alternative to
   assess both lower and higher order personality traits for applied or
   research purposes.

AB In the State of Uttarakhand, availability of safe drinking water has
   been a serious problem. In order to tackle the problem, State government
   installed several rural water supply schemes in the past, but efforts
   could not yield desired results due to lack of community participation
   in operation and maintenance of these schemes. Few years back, State
   government with funding support from World Bank installed Rural Water
   Supply and Environmental Sanitation Projects with NGOs and community
   support. The idea was that with the installation of such projects, time
   used in water collection would be considerably saved which a rural
   household can utilise in economic activities to earn additional income.
   The total income, thus, earned would provide an economic advantage when
   such benefits exceeded the costs incurred in these projects. The
   analysis in the paper focused on two issues. (i) The situational
   analysis of various dimensions of drinking water collection in the
   State. (ii) The cost-benefit analysis of a rural water supply scheme.
   The findings revealed that drinking water collection was arduous and a
   time-consuming activity for the rural households in the State. The
   economic benefits which resulted due to time savings from rural water
   supply scheme were higher than the investment made and rural water
   supply schemes of the Uttarakhand State provided a model of
   replicability in other hilly areas of the country.

   variations as well as to improve the replicability of the inspection
   stations. Additionally, a unique statistical experiment was conducted to
   analyze how three factors (namely, operator, defect size, and threshold

AB Methods of research on complex interventions have received increasing
   awareness in nursing and health care science. The British Medical
   Research Council's (MRC) framework on the development and evaluation of
   complex interventions has been widely applied. It does, however, not
   specifically support authors to comprehensively and transparently report
   their complex study to ensure interpretation of study results and
   replicability of the intervention. So far, no reporting criteria for the
   development and evaluation of complex interventions have been published.
   Based on the updated MRC framework and corresponding methodological
   literature, a set of criteria on the reporting and evaluation of complex
   interventions has been developed and reviewed by experts in the field.
   As a result, a criteria list comprising 16 items has been created
   covering the first three stages of the MRC framework: (1) development:
   (2) feasibility and piloting: and (3) introduction of the intervention
   and evaluation. The list provides a minimum standard of criteria
   necessary to ensure high quality reporting of studies on the development
   and evaluation of complex interventions. In a final step, the reporting
   criteria on complex interventions have to pass a formal consensus
   process according to the methods recommended by the EQUATOR network. (C)

AB Experimental ecosystems such as mesocosms have been developed to improve
   the ecological relevance of ecotoxicity test. However, in mesocosm
   studies, the number of replicates is limited by practical and financial
   constraints. In addition, high levels of biological organization are
   characterized by a high variability of descriptive variables. This
   variability and the poor number of replicates have been recognized as a
   major drawback for detecting significant effects of chemicals in
   mesocosm studies. In this context, a tool able to predict precisely
   control mesocosms outputs, to which endpoints in mesocosms exposed to
   chemicals could be compared should constitute a substantial improvement.
   We evaluated here a solution which consists in stochastic modelling of
   the control fish populations to assess the probabilistic distributions
   of population endpoints. An individual-based approach was selected,
   because it generates realistic fish length distributions and accounts
   for both individual and environmental sources of variability. This
   strategy was applied to mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) populations
   monitored in lentic mesocosms. We chose the number of founders as a
   so-called "stressor" because subsequent consequences at the population
   level could be expected. Using this strategy, we were able to detect
   more significant and biologically relevant perturbations than using
   classical methods. We conclude that designing an individual-based model
   is very promising for improving mesocosm data analysis. This methodology
   is currently being applied to ecotoxicological issues.

AB What do we know clinically and empirically about the education of

   question by: (1) reviewing briefly current thinking about psychotherapy
   supervisor training; and (2) examining the available research where
   supervisor training and supervision have been studied. The importance of
   such matters as training format and methods, supervision topics for
   study, supervisor development, and supervisor competencies are
   considered, and some prototypical, competency-based supervisor training
   programs that hold educational promise are identified and described.
   Twenty supervisor training studies are critiqued, and their implications
   for practice and research are examined. Based on this review of training
   programs and research, the following conclusions are drawn: (1) the
   clinical validity of supervisor education appears to be strong, solid,
   and sound, (2) although research suggests that supervisor training can
   have value in stimulating the development of supervisor trainees and
   better preparing them for the supervisory role, any such base of
   empirical support or validity should be regarded as tentative at best;
   and (3) the most formidable challenge for psychotherapy supervisor
   education may well be correcting the imbalance that currently exists
   between clinical and empirical validity and "raising the bar" on the
   rigor, relevance, and replicability of future supervisor training
   research.

AB INTRODUCTION: Through the Global Plan Towards the Elimination of New HIV
   Infections Among Children by 2015 and Keeping their Mothers Alive,
   leaders have called for broader action to strengthen the involvement of
   communities. The Global Plan aspires to reduce new HIV infections among
   children by 90 percent, and to reduce AIDS-related maternal mortality by
   half. This article summarizes the results of a review commissioned by
   UNAIDS to help inform stakeholders on promising practices in community
   engagement to accelerate progress towards these ambitious goals.
   METHODS: This research involved extensive literature review and key
   informant interviews. Community engagement was defined to include
   participation, mobilization and empowerment while excluding activities
   that involve communities solely as service recipients. A promising
   practice was defined as one for which there is documented evidence of
   its effectiveness in achieving intended results and some indication of
   replicability, scale up and/or sustainability.
   RESULTS: Promising practices that increased the supply of preventing
   mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) services included extending
   community cadres, strengthening linkages with community- and faith-based
   organizations and civic participation in programme monitoring. Practices
   to improve demand for PMTCT included community-led social and behaviour
   change communication, peer support and participative approaches to
   generate local solutions. Practices to create an enabling environment
   included community activism and government leadership for greater
   involvement of communities. Committed leadership at all levels,
   facility, community, district and national, is crucial to success.
   Genuine community engagement requires a rights-based, capacity-building
   approach and sustained financial and technical investment. Participative
   formative research is a first step in building community capacity and
   helps to ensure programme relevance. Building on existing structures,
   rather than working in parallel to them, improves programme efficiency,
   effectiveness and sustainability. Monitoring, innovation and information
   sharing are critical to scale up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Ten recommendations on community engagement are offered for
   ending vertical transmission and enhancing the health of mothers and
   families: (1) expand the frontline health workforce, (2) increase
   engagement with community- and faith-based organizations, (3) engage
   communities in programme monitoring and accountability, (4) promote
   community-driven social and behaviour change communication including
   grassroots campaigns and dialogues, (5) expand peer support, (6) empower
   communities to address programme barriers, (7) support community
   activism for political commitment, (8) share tools for community
   engagement, (9) develop better indicators for community involvement and
   (10) conduct cost analyses of various community engagement strategies.
   As programmes expand, care should be taken to support and not to
   undermine work that communities are already doing, but rather to
   actively identify and build on such efforts.

   properties affect marginal fit, what the expected longevity of different

AB Background: This paper has two goals. First, we explore the feasibility
   of conducting online expert panels to facilitate consensus finding among
   a large number of geographically distributed stakeholders. Second, we
   test the replicability of panel findings across four panels of different
   size.
   Method: We engaged 119 panelists in an iterative process to identify
   definitional features of Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI). We
   conducted four parallel online panels of different size through three
   one-week phases by using the RAND's ExpertLens process. In Phase I,
   participants rated potentially definitional CQI features. In Phase II,
   they discussed rating results online, using asynchronous, anonymous
   discussion boards. In Phase III, panelists re-rated Phase I features and
   reported on their experiences as participants.
   Results: 66% of invited experts participated in all three phases. 62% of
   Phase I participants contributed to Phase II discussions and 87% of them
   completed Phase III. Panel disagreement, measured by the mean absolute
   deviation from the median (MAD-M), decreased after group feedback and
   discussion in 36 out of 43 judgments about CQI features. Agreement
   between the four panels after Phase III was fair (four-way kappa =
   0.36); they agreed on the status of five out of eleven CQI features.
   Results of the post-completion survey suggest that participants were
   generally satisfied with the online process. Compared to participants in
   smaller panels, those in larger panels were more likely to agree that
   they had debated each others' view points.
   Conclusion: It is feasible to conduct online expert panels intended to
   facilitate consensus finding among geographically distributed
   participants. The online approach may be practical for engaging large
   and diverse groups of stakeholders around a range of health services
   research topics and can help conduct multiple parallel panels to test
   for the reproducibility of panel conclusions.

AB Because of the relatively recent application of scientific methods to
   the study of persuasion effects-and the consequent replicability of
   those effects-the relationship between governments and students of
   persuasion has changed radically. As is clear from Sara King's (2010)
   article, the U. S. government seeks a beneficial relationship. Not so
   clear is the proper role of the persuasion scientist in that
   relationship. I advocate one such role, that of audience-empowering
   educator. Therein, the goal is not to use persuasion to strengthen the
   desired message artificially but to convince desired audiences to be
   open to processing the message fully.

AB The hybrid populations of peach palm (Bactris gasipaes Kunth) have
   accumulated genetic variability from adjacent landraces, which is
   expected to increase their variability. To test this hypothesis, 176
   plants maintained in the peach palm Germplasm Bank at INPA, including
   four hybrid populations [Belem (n=26); Manaus (n=38); Iquitos, Peru
   (n=41); Yurimaguas, Peru (n=41)], two wild populations (B. gasipaes
   variety chichagui) types 1 (n=21) and 3 (n=7), and two samples of a
   related species, B. riparia, were genotyped with RAPD markers and
   compared to adjacent landraces reported in other studies. Eight RAPD
   primers generated 88 polymorphic and 11 monomorphic markers. The
   replicability test presented a Dice similarity of 0.67, considered
   acceptable. The average heterozygosity of the hybrid populations was
   0.34 and the polymorphism was 87.9%, greater than in the wild
   populations (0.31; 74.7%). The dendrogram of Dice similarities did not
   present groups that clearly correspond to the hybrid populations. The
   gene flow between Iquitos and Yurimaguas (Nm=12.75), and between Iquitos
   and Manaus (Nm=9.47) was high, while between Belem and Manaus it was
   lower than expected (Nm=7.72), probably due to the influence of the
   Solimoes landrace near Manaus. The high value of heterozygosity in
   Manaus seems to be the result of the union of two dispersals after
   domestication: the western Amazonian dispersal, with Iquitos and
   Yurimaguas, and the eastern Amazonian, with Belem, joining in Manaus.
   However, these hybrid populations did not present an accumulation of
   genetic variability expressive enough to differentiate them from the
   landraces.

AB In this methodological commentary, we use Bem's (2011) recent article
   reporting experimental evidence for psi as a case study for discussing
   important deficiencies in modal research practice in empirical
   psychology. We focus on (a) overemphasis on conceptual rather than close
   replication, (b) insufficient attention to verifying the soundness of
   measurement and experimental procedures, and (c) flawed implementation
   of null hypothesis significance testing. We argue that these
   deficiencies contribute to weak method-relevant beliefs that, in
   conjunction with overly strong theory-relevant beliefs, lead to a
   systemic and pernicious bias in the interpretation of data that favors a
   researcher's theory. Ultimately, this interpretation bias increases the
   risk of drawing incorrect conclusions about human psychology. Our
   analysis points to concrete recommendations for improving research
   practice in empirical psychology. We recommend (a) a stronger emphasis
   on close replication, (b) routinely verifying the integrity of
   measurement instruments and experimental procedures, and (c) using
   stronger, more diagnostic forms of null hypothesis testing.

   Objectives: This study aimed to translate, adapting to Brazilian version
   in Portuguese, validate and measure inter and intra-examinator
   reliability and internal consistency of the Thoracic-Lumbar Control
   Scale instrument.
   Setting: State University of Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.
   Methods: This instrument was translated to Brazilian Portuguese by a
   bilingual translator, and it was retranslated to English for conflict
   correction and cultural adaptation. Two physiotherapists were previously
   trained to standardize the scale administration. In all, 22 patients
   were selected and initially assessed through FIM and American Spinal
   Injury Association (ASIA) instruments. Furthermore, they were evaluated
   through the Thoracic-Lumbar Control Scale by two examiners and
   revaluated 1 week after by only one examinator.
   Results: The Brazilian Portuguese version of Thoracic-Lumbar Control
   Scale showed excellent intra and inter-examinator reliability (0.961 and
   0.986), high value of internal consistence (0.934) and significant
   correlation with ASIA sensory score (r = 0.83, P = 0.001).
   Conclusions: The Brazilian Portuguese version of Thoracic-Lumbar Control
   Scale is a valid and efficient instrument to assess trunk control of
   after-spinal cord injury patients, which certifies its replicability by
   other neurology professionals. Spinal Cord (2011) 49, 1198-1202;

AB Discriminant space defining area classes is an important conceptual
   construct for uncertainty characterization in area-class maps.
   Discriminant models were promoted as they can enhance consistency in
   area-class mapping and replicability in error modeling. As area classes
   are rarely completely separable in empirically realized discriminant
   space, where class inseparability becomes more complicated for change
   categorization, we seek to quantify uncertainty in area classes (and
   change classes) due to measurement errors and semantic discrepancy
   separately and hence assess their relative margins objectively.
   Experiments using real datasets were carried out, and a Bayesian method
   was used to obtain change maps. We found that there are large
   differences between uncertainty statistics referring to data classes and
   information classes. Therefore, uncertainty characterization in change
   categorization should be based on discriminant modeling of measurement
   errors and semantic mismatch analysis, enabling quantification of
   uncertainty due to partially random measurement errors, and systematic
   categorical discrepancies, respectively.

AB From the works of Broca and Krogman to modern-day Jantz and Buikstra,
   the orbit has been used for both quantitative and qualitative sex and

   estimations. Orbital height and breadth were measured to determine the
   orbital index and assess differences between men and women or black
   people and white people in the Hamann-Todd Collection. Replicability of
   these measures was also examined. Finally, a geometric morphometric
   study was performed to assess shape differences using the entire margin.
   Significant differences were found in both the index and the
   geomorphometric study; however, further investigation revealed that the
   differences were of little practical use. The measurement differences
   were found to be smaller than intra-observer error, while the geometric
   morphometric analysis demonstrated that minimal percentage of variation
   in shape was attributable to group differences. Thus, these techniques
   should not be used to estimate sex or race.

AB While the use of population-based samples is a common strategy in
   genome-wide association studies (GWASs), family-based samples have
   considerable advantages, such as robustness against population
   stratification and false-positive associations, better quality control,
   and the possibility to check for both linkage and association. In a
   genome-wide linkage study of schizophrenia in Arab-Israeli families with
   multiple affected individuals, we previously reported significant
   evidence for a susceptibility locus at chromosome 6q23.2-q24.1 and
   suggestive evidence at chromosomes 10q22.3-26.3, 2q36.1-37.3 and
   7p21.1-22.3. To identify schizophrenia susceptibility genes, we applied
   a family-based GWAS strategy in an enlarged, ethnically homogeneous,
   Arab-Israeli family sample. We performed genome-wide single nucleotide
   polymorphism (SNP) genotyping and single SNP transmission disequilibrium
   test association analysis and found genome-wide significant association
   (best value of P=1.22x10-(11)) for 8 SNPs within or near highly
   reasonable functional candidate genes for schizophrenia. Of particular
   interest are a group of SNPs within and flanking the transcriptional
   factor LRRFIP1 gene. To determine replicability of the significant
   associations beyond the Arab-Israeli population, we studied the
   association of the significant SNPs in a German case-control validation
   sample and found replication of associations near the UGT1 subfamily and
   EFHD1 genes. Applying an exploratory homozygosity mapping approach as a
   complementary strategy to identify schizophrenia susceptibility genes in
   our Arab Israeli sample, we identified 8 putative disease loci. Overall,
   this GWAS, which emphasizes the important contribution of family based
   studies, identifies promising candidate genes for
   schizophrenia.-Alkelai, A., Lupoli, S., Greenbaum, L., Giegling, I.,

AB Objective: The aim was to study how the measurement error affects the
   repeatability of mismatch negativity (MMN) measurements.
   Methods: Event-related potentials (ERPs) to changes in sound frequency,
   location, intensity, duration, and composition were recorded five times
   during 1-3 weeks from 13 healthy adults using a multi-feature MMN
   paradigm. The accumulation of MMN was modeled empirically with respect
   to measurement error, and repeatability was estimated at 0.6-3.5-mu V
   error levels. The analysis was made for the results in the single
   deviant conditions and their pattern (auditory discrimination profile).
   Results: At the single-subject level, the measurement error
   significantly affected the repeatability until it went below 9-17% of
   MMN peak amplitude. At the group level, the threshold was higher. Peak
   amplitude was generally the most repeatable parameter. Latency was
   superior when the error was moderate or small (<2-3 mu V).
   Conclusions: The measurement error affects the repeatability of MMN. In
   single-subject studies, it should not be neglected if it exceeds 10% of
   the MMN amplitude. The application of the auditory discrimination
   profile is recommended for future applications.
   Significance: The study provided quantitative results to support the
   discussion on improving the repeatability of the MMN measurements. They
   are expected to apply conditionally to other ERP measurements, too. (C)

AB In the void left by the declining popularity of public-private
   partnerships, the concept of 'water operator partnerships' (WOPs) has
   increasingly been promoted as an alternative for improving water
   services provision in developing countries. This paper assesses the
   potential of such partnerships as a 'model' for contributing to the
   MDGs, by focusing on 4 water utilities in Mozambique. Although, the
   study found these partnerships to be successful, it is more sceptical
   about the potential for this type of water operator partnership to
   significantly contribute towards achieving the MDGs. The main reason for
   this is that the replicability of the partnership-model studied in
   Mozambique was found to be quite limited. The case presented in this
   article highlights 3 main lessons for water operator partnerships in the
   water services sector. First, the availability of investment funds is a
   crucial component of a partnership. Without access to such funds the
   impact of such a partnership is likely to be limited. Secondly, the
   level of commitment to the partnership needs to be high if it is to be
   successful. This commitment is likely to take shape in the form of both
   financial commitment as well as commitment of time and effort of the
   organisations involved. Thirdly, even if the partnership is a success,
   the question of how sustainable the achieved performance gains are
   remains a point of concern. All in all, although we acknowledge the
   success achieved by the studied partnership, the findings have made us
   hesitant about the potential for replicating this 'model' at a large
   scale.

AB Regression techniques are versatile in their application to medical
   research because they can measure associations, predict outcomes, and
   control for confounding variable effects. As one such technique,
   logistic regression is an efficient and powerful way to analyze the
   effect of a group of independent variables on a binary outcome by
   quantifying each independent variable's unique contribution. Using
   components of linear regression reflected in the logit scale, logistic
   regression iteratively identifies the strongest linear combination of
   variables with the greatest probability of detecting the observed
   outcome. Important considerations when conducting logistic regression
   include selecting independent variables, ensuring that relevant
   assumptions are met, and choosing an appropriate model building
   strategy. For independent variable selection, one should be guided by
   such factors as accepted theory, previous empirical investigations,
   clinical considerations, and univariate statistical analyses, with
   acknowledgement of potential confounding variables that should be
   accounted for. Basic assumptions that must be met for logistic
   regression include independence of errors, linearity in the logit for
   continuous variables, absence of multicollinearity, and lack of strongly
   influential outliers. Additionally, there should be an adequate number
   of events per independent variable to avoid an overfit model, with
   commonly recommended minimum "rules of thumb" ranging from 10 to 20
   events per covariate. Regarding model building strategies, the three
   general types are direct/standard, sequential/hierarchical, and
   stepwise/statistical, with each having a different emphasis and purpose.
   Before reaching definitive conclusions from the results of any of these
   methods, one should formally quantify the model's internal validity
   (i.e., replicability within the same data set) and external validity
   (i.e., generalizability beyond the current sample). The resulting
   logistic regression model's overall fit to the sample data is assessed
   using various goodness-of-fit measures, with better fit characterized by
   a smaller difference between observed and model-predicted values. Use of
   diagnostic statistics is also recommended to further assess the adequacy
   of the model. Finally, results for independent variables are typically
   reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

AB The author proposes a short-term, intersubjective model for treating
   combat-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Psychodynamic
   approaches to adult-onset PTSD lack the evidence and popularity of other
   approaches because adult-onset traumas are fundamentally distinct from
   the developmental, or childhood-based, traumas that psychoanalysis
   evolved to treat. An approach based in intersubjective systems theory
   can address this problem. The writings of Robert Stolorow (2007) in
   Trauma and Human Existence, which the author first read while deployed
   to Iraq as a psychiatrist, fundamentally changed his understanding of
   trauma and its treatment. The author gives an overview of Stolorow's
   ideas about trauma, and then describes his six-phase short-term
   intersubjective treatment approach. Extensive case material from a
   treatment that occurred in Iraq illustrates each of these phases. The
   author then compares his and Stolorow's views to those of other
   contemporary relational psychoanalytic writers. Future directions
   include the manualization and empirical testing of this approach in
   order to determine its replicability, its utility for therapists who
   lack extensive psychoanalytic training, and its generalizability to
   populations with adult-onset trauma outside the military.

   arch. The stress levels on the radicular thirds of each lower incisors
   were compared and the stress concentration differences on each incisor
   were evaluated. METHODS: Fifteen intrusion utility arches were made up.
   The activation force of 50 gf was measured in the midline. The
   photoelastic model was observed using a circular polariscope in a dark
   field configuration, and, then, photographed. Frontal photographs were
   analyzed, and the fringe order in each region was registered. The method
   replicability was assessed by the Kappa weighted analysis. The
   comparison between the stress levels was carried out using
   Kruskall-Wallis test followed by the Dunn test at p<0.05. RESULTS AND
   CONCLUSIONS: The cervical regions were identified with the highest
   stress levels. By comparing the fringe order among the teeth it could be
   concluded that the highest stress levels are located in the central
   incisors. Therefore the cervical region can be more prone to resorptions
   as well as the central incisors, where higher stresses are concentrated.

   15 arcos base de intrusão e a força de ativação foi mensurada em 50gf na
   região da linha média. O modelo fotoelástico foi observado em
   polariscópio circular, na configuração de campo escuro, e fotografado.
   As fotografias frontais foram analisadas e as ordens de franjas em cada

   repetibilidade do método. A comparação entre as tensões foi realizada
   pelo teste de Kruskal-Wallis complementado com teste de Dunn com nível

   maiores magnitudes de tensões foram observadas nas regiões cervicais. Ao
   se comparar as ordens de franjas entre os dentes, as maiores magnitudes
   de tensões foram observadas nos incisivos centrais. Portanto, a região
   cervical pode estar mais sujeita a reabsorções, assim como os incisivos
   centrais, por concentrarem maiores tensões.

   re-synthesized from either handwritten or automated records.
   Methods. In a recent New Zealand study (ACTRN12608000068369), both
   manual and automated records were acquired from the same anaesthetics.
   Manual records were digitized using digital callipers. Selected data
   (systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure; heart rate; Sp(O2);
   E(CO2)') were replayed in a computerized anaesthetic record-keeping
   system with which the participants were familiar, to present manual and
   corresponding automated anaesthetic records. Ten anaesthetists, randomly
   selected from participants in this study, assessed 24 replayed records
   (a manual and an automated record from each of 10 anaesthetics, with two
   of each displayed twice). They indicated where and how they would have
   intervened if administering these anaesthetics. We compared the number
   of interventions for each pair of anaesthetics and subjective measures
   of anaesthetic quality.
   Results. In our selected sample of unstable anaesthetics, the mean (SD)
   number of interventions per anaesthetic was 4.0 (2.9) vs 5.2 (3.4) for
   manual and automated records, respectively (P=0.013). Subjective
   measures did not differ significantly between record types. Assessors
   identified 32 artifacts in six manual records (0.32/record assessment)
   and 105 artifacts in eight automated records (1.05/record assessment),
   P=0.14. Replicability was moderate (COV 39.8%).
   Conclusions. In comparison with computerized record-keeping, manual
   record-keeping resulted in loss of clinically relevant information.

AB Ramped calibration strips have been suggested as a way for grain
   producers to determine nitrogen needs more accurately. The strips use
   incrementally increasing levels of nitrogen and enable producers to
   conduct an experiment in each field to determine nitrogen needs. This
   study determines whether predictions from the program Ramp Analyzer 1.2
   are replicable in Oklahoma hard red winter wheat (Triticum aestivum).
   Predictions are derived from 36 individual strips from on-farm
   experiments-two pairs of adjacent strips at each of nine winter wheat
   fields in Canadian County, OK. The two pairs of strips within each field
   were between 120 and 155 m apart. Each strip was analyzed three times
   during the 2006-2007 growing season. Nitrogen recommendations from Ramp
   Analyzer 1.2 are not correlated even for strips that were placed side by
   side, and recommendations from strips in the same field show no more
   homogeneity than randomly selected strips throughout the county. The
   results indicate that ramped calibration strips are unlikely to produce
   accurate nitrogen requirement predictions at any spatial scale, whether
   at the county level or for subsections of a single field. In contrast, a
   procedure that uses only measures from the plot with no nitrogen and the
   plot with the highest level of nitrogen applied does show replicability.
   Thus, improvements in the ramped calibration strip technology are needed
   if it is to become viable.

AB Introduction and Objective. The World Food Programme and the Office of
   the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees organized a meeting of
   experts to discuss evaluation of micronutrient interventions under
   special circumstances, such as emergency and refugee situations.
   Results. Multimicronutrient interventions for groups with higher needs
   may include home fortification products for young children or
   supplements for pregnant and lactating women. The choice of preparation
   should be guided by target group needs, evidence of efficacy of a
   product or its compounds, acceptability, and cost-effectiveness.
   Different designs can be used to assess whether an intervention has the
   desired impact. First, program implementation and adherence must be
   ascertained. Then, impact on micronutrient status can be assessed, but
   design options are often limited by logistic challenges, available
   budget, security issues, and ethical and practical issues regarding
   nonintervention or placebo groups. Under these conditions, a
   plausibility design using pre- and post-intervention cross-sectional
   surveys, a prospective cohort study, or a step-wedge design, which
   enrolls groups as they start receiving the intervention, should be
   considered. Post hoc comparison of groups with different adherence
   levels may also be useful. Hemoglobin is often selected as an impact
   indicator because it is easily measured and tends to respond to change
   in micronutrient status, especially iron. However, it is not a very
   specific indicator of micronutrient status, because it is also
   influenced by inflammation, parasitic infestation, physiological status
   (age, pregnancy), altitude, and disorders such as thalassemia and sickle
   cell disease.
   Conclusion. Given the constraints described above, replicability of
   impact in different contexts is key to the validation of micronutrient
   interventions.

AB We study a model of the research process in which the true effect size,
   the replication jitter due to changes in experimental procedure, and the
   statistical error of effect size measurement are all normally
   distributed random variables. Within this model, we analyze the
   probability of successfully replicating an initial experimental result
   by obtaining either a statistically significant result in the same
   direction or any effect in that direction. We analyze both the
   probability of successfully replicating a particular experimental effect
   (i.e., the individual replication probability) and the average
   probability of successful replication across different studies within
   some research context (i.e., the aggregate replication probability), and
   we identify the conditions under which the latter can be approximated
   using the formulas of Killeen (2005a, 2007). We show how both of these
   probabilities depend on parameters of the research context that would
   rarely be known in practice. In addition, we show that the statistical
   uncertainty associated with the size of an initial observed effect would
   often prevent accurate estimation of the desired individual replication
   probability even if these research context parameters were known
   exactly. We conclude that accurate estimates of replication probability
   are generally unattainable.

   originally identified by Block (1971). In analyses of the teacher
   personality assessments of over 2,000 children in 1st through 6th grade
   in 1959-1967 and follow-up data on general and cardiovascular health
   outcomes in over 1,100 adults recontacted 40 years later, we found
   bootstrapped internal replication clustering suggesting that Big Five
   scores were best characterized by a tripartite cluster structure
   corresponding to the ARC types. This cluster structure was fuzzy rather
   than discrete, indicating that ARC constructs are best represented as
   gradients of similarity to 3 prototype Big Five profiles; ARC types and
   degrees of ARC prototypicality showed associations with multiple health
   outcomes 40 years later. ARC constructs were more parsimonious but,
   depending on the outcome, comparable or slightly worse classifiers than
   the dimensional Big Five traits. Forty-year incident cases of heart
   disease could be correctly identified with 67% accuracy by childhood
   personality information alone and stroke incidence with over 70%
   accuracy. Findings support the theoretical validity of ARC constructs,
   their treatment as continua of prototypicality rather than discrete
   categories, and the need for further understanding the robust predictive
   power of childhood personality for midlife health.

AB Molecular methods have become an important tool for studying feeding
   interactions under natural conditions. Despite their growing importance,
   many methodological aspects have not yet been evaluated but need to be
   considered to fully exploit the potential of this approach. Using
   feeding experiments with high alpine carabid beetles and lycosid
   spiders, we investigated how PCR annealing temperature affects prey DNA
   detection success and how post-PCR visualization methods differ in their
   sensitivity. Moreover, the replicability of prey DNA detection among
   individual PCR assays was tested using beetles and spiders that had
   digested their prey for extended times postfeeding. By screening all
   predators for three differently sized prey DNA fragments (range 116-612
   bp), we found that only in the longest PCR product, a marked decrease in
   prey detection success occurred. Lowering maximum annealing temperatures
   by 4 degrees C resulted in significantly increased prey DNA detection
   rates in both predator taxa. Among the three post-PCR visualization
   methods, an eightfold difference in sensitivity was observed. Repeated
   screening of predators increased the total number of samples scoring
   positive, although the proportion of samples testing positive did not
   vary significantly between different PCRs. The present findings
   demonstrate that assay sensitivity, in combination with other
   methodological factors, plays a crucial role to obtain robust trophic
   interaction data. Future work employing molecular prey detection should
   thus consider and minimize the methodologically induced variation that
   would also allow for better cross-study comparisons.

AB In recent years, there has been a growing interest in therapies that
   include the learning of mindfulness skills. The 39-item Five Facet
   Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) has been developed as a reliable and
   valid comprehensive instrument for assessing different aspects of
   mindfulness in community and student samples. In this study, the
   psychometric properties of the Dutch FFMQ were assessed in a sample of
   376 adults with clinically relevant symptoms of depression and anxiety.
   Construct validity was examined with confirmatory factor analyses and by
   relating the FFMQ to measures of psychological symptoms, well-being,
   experiential avoidance, and the personality factors neuroticism and
   openness to experience. In addition, a 24-item short form of the FFMQ
   (FFMQ-SF) was developed and assessed in the same sample and
   cross-validated in an independent sample of patients with fibromyalgia.
   Confirmatory factor analyses showed acceptable model fit for a
   correlated five-factor structure of the FFMQ and good model fit for the
   structure of the FFMQ-SF. The replicability of the five-factor structure
   of the FFMQ-SF was confirmed in the fibromyalgia sample. Both
   instruments proved highly sensitive to change. It is concluded that both
   the FFMQ and the FFMQ-SF are reliable and valid instruments for use in
   adults with clinically relevant symptoms of depression and anxiety.

AB Diverse structural and functional brain alterations have been identified
   in both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, but with variable
   replicability, significant overlap and often in limited number of
   subjects. In this paper, we aimed to clarify differences between bipolar
   disorder and schizophrenia by combining fMRI (collected during an
   auditory oddball task) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data. We
   proposed a fusion method, "multimodal CCA+ joint ICA", which increases
   flexibility in statistical assumptions beyond existing approaches and
   can achieve higher estimation accuracy. The data collected from 164
   participants (62 healthy controls, 54 schizophrenia and 48 bipolar) were
   extracted into "features" (contrast maps for fMRI and fractional
   anisotropy (FA) for DTI) and analyzed in multiple facets to investigate
   the group differences for each pair-wised groups and each modality.
   Specifically, both patient groups shared significant dysfunction in
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and thalamus, as well as reduced white
   matter (WM) integrity in anterior thalamic radiation and uncinate
   fasciculus. Schizophrenia and bipolar subjects were separated by
   functional differences in medial frontal and visual cortex, as well as
   WM tracts associated with occipital and frontal lobes. Both patients and
   controls showed similar spatial distributions in motor and parietal
   regions, but exhibited significant variations in temporal lobe.
   Furthermore, there were different group trends for age effects on
   loading parameters in motor cortex and multiple WM regions, suggesting
   that brain dysfunction and WM disruptions occurred in identified regions
   for both disorders. Most importantly, we can visualize an underlying
   function structure network by evaluating the joint components with
   strong links between DTI and fMRI. Our findings suggest that although
   the two patient groups showed several distinct brain patterns from each
   other and healthy controls, they also shared common abnormalities in
   prefrontal thalamic WM integrity and in frontal brain mechanisms. (c)

AB Pandemic H1N1/2009 influenza virus, derived from a reassortment of
   avian, human, and swine influenza viruses, possesses a unique gene
   segment combination that had not been detected previously in animal and
   human populations. Whether such a gene combination could result in the
   pathogenicity and transmission as H1N1/2009 virus remains unclear. In
   the present study, we used reverse genetics to construct a reassortant
   virus (rH1N1) with the same gene combination as H1N1/2009 virus (NA and
   M genes from a Eurasian avian-like H1N1 swine virus and another six
   genes from a North American triple-reassortant H1N2 swine virus).
   Characterization of rH1N1 in mice showed that this virus had higher
   replicability and pathogenicity than those of the seasonal human H1N1
   and Eurasian avian-like swine H1N1 viruses, but was similar to the
   H1N1/2009 and triple-reassortant H1N2 viruses. Experiments performed on
   guinea pigs showed that rH1N1 was not transmissible, whereas pandemic
   H1N1/2009 displayed efficient transmissibility. To further determine
   which gene segment played a key role in transmissibility, we constructed
   a series of reassortants derived from rH1N1 and H1N1/2009 viruses.
   Direct contact transmission studies demonstrated that the HA and NS
   genes contributed to the transmission of H1N1/2009 virus. Second, the HA
   gene of H1N1/2009 virus, when combined with the H1N1/2009 NA gene,
   conferred efficient contact transmission among guinea pigs. The present
   results reveal that not only gene segment reassortment but also amino
   acid mutation were needed for the generation of the pandemic influenza
   virus.

AB To obtain approval for the use vertebrate animals in research, an
   investigator must assure an ethics committee that the proposed number of
   animals is the minimum necessary to achieve a scientific goal. How does
   an investigator make that assurance? A power analysis is most accurate
   when the outcome is known before the study, which it rarely is. A 'pilot
   study' is appropriate only when the number of animals used is a tiny
   fraction of the numbers that will be invested in the main study because
   the data for the pilot animals cannot legitimately be used again in the
   main study without increasing the rate of type I errors (false
   discovery). Traditional significance testing requires the investigator
   to determine the final sample size before any data are collected and
   then to delay analysis of any of the data until all of the data are
   final. An investigator often learns at that point either that the sample
   size was larger than necessary or too small to achieve significance.
   Subjects cannot be added at this point in the study without increasing
   type I errors. In addition, journal reviewers may require more
   replications in quantitative studies than are truly necessary.
   Sequential stopping rules used with traditional significance tests allow
   incremental accumulation of data on a biomedical research problem so
   that significance, replicability, and use of a minimal number of animals
   can be assured without increasing type I errors.

AB The replicability of an oncolytic virus is measured by its burst size.
   The burst size is the number of new viruses coming out from a lysis of
   an infected tumor cell. Some clinical evidences show that the burst size
   of an oncolytic virus is a defining parameter for the success of
   virotherapy. This article analyzes a basic mathematical model that
   includes burst size for oncolytic virotherapy. The analysis of the model
   shows that there are two threshold values of the burst size: below the
   first threshold, the tumor always grows to its maximum (carrying
   capacity) size; while passing this threshold, there is a locally stable
   positive equilibrium solution appearing through transcritical
   bifurcation; while at or above the second threshold, there exits one or
   three families of periodic solutions arising from Hopf bifurcations. The
   study suggests that the tumor load can drop to a undetectable level

   was repeated to investigate the replicability and reliability of both

   and general condition according to MDHAQ were similar in both groups in
   terms of changes between first and second day of the study, there was no
   significant differences between the groups. But while responses in the
   younger group according to these 3 parameters were highly reliable, the
   elderly group's responses were reliable only for their last week pain
   assessment. Both tests were replicable in the elderly group, VAS and

   while fatigue, general health condition and DI indicated diminished
   reliability in the elderly group, compared to the young group. (C) 2010

AB P>1. Mesocosms are used extensively by ecologists to gain a mechanistic
   understanding of ecosystems based on the often untested assumption that
   these systems can replicate the key attributes of natural assemblages.
   2. Previous investigations of stream mesocosm utility have explored
   community composition, but here for the first time, we extend the
   approach to consider the replicability and realism of food webs in four
   outdoor channels (4 m2).
   3. The four food webs were similarly complex, consisting of diverse
   assemblages (61-71 taxa) with dense feeding interactions (directed
   connectance 0 center dot 09-0 center dot 11). Mesocosm food web
   structural attributes were within the range reported for 82
   well-characterized food webs from natural streams and rivers. When
   compared with 112 additional food webs from standing freshwater, marine,
   estuarine and terrestrial environments, stream food webs (including
   mesocosms) had similar characteristic path lengths, but typically lower
   mean food chain length and exponents for the species-link relationship.
   4. Body size (M) abundance (N) allometric scaling coefficients for
   trivariate taxonomic mesocosm food webs (-0 center dot 53 to -0 center
   dot 49) and individual size distributions (-0 center dot 60 to -0 center
   dot 58) were consistent and similar to those from natural systems,
   suggesting that patterns of energy flux between mesocosm consumers and
   resources were realistic approximations.
   5. These results suggest that stream mesocosms of this scale can support
   replicate food webs with a degree of biocomplexity that is comparable to
   'natural' streams. The findings highlight the potential value of
   mesocosms as model systems for performing experimental manipulations to

AB Background: Poverty is widely recognized as a major determinant of poor
   health, and this link has been extensively studied and verified. Despite
   the strong evidentiary link, little work has been done to determine what
   primary care health providers can do to address their patients' income
   as a risk to their health. This qualitative study explores the barriers
   to primary care responsiveness to poverty as a health issue in a
   well-resourced jurisdiction with near-universal health care insurance
   coverage.
   Methods: One to one interviews were conducted with twelve experts on
   poverty and health in primary care in Ontario, Canada. Participants
   included family physicians, specialist physicians, nurse practitioners,
   community workers, advocates, policy experts and researchers. The
   interviews were analysed for anticipated and emergent themes.
   Results: This study reveals provider-and patient-centred structural,
   attitudinal, and knowledge-based barriers to addressing poverty as a
   risk to health. While many of its findings reinforce previous work in
   this area, this study's findings point to a number of areas front line
   primary care providers could target to address their patients' poverty.
   These include a lack of provider understanding of the lived reality of
   poverty, leading to a failure to collect adequate data about patients'
   social circumstances, and to the development of inappropriate care
   plans. Participants also pointed to prejudicial attitudes among
   providers, a failure of primary care disciplines to incorporate
   approaches to poverty as a standard of care, and a lack of knowledge of
   concrete steps providers can take to address patients' poverty.
   Conclusions: While this study reinforces, in a well-resourced
   jurisdiction such as Ontario, the previously reported existence of
   significant barriers to addressing income as a health issue within
   primary care, the findings point to the possibility of front line
   primary care providers taking direct steps to address the health risks
   posed by poverty. The consistent direction and replicability of these
   findings point to a refocusing of the research agenda toward an
   examination of interventions to decrease the health impacts of poverty.

AB Background
   Recent studies have raised issues concerning the replicability of gene x
   environment (G x E) interactions involving the monoamine oxidase A
   (MAOA) gene in moderating the associations between abuse or maltreatment
   exposure and antisocial behaviour. This study attempted to replicate the
   findings in this area using a 30-year longitudinal study that has strong
   resemblance to the original research cohort.
   Aims
   To test the hypothesis that the presence of the low-activity MAOA
   genotype was associated with an increased response to abuse exposure.
   Method
   Participants were 398 males from the Christchurch Health and Development
   Study who had complete data on: MAOA promoter region variable number
   tandem repeat genotype; antisocial behaviour to age 30; and exposure to
   childhood sexual and physical abuse.
   Results
   Regression models were fitted to five antisocial behaviour outcomes
   (self-reported property offending; self-reported violent offending;
   convictions for property/violent offending; conduct problems; hostility)
   observed from age 16 to 30, using measures of childhood exposure to
   sexual and physical abuse. The analyses revealed consistent evidence of
   G x E interactions, with those having the low-activity MAOA variant and
   who were exposed to abuse in childhood being significantly more likely
   to report later offending, conduct problems and hostility. These
   interactions remained statistically significant after control for a
   range of potentially confounding factors. Findings for convictions data
   were somewhat weaker.
   Conclusions
   The present findings add to the evidence suggesting that there is a
   stable G x E interaction involving MAOA, abuse exposure and antisocial
   behaviour across the life course.

AB In previous studies event-related potentials and oscillations in
   response to subject's own name have been analyzed extensively on
   group-level in healthy subjects and in patients with a disorder of
   consciousness. Subject's own name as a deviant produces a P3. With
   equiprobable stimuli, non-phase-locked alpha oscillations are smaller in
   response to subject's own name compared to other names or subject's own
   name backwards. However, little is known about replicability on a
   single-subject level.
   Seventeen healthy subjects were assessed in an own-name paradigm with
   equiprobable stimuli of subject's own name, another name, and subject's
   own name backwards. Event-related potentials and non-phase locked
   oscillations were analyzed with single-subject, non-parametric
   statistics.
   No consistent results were found either for ERPs or for the non-phase
   locked changes of oscillatory activities. Only 4 subjects showed a
   robust effect as expected, that is, a lower activity in the alpha-beta
   range to subject's own name compared to other conditions. Four subjects
   elicited a higher activity for subject's own name.
   Thus, analyzing the EEG reactivity in the own-name paradigm with
   equiprobable stimuli on a single-subject level yields a high variance
   between subjects. In future research, single-subject statistics should
   be applied for examining the validity of physiologic measurements in
   other paradigms and for examining the pattern of reactivity in patients.

AB Automated repetitive PCR (rep-PCR; DiversiLab) was compared to PCR
   ribotyping of the 16S-23S RNA intergenic spacer of Clostridium difficile
   (CD) as the "gold standard" method for CD typing. PCR products were
   separated on DiversiLab LabChips (bioMerieux, St. Laurent, Quebec,
   Canada) utilizing a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara,
   CA) operating the DiversiLab v1.4 assay. Bioanalyzer data were exported
   to a secure DiversiLab website and analyzed with DiversiLab v3.4
   software. Replicability of each method was verified by confirming that
   the 5 CD reference strains (RS) formed distinct clusters (CD4, CD6,
   VL0047, VL0013 [ribotype 027], VL0018 [ribotype 001]) by both typing
   methods. Ninety randomly selected clinical isolates (CS) were analyzed
   by both methods: 49 from community-acquired and 41 from
   hospital-acquired cases. A similarity index (SI) of >= 90% was used to
   define clusters when comparing the known RS cluster to the PCR
   ribotyping and rep-PCR patterns of CS. Fourteen different PCR-ribotype
   clusters were identified, but most CS formed 4 major clusters (i.e., CD4
   [15/90; 17%], CD6 [17%], 027 [12%], and 001 [9%]). A total of 7 rep-PCR
   types were identified, but most CS formed 2 major rep-PCR clusters
   (i.e., CD4 [29/90; 32%] and CD6 [23%]); several PCR ribotypes occurred
   within a single rep-PCR cluster. Rep-PCR did not distinguish 027 or 001
   isolates; i) 027 RS strain did not cluster, ii) eleven 027 CS strains
   clustered as CD4, iii) no 027 CS strains clustered with the 027 RS, and
   iv) only 2 001 CS clustered with the RS. Agreement between the
   PCR-ribotype and rep-PCR clusters only occurred for 35/90 (39%) of the
   CS using a rep-PCR SI of >= 90%. Rep-PCR time to results was similar,
   but the annual costs of routinely using this method are 32% higher than
   PCR ribotyping. Routine use of rep-PCR for CD typing is limited by its
   lack of definitive separation of the hypertoxigenic 027 or 001 outbreak
   CD strains. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Aim A pilot scheme was developed to integrate the distribution of
   ready-made near spectacles into primary eye-care delivery in six primary
   healthcare facilities in Zanzibar, East Africa. With the aim of scaling
   it up to national level, the scheme was evaluated in terms of relevance,
   effectiveness, equality, sustainability and replicability.
   Methods Six medical officers were trained in ocular anatomy, history
   taking, blindness definitions, ocular abnormalities, preventable
   blindness, distance visual acuity, near visual acuity, eye examination,
   record keeping and referral criteria. Each clinic was supplied with 200
   near spectacles. The evaluation team revisited the units 6 months later
   to assess the scheme.
   Results The evaluation team recommendations included: a structured
   approach to planning from the outset, facility selection criteria,
   raising awareness through community meetings, funding through a
   revolving fund and the introduction of referral monitoring systems. 372
   of the 574 patients attending the facilities had eye complaints; 285 eye
   infections, 29 distance vision problems and 173 near vision problems.
   173 near vision spectacles were dispensed, and 74 people were referred.
   All medical officers and participants recommended continuing with the
   scheme.
   Conclusions The project is highly relevant and timely, given that
   presbyopia is now a priority with the WHO. The scheme could easily be
   adopted at the national level in Zanzibar and other areas in East
   Africa.

AB Epilepsy is one of the most prevalent neurological disorders, afflicting
   approximately 50 million Indians. Owing to affordability and easy
   availability, use of first-generation antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is
   heavily encouraged for the treatment of epilepsy in resource-limited
   countries such as India. Although first-generation AEDs are at par with
   second-generation AEDs in terms of efficacy, adverse drug reactions
   (ADRs) are quite common with them. This could be attributed to the
   inferior pharmacokinetic parameters such as nonlinear metabolism, narrow
   therapeutic index and formation of toxic intermediates. In addition,
   epilepsy patients may differ in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
   profiles, with about 1/3(rd) of the population failing to respond to
   treatment. A proportion of this interindividual variability in response
   may be explained by genetic heterogeneity in the activity and expression
   of the network of proteins such as metabolizing enzymes, transporters
   and targets of AEDs. Over the last two decades, a considerable effort
   has been made by the scientific community for unraveling this genetic
   basis of variable response to AEDs. However, there have been
   inconsistencies in such genetic association studies conducted across
   different territories of the world. There could be several reasons
   underlying the poor replicability of these studies, mainly nonuniform
   phenotypic definitions, poor sample size and interethnic variability. In
   the present review article, we provide an overview of heterogeneity in
   study designs for conducting pharmacogenetic studies. In addition,
   critical recommendations required for overcoming such challenges imposed
   by pharmacogenetic epidemiological studies have been briefly discussed.

AB Pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) is
   the most common and least satisfactory of the PDD diagnoses. It is not
   formally operationalized, which limits its reliability and has hampered
   attempts to assess its validity. We aimed, first, to improve the
   reliability and replicability of PDD-NOS by operationalizing its
   DSM-IV-TR description and, second, to test its validity through
   comparison with autistic disorder (AD) and Asperger's disorder (AsD). In
   a sample of 256 young people (mean age = 9.1 years) we used
   Developmental, Diagnostic and Dimensional (3Di) algorithmic analysis to
   classify DSM-IV-TR AD (n = 97), AsD (n = 93) and PDD-NOS (n = 66).
   Groups were compared on independent measures of core PDD symptomatology,
   associated autistic features, and intelligence. Contrary to the
   assumption that PDD-NOS is heterogeneous, almost all (97%) of those with
   PDD-NOS had one distinct symptom pattern, namely impairments in social
   reciprocity and communication, without significant repetitive and
   stereotyped behaviors (RSB). Compared to AD and AsD, they had comparably
   severe but more circumscribed social communication difficulties, with
   fewer non-social features of autism, such as sensory, feeding and
   visuo-spatial problems. These individuals appear to have a distinct
   variant of autism that does not merely sit at the less severe end of the
   same continuum of symptoms. The current draft guidelines for DSM-V,
   which mandate the presence of RSBs for any PDD diagnosis, would exclude
   such people from the autistic spectrum. Autism Res 2011, 4: 121-131. (C)

AB When creating a basic biological profile, determining the sex of
   subadult skeletal remains is always problematic and several methods for
   sex determination have been proposed over time. The lateral angle of the
   internal auditory canal has been described as a good sex predictor in
   adults, and here we test its reliability for sex determination of
   subadults. The reliability of this method was, assessed on a sample of
   47 Portuguese known sex and age skeletons representing individuals from
   birth to 15 years of age. The lateral angle was measured on-screen using
   the Adobe Photoshop CS2 (R) software, from photographs of bissected
   lateral angle casts. The measurements were performed by three different
   researchers in order to evaluate intra- and inter-observer variation.
   Our results demonstrate reasonable repeatability and replicability of
   the on-screen measurements. We used a 45 degrees sectioning point to
   allocate individuals in the sample according to sex and attained 62.9%
   accuracy in sex determination using the lateral angle. When broken down
   by age, the least accuracy was observed for the 6-15 years-old group
   (54.5%) and the greatest accuracy was achieved for the 2 -5 years-old
   (75.0%), but still low overall. The use of a sample-specific sectioning
   point did not improve the results. Although sexual dimorphism is
   statistically significant between female and male subadults, the lateral
   angle failed to consistently discriminate individuals according to sex.

AB Implicit measures have contributed to important insights in almost every

   concerning their use, one of which is their considerable variation in
   reliability, with many implicit measures having questionable
   reliability. The goal of the present investigation was to examine an
   overlooked consequence of this liability with respect to replication,
   when such implicit measures are used as dependent variables in
   experimental studies. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, the authors
   demonstrate that a higher level of unreliability in such dependent
   variables is associated with substantially lower levels of
   replicability. The results imply that this overlooked consequence can
   have far-reaching repercussions for the development of a cumulative
   science. The authors recommend the routine assessment and reporting of
   the reliability of implicit measures and also urge the improvement of
   implicit measures with low reliability.

AB Background: Polyploidy is important from a phylogenetic perspective
   because of its immense past impact on evolution and its potential future
   impact on diversification, survival and adaptation, especially in
   plants. Molecular population genetics studies of polyploid organisms
   have been difficult because of problems in sequencing multiple-copy
   nuclear genes using Sanger sequencing. This paper describes a method for
   sequencing a barcoded mixture of targeted gene regions using
   next-generation sequencing methods to overcome these problems.
   Results: Using 64 3-bp barcodes, we successfully sequenced three
   chloroplast and two nuclear gene regions (each of which contained two
   gene copies with up to two alleles per individual) in a total of 60
   individuals across 11 species of Australian Poa grasses. This method had
   high replicability, a low sequencing error rate (after appropriate
   quality control) and a low rate of missing data. Eighty-eight percent of
   the 320 gene/individual combinations produced sequence reads, and >80%
   of individuals produced sufficient reads to detect all four possible
   nuclear alleles of the homeologous nuclear loci with 95% probability.
   We applied this method to a group of sympatric Australian alpine Poa
   species, which we discovered to share an allopolyploid ancestor with a
   group of American Poa species. All markers revealed extensive allele
   sharing among the Australian species and so we recommend that the
   current taxonomy be re-examined. We also detected hypermutation in the
   trnH-psbA marker, suggesting it should not be used as a land plant
   barcode region. Some markers indicated differentiation between Tasmanian
   and mainland samples. Significant positive spatial genetic structure was
   detected at <100 km with chloroplast but not nuclear markers, which may
   be a result of restricted seed flow and long-distance pollen flow in
   this wind-pollinated group.
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that 454 sequencing of barcoded
   amplicon mixtures can be used to reliably sample all alleles of
   homeologous loci in polyploid species and successfully investigate
   phylogenetic relationships among species, as well as to investigate
   phylogeographic hypotheses. This next-generation sequencing method is
   more affordable than and at least as reliable as bacterial cloning. It
   could be applied to any experiment involving sequencing of amplicon
   mixtures.

AB This two-article sequence on rubber-assisted embossing was aimed to
   understand the basic mechanisms affecting the pattern uniformity and
   replicability and to determine a process window for achieving uniform
   patterning and faithful replication. In Part I, the effects of major
   process and material parameters were identified and studied, and
   strategies for successful hot embossing with rubber as a pressure medium
   were proposed. In Part II, the rubber-assisted embossing process was
   analyzed considering the unique rheological behavior of the materials
   involved to develop useful predictive capabilities for this new process.
   Specifically, a finite-strain hyperelastic formulation was used for
   simulating the isothermal embossing stage, and a generalized Maxwell
   model was used to study the stress relaxation during the holding stage
   and to predict the elastic recovery after demolding. The rheological
   properties obtained in Part I were fitted to the constitutive models and
   implemented in the simulation procedures. The simulation results agreed
   with the major findings in the experimental work and provided a more
   quantitative insight into the process. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 51:601-608,

AB Background: The importance of behaviour change in improving health is
   illustrated by the increasing investment by funding bodies in the
   development and evaluation of complex interventions to change
   population, patient, and practitioner behaviours. The development of
   effective interventions is hampered by the absence of a nomenclature to
   specify and report their content. This limits the possibility of
   replicating effective interventions, synthesising evidence, and
   understanding the causal mechanisms underlying behaviour change. In
   contrast, biomedical interventions are precisely specified (e.g., the
   pharmacological 'ingredients' of prescribed drugs, their dose and
   frequency of administration). For most complex interventions, the
   precise 'ingredients' are unknown; descriptions (e.g., 'behavioural
   counseling') can mean different things to different researchers or
   implementers. The lack of a method for specifying complex interventions
   undermines the precision of evidence syntheses of effectiveness, posing
   a problem for secondary, as well as primary, research.
   We aim to develop a reliable method of specifying intervention
   components ('techniques') aimed at changing behaviour.
   Methods/Design: The research will be conducted in three phases. The
   first phase will develop the nomenclature. We will refine a preliminary
   list of techniques and definitions. Using a formal consensus method,
   experts will then define the key attributes of each technique and how it
   relates to, and differs from, others. They will evaluate the techniques
   and their definitions until they achieve an agreed-upon list of clearly
   defined, nonredundant techniques. The second phase will test the
   nomenclature. Trained experts (primary researchers and systematic
   reviewers), equipped with a coding manual and guidance, will use the
   nomenclature to code published descriptions of complex interventions.
   Reliability between experts, over time, and across types of users will
   be assessed. We will assess whether using the nomenclature to write
   intervention descriptions enhances the clarity and replicability of
   interventions. The third phase will develop a web-based users' resource
   of clearly specified and nonredundant techniques, which will aid the
   scientific understanding of, and development of, effective complex
   interventions. Dissemination throughout the project will be through
   stakeholder meetings, targeted multidisciplinary workshops, conference
   presentation, journal publication, and publication in an interactive
   web-based platform (a Wiki).
   Discussion: The development of a reliable method of specifying
   intervention components aimed at changing behaviour will strengthen the
   scientific basis for developing, evaluating, and reporting complex
   interventions. It will improve the precision of evidence syntheses of
   effectiveness, thus enhancing secondary, as well as primary, research.

AB The purpose of this study is to provide a detailed analysis of the
   methodological quality of experimental and quasi-experimental group
   designed studies in the area of stuttering intervention. A total of 23
   randomized controlled trials (RCT) and quasi-experimental studies of
   treatment in the area of stuttering were identified and retrieved from
   an electronic search of nine databases and 13 individual journals. Using
   the Downs and Black Checklist each study was coded for reporting,
   external validity, internal validity, and internal validity confounding.
   Results of the coding indicated that while overall reporting was
   reasonably complete, the quality of the external and internal validity
   scores was found to be substantively incomplete. This lack of clarity
   and completeness of reporting issues related to the external and
   internal validity makes the interpretation of the findings of individual
   study results problematic and seriously effects the replicability of the
   individual study. Implications of these findings are suggested for both
   researchers and clinicians.

AB Background: Sexual violence is a worldwide problem affecting children
   and adults. Knowledge of trends in prevalence is essential to inform the
   design and evaluation of preventive and intervention programmes. We
   aimed to assess the prevalence of lifetime sexual violence for both
   sexes and to document the prevalence of adult and child abuse by birth
   year in the general population. Methods: National cluster-randomized
   telephone interview study of 3120 adults in Ireland was done. Results:
   Child sexual abuse involving physical contact was reported by 20% of
   women and 16% of men. In adulthood, figures were 20% and 10% for women
   and men, respectively. Prevalence of any form of sexual violence across
   the lifespan was 42% (women) and 38% (men). Analysis by year of birth
   indicated a curvilinear pattern for child sexual abuse with lower
   prevalence in the oldest and youngest participants. Sexual violence in
   young adulthood showed a linear pattern with higher prevalence in the
   youngest participants. Conclusion: The trend of lower rates of
   experience of child sexual abuse in younger adults in the sample is in
   keeping with findings from other countries. The trend of higher rates of
   adult sexual violence in younger adults is worrying, particularly since
   the same participants reported less experience of child sexual abuse
   than the preceding generations. There is a paucity of international data
   addressing the issue of cohort differences in exposure to sexual
   violence. Within-study analysis, and follow-up studies designed to
   maximize replicability, are needed to inform discussion about societal
   trends in different types of sexual violence.

AB Natural isolates of Tobacco mild green mosaic virus (TMGMV) fail to
   infect tomato because the tomato tm-1 protein binds to the replication
   proteins of TMGMV and prevents RNA replication. Previously, we isolated
   a TMGMV mutant that overcomes tm-1-mediated resistance and multiplies in
   tomato plants. Here, we show that the causal mutations in the
   replication protein gene that abolish the interaction with tm-1 reduce
   its ability to suppress RNA silencing in host plant Nicotiana
   benthamiana. The results suggest that the multifunctionality of the
   replication proteins is an evolutionary constraint of tobamoviruses that
   restricts their host ranges.

AB Background
   Recent meta-analyses have raised concerns about the replicability of
   gene x environment interactions involving the serotonin transporter gene
   (5-HTTLPR) in moderating the associations between adverse life events
   and mental disorders.
   Aims
   To use data gathered over the course of a 30-year longitudinal study of
   a New Zealand birth cohort to test the hypothesis that the presence of
   short ('s') alleles of 5-HTTLPR are associated with an increased
   response to life stress.
   Method
   Participants were 893 individuals from the Christchurch Health and
   Development Study who had complete data on: the 5-HTTLPR genotype;
   psychiatric disorders up to the age of 30; and exposure to childhood and
   adult adverse life events.
   Results
   A series of 104 regression models were fitted to four mental health
   outcomes (depressive symptoms, major depression, anxiety disorder and
   suicidal ideation) observed at ages 18, 21, 25 and 30 using 13 measures
   of life-course stress that spanned childhood and adult stressors. Both
   multiplicative and additive models were fitted to the data. No evidence
   was found that would support the hypothesis that alleles of 5-HTTLPR are
   associated with increased responsivity to life stressors.
   Conclusions
   The present findings add to the evidence suggesting that it is unlikely
   that there is a stable gene x environment interaction involving
   5-HTTLPR, life stress and mental disorders.

AB Objective: The speech-evoked auditory brainstem response (ABR) provides
   an objective measure of subcortical encoding of complex acoustic
   features. However, the intrasubject reliability of this response in both
   optimal and challenging listening conditions has not yet been
   systematically documented. This study aimed to evaluate test-retest
   reliability of the speech-evoked ABR in young adults.
   Methods: In each of two sessions, ABRs were obtained with: (1) a 170 ms
   /da/ syllable presented in quiet as well as 2-talker and 6-talker babble
   background noise conditions and (2) a 40 ms /da/ syllable presented in
   quiet. Test-retest reliability of the responses was analyzed in the
   frequency and time domains. Results: The speech-evoked ABR does not vary
   significantly across sessions within individuals on measures of temporal
   encoding (i.e., peak latencies, stimulus-to-response and
   response-to-response measures), frequency representation and response
   magnitude.
   Conclusions: The subcortical auditory pathway produces a response to a
   complex sound that is stable and replicable from session to session.
   Significance: By demonstrating the high degree of replicability in
   optimal and challenging listening conditions, the applicability of the
   speech-evoked ABR may be increased to examining a range of auditory
   processing abilities in clinical and research settings. (C) 2010

AB Background: Searching for associations between genetic variants and
   complex diseases has been a very active area of research for over two
   decades. More than 51,000 potential associations have been studied and
   published, a figure that keeps increasing, especially with the recent
   explosion of array-based Genome-Wide Association Studies. Even if the
   number of true associations described so far is high, many of the
   putative risk variants detected so far have failed to be consistently
   replicated and are widely considered false positives. Here, we focus on
   the worldwide patterns of replicability of published association
   studies.
   Results: We report three main findings. First, contrary to previous
   results, genes associated to complex diseases present lower degrees of
   genetic differentiation among human populations than average genome-wide
   levels. Second, also contrary to previous results, the differences in
   replicability of disease associated-loci between Europeans and East
   Asians are highly correlated with genetic differentiation between these
   populations. Finally, highly replicated genes present increased levels
   of high-frequency derived alleles in European and Asian populations when
   compared to African populations.
   Conclusions: Our findings highlight the heterogeneous nature of the
   genetic etiology of complex disease, confirm the importance of the
   recent evolutionary history of our species in current patterns of
   disease susceptibility and could cast doubts on the status as false
   positives of some associations that have failed to replicate across
   populations.

   segment combination that had not been detected previously in animal and
   human populations. Whether such a gene combination could result in the
   pathogenicity and transmission as H1N1/2009 virus remains unclear. In
   the present study, we used reverse genetics to construct a reassortant
   virus (rH1N1) with the same gene combination as H1N1/2009 virus (NA and
   M genes from a Eurasian avian-like H1N1 swine virus and another six
   genes from a North American triple-reassortant H1N2 swine virus).
   Characterization of rH1N1 in mice showed that this virus had higher
   replicability and pathogenicity than those of the seasonal human H1N1
   and Eurasian avian-like swine H1N1 viruses, but was similar to the
   H1N1/2009 and triple-reassortant H1N2 viruses. Experiments performed on
   guinea pigs showed that rH1N1 was not transmissible, whereas pandemic
   H1N1/2009 displayed efficient transmissibility. To further determine
   which gene segment played a key role in transmissibility, we constructed
   a series of reassortants derived from rH1N1 and H1N1/2009 viruses.
   Direct contact transmission studies demonstrated that the HA and NS
   genes contributed to the transmission of H1N1/2009 virus. Second, the HA
   gene of H1N1/2009 virus, when combined with the H1N1/2009 NA gene,
   conferred efficient contact transmission among guinea pigs. The present
   results reveal that not only gene segment reassortment but also amino
   acid mutation were needed for the generation of the pandemic influenza
   virus.

AB Molecular methods have become an important tool for studying feeding
   interactions under natural conditions. Despite their growing importance,
   many methodological aspects have not yet been evaluated but need to be
   considered to fully exploit the potential of this approach. Using
   feeding experiments with high alpine carabid beetles and lycosid
   spiders, we investigated how PCR annealing temperature affects prey DNA
   detection success and how post-PCR visualization methods differ in their
   sensitivity. Moreover, the replicability of prey DNA detection among
   individual PCR assays was tested using beetles and spiders that had
   digested their prey for extended times postfeeding. By screening all
   predators for three differently sized prey DNA fragments (range 116-612
   bp), we found that only in the longest PCR product, a marked decrease in
   prey detection success occurred. Lowering maximum annealing temperatures
   by 4 A°C resulted in significantly increased prey DNA detection rates in
   both predator taxa. Among the three post-PCR visualization methods, an
   eightfold difference in sensitivity was observed. Repeated screening of
   predators increased the total number of samples scoring positive,
   although the proportion of samples testing positive did not vary
   significantly between different PCRs. The present findings demonstrate
   that assay sensitivity, in combination with other methodological
   factors, plays a crucial role to obtain robust trophic interaction data.
   Future work employing molecular prey detection should thus consider and
   minimize the methodologically induced variation that would also allow
   for better cross-study comparisons.

AB Objective: To establish a colorimetric method to determine the
   antioxidant capacity of water-soluble compounds in functional food based
   on the reaction between 1,10-2 phenanthroline and Fe~(3+) to form yellow
   complexes.Methods: The hydrophilic antioxidants in functional foods were
   extracted with pH 7.4 PBS buffer solution(75 mmol/L) and allowed to
   reduce Fe~(3+) to Fe~(2+).Fe~(2+) was exposed to 1,10-2 phenanthroline
   to form a stable Fe~(2+)-phenanthroline complex.The absorbance of the
   complex was determined on a spectrophotometer at 536 nm and used to
   calculate the antioxidant capacity of water-soluble compounds in
   functional food using Trolox,a water soluble vitamin E analog,as the
   reference standard.The accuracy,linearity,repeatability,recovery rate
   and limit of detection(LOD) of this method were studied,and its
   feasibility was also verified.Results: This method showed a good
   linearity over the Trolox concentration of 0.66-10.53 mumol/L(R2 =
   0.9999).The LOD was 0.54 mumol/L.The replicability and repeatability was
   2.7% and 3.3% relative standard deviation(RSD),respectively.The mean
   spike recovery was(99.94.6)%(n = 5).Conclusion: This method is
   applicable to determine the antioxidant capacity of water-soluble
   compounds in functional food.

AB Epilepsy is one of the most prevalent neurological disorders, afflicting
   approximately 50 million Indians. Owing to affordability and easy
   availability, use of first-generation antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is
   heavily encouraged for the treatment of epilepsy in resource-limited
   countries such as India. Although first-generation AEDs are at par with
   second-generation AEDs in terms of efficacy, adverse drug reactions
   (ADRs) are quite common with them. This could be attributed to the
   inferior pharmacokinetic parameters such as nonlinear metabolism, narrow
   therapeutic index and formation of toxic intermediates. In addition,
   epilepsy patients may differ in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
   profiles, with about 1/3rd of the population failing to respond to
   treatment. A proportion of this interindividual variability in response
   may be explained by genetic heterogeneity in the activity and expression
   of the network of proteins such as metabolizing enzymes, transporters
   and targets of AEDs. Over the last two decades, a considerable effort
   has been made by the scientific community for unraveling this genetic
   basis of variable response to AEDs. However, there have been
   inconsistencies in such genetic association studies conducted across
   different territories of the world. There could be several reasons
   underlying the poor replicability of these studies, mainly nonuniform
   phenotypic definitions, poor sample size and interethnic variability. In
   the present review article, we provide an overview of heterogeneity in
   study designs for conducting pharmacogenetic studies. In addition,
   critical recommendations required for overcoming such challenges imposed
   by pharmacogenetic epidemiological studies have been briefly discussed.

AB The treatment of brain diseases is complicated by the presence of the
   blood-brain barrier. This barrier limits the crossing of therapeutic
   molecules from the blood vessels into the brain. Today, direct
   intracerebral infusion applying convection-enhanced delivery (CED) is
   proposed to circumvent this problem and enhance the area of distribution
   of infusate beyond the parameters of diffusion. Several factors affect
   the efficacy, predictability and replicability of CED, such as the
   catheter model, infusion rate and site of infusion. We set out to
   investigate if probabilistic tractography can be used to model the
   infusion flow and predict the intracerebral movement of molecules. In
   this study we describe a modeling and analysis framework based upon
   probabilistic tractography. This framework was used to compare
   probabilistic tractography modeling and actual CED infusion measurements
   in the putamen of non-human primates, as this gray matter structure is
   proposed as a target for CED treatment of Parkinson's disease.

AB Buildings worldwide account for nearly 40% of global energy consumption.
   The biggest energy consumer in buildings is the Heating, Ventilation and
   Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. HVAC also ranks top in terms of number
   of complaints by tenants. Maintaining HVAC systems in good conditions
   through early fault detection is thus a critical issue. The problem,
   however, is difficult since HVAC systems are large in scale, consisting
   of many coupling subsystems, building and equipment dependent, and
   operating under uncertain conditions. In this paper, a model-based and
   data-driven method is presented for robust system-level fault detection
   with potential for large-scale implementation. It is a synergistic
   integration of (1) Statistical Process Control (SPC) for measuring and
   analyzing variations; (2) Kalman filtering based on gray-box models to
   provide predictions and determine SPC control limits; and (3) system
   analysis for analyzing fault propagation. The method has been tested
   against a simulation model of a 420-meter-high building. It detects both
   sudden faults and gradual degradation, and differentiates faults within
   a subsystem or propagated from elsewhere. Furthermore, the method is
   simple and generic, and should have good replicability and scalability.

   naturally expressed by any and those of one of its Spanish counterparts,
   specifically cualquier(a) so as to identify possible cross-linguistic
   transfer; ii) to illustrate a high-performing methodological procedure.
   A set of tools, among them an ad hoc tertium comparationis consisting of
   a set of cross-linguistic labels, a parallel corpus (P-ACTRES) and a
   reference corpus (CREA) are used to explore: i) the uses of any in
   context and the resulting translation environments served by cualquiera;
   ii) the degree of matching between translated cualquier(a) and its
   non-translated usage in standard European Spanish. The corpus-based
   procedure follows basically Krzeszowski's contrastive model (1990) with
   the addition of a 'target language fit' stage (Chesterman, 2004). The
   analysis shows different behaviour in translated and non-translated
   Spanish: Cualquier(a) is underused as a translation option for
   'existential' any and acquires a new function, 'negative', which is not
   a possibility in non-translated language for the same contexts. The
   analysis also corroborates the usefulness and the replicability of the
   methodological procedure.

AB Every year, globally, an estimated 66 500 women die attempting to
   terminate a pregnancy. To the extent that women's lives and futures are
   influenced by childbirth, access to contraception and safe abortion
   services is fundamental to gender equity. Yet many countries legally
   restrict access to safe abortion. In these countries, women with a
   socioeconomic advantage are more able to circumvent restrictive abortion
   laws and access safe abortion services; poor and less educated women are
   more likely to use unsafe methods and suffer serious morbidity and
   death. This is particularly egregious as deaths from unsafe abortion are
   entirely preventable, given access to modern contraception and safe
   abortion services. Bangladesh's Menstrual Regulation (MR) Programme is
   an example of a programme with the potential to reduce morbidity and
   mortality related to unsafe abortion in the context of a restrictive
   abortion law. We describe how Bangladesh's MR Programme evolved from an
   urban-based relief effort in 1972 to a nationwide primary care-level
   programme; review intersectoral processes that have and continue to
   influence policy development and programme implementation; assess the
   impact of the programme; explore contextual factors that have influenced
   the potential of the programme over time; and comment on issues of
   programme sustainability and replicability in settings beyond
   Bangladesh. Available evidence suggests that the MR Programme has
   contributed to a reduction in maternal mortality; however, mortality
   from unsafe abortion continues to disproportionately impact the
   socioeconomically disadvantaged.

   in identity commitment and career success perceptions between casually
   and permanently employed nurses. Specifically, it aims to investigate
   whether casually employed nurses have lower levels of commitment to
   their professional identity, as compared to permanently employed nurses,
   and whether this in turn negatively affects their perceptions of career
   success.
   Design/methodology/approach - Role identity theory was used to predict
   the career success perceptions of casually employed (n = 181) versus
   permanently employed (n = 476) nurses. Data were collected via a
   self-report questionnaire.
   Findings - The data revealed that casual nurses had lower levels of
   identity commitment and more negative career success perceptions.
   Affective commitment fully mediated the relationship between employment
   status and subjective career success.
   Research limitations/implications - Future studies should test the
   replicability of these findings with longitudinal data.
   Originality/value - This paper provides novel insights to the temporary
   employment and careers literatures. Given the previously uncharted
   territory of understanding the role of identity in the career success
   perceptions of different categories of workers, it opens avenues for
   future research, while also answering theoretical questions about the
   identity and career consequences of temporary employment.

   investigation of standalone research in social and environmental areas;
   through a corporate social responsibility perspective; to the beginnings
   of the convergence of perspectives of sustainability as the triple
   bottom line and the emergence of SSCM as a theoretical framework. While
   the SSCM research has become more theoretically rich and
   methodologically rigorous, there are numerous opportunities for further
   advancing theory, methodology, and the managerial relevance of future
   inquiries.
   Research limitations/implications - The trends and gaps identified
   through our analysis allow us to develop a cogent agenda to guide future
   SSCM research.
   Practical implications - The current perspectives of SSCM hold important
   implications for managers, by directing limited resources toward
   projects which intersect environmental and/or social performance, and
   economic performance.

AB Background - Polyploidy is important from a phylogenetic perspective
   because of its immense past impact on evolution and its potential future
   impact on diversification, survival and adaptation, especially in
   plants. Molecular population genetics studies of polyploid organisms
   have been difficult because of problems in sequencing multiple-copy
   nuclear genes using Sanger sequencing. This paper describes a method for
   sequencing a barcoded mixture of targeted gene regions using
   next-generation sequencing methods to overcome these problems. Results -
   Using 64 3-bp barcodes, we successfully sequenced three chloroplast and
   two nuclear gene regions (each of which contained two gene copies with
   up to two alleles per individual) in a total of 60 individuals across 11
   species of Australian  Poa grasses. This method had high replicability,
   a low sequencing error rate (after appropriate quality control) and a
   low rate of missing data. Eighty-eight percent of the 320
   gene/individual combinations produced sequence reads, and >80% of
   individuals produced sufficient reads to detect all four possible
   nuclear alleles of the homeologous nuclear loci with 95% probability. We
   applied this method to a group of sympatric Australian alpine  Poa
   species, which we discovered to share an allopolyploid ancestor with a
   group of American  Poa species. All markers revealed extensive allele
   sharing among the Australian species and so we recommend that the
   current taxonomy be re-examined. We also detected hypermutation in the 
   trnH- psbA marker, suggesting it should not be used as a land plant
   barcode region. Some markers indicated differentiation between Tasmanian
   and mainland samples. Significant positive spatial genetic structure was
   detected at <100 km with chloroplast but not nuclear markers, which may
   be a result of restricted seed flow and long-distance pollen flow in
   this wind-pollinated group. Conclusions - Our results demonstrate that
   454 sequencing of barcoded amplicon mixtures can be used to reliably
   sample all alleles of homeologous loci in polyploid species and
   successfully investigate phylogenetic relationships among species, as
   well as to investigate phylogeographic hypotheses. This next-generation
   sequencing method is more affordable than and at least as reliable as
   bacterial cloning. It could be applied to any experiment involving
   sequencing of amplicon mixtures.

AB Background: "The purpose of the present study was to explore further the
   cross-cultural validity, consistency, and replicability of FAIDSS among
   students when assessing HIV/AIDS-related stigma and fear of people
   living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in Lagos metropolis.
   Methods: Using a purposive method, participants in Lagos Metropolis were
   surveyed using a questionnaire and conceptualization derived from the
   work of Ross and Hunter (1992) to measure a variety of HIV-related
   attitudinal and behavioural items. Quantitative data analyzed employing
   factor analysis using maximum-likelihood extraction followed by oblique
   rotation (direct oblimin, delta=0).
   Results: On the factor scale measuring having fear of sex with a
   particular person, younger respondents especially females significantly
   more likely to report greater fear than for any other groups. Our
   findings further suggest that levels of fear of outsiders are high among
   males and need urgent action and intervention at both individual and
   societal levels.
   Conclusion: It is argued that messages and interventions must be
   targeted to promote a positive social environment for those living with
   or affected by HIV/AIDS, and to be useful in understanding stigma, fear
   and prejudice more fully and in reducing them. A crosscurrent behavioral
   change that can transform AIDS from an inevitably fatal pandemic to a
   chronic and manageable disease is the answer.

AB Studies on the determination of trichlorobenzenes (TCBs) and
   2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP) in wastewater of machining have been
   carried out. A gas chromatography/mass spectrometry with selected-ion
   monitoring acquisition method (GC/MS/SIM) was built up followed by the
   dispersive liquid liquid microextraction (DLLME) of the target analytes
   from the matrices. Comparing with some traditional methods, the present
   method was accurate and easier to be operated, with broader linear
   range, better enrichment property, replicability, and less interference.
   Overall recoveries were 92.5~104.3 % with RSD values at 2.3~8.7%. The
   detective limit was 2.0, 6.0, 3.0 and 5.0 mug/L for 1,3,5-, 1,2,4-,
   1,2,3-TCB and 2,4,6-TCP, respectively. Parameters and some important
   factors, which may affect the recoveries and replicabilities for the
   determination of targent analytes, have been investigated. The present
   method has been applied for the determination of the TCBs and 2,4,6-TCP
   residues of 10 real samples. The results showed that 4 of them were
   found to contain TCBs and/or 2,4,6-TCP with concentration at 0.12~1.26

AB Background: AphasiaBank is a computerised database of interviews between
   persons with aphasia (PWAs) and clinicians. By February 2011 the
   database had grown to include 145 PWAs and 126 controls from 12 sites
   across the United States. The data and related analysis programs are
   available free over the web.
   Aims: The overall goal of AphasiaBank is the construction of a system
   for accumulating and sharing data on language usage by PWAs. To achieve
   this goal we have developed a standard elicitation protocol, and
   systematic automatic and manual methods for transcription, coding, and
   analysis.
   Methods & Procedures: We present sample analyses of transcripts from the
   retelling of the Cinderella story. These analyses illustrate the
   application of our methods for the study of phonological, lexical,
   semantic, morphological, syntactic, temporal, prosodic, gestural, and
   discourse features.
   Outcomes & Results: AphasiaBank will allow researchers access to a
   large, shared database that can facilitate hypothesis testing and
   increase methodological replicability, precision, and transparency.
   Conclusions: AphasiaBank will provide researchers with an important new
   tool in the study of aphasia.

AB BACKGROUND: Musical performance demands high-leveled coordination,
   concentration, motor- and memory-skills, making it particularly
   susceptible to anxiety states. Researches in this field have advanced
   significantly with the development of specific instruments to evaluate
   music performance anxiety, such as the Kenny Music Performance Anxiety
   Inventory (K-MPAI). OBJECTIVES: The present study has the objective of
   translating, adapting and validating the K-MPAI to the Portuguese
   language. METHODS: After the written consent given by the author of the
   original K-MPAI scale, the K-MPAI scale was translated and validated for
   Portuguese idiom. The Portuguese-version of K-MPAI was then applied to
   218 amateur and professional musicians of both genders. For the
   concurrent validation, the validated Portuguese-version of the State
   Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used. RESULTS: Analysis of the
   internal consistency demonstrated a Cronbach's alpha = 0.957, with p <
   0.001, replicated with p = 0.378 and the concurrent validation with the
   State Trait Anxiety Inventory, demonstrated a Cronbach's alpha = 0.642
   and p < 0.001. DISCUSSION: The study allows evaluating data samples with
   high levels of reliability and replicability, which translates this
   study based on an unbiased sample and replicable to other populations.
   The concurrent validation between K-MPAI and IDATE, allows inferring
   that the scales are comparable in their capability of measuring anxiety
   levels in musicians. 
Y4 CONTEXTO: A performance musical requer alto nível de habilidade em
   diversos parâmetros, como coordenação motora, atenção e memória, o que a
   torna particularmente suscetível aos estados de ansiedade. Pesquisas
   nessa área têm avançado com a introdução de instrumentos específicos
   para abordar a ansiedade na performance musical, como é o caso da Kenny
   Music Performance Anxiety Inventory (K-MPAI). OBJETIVOS: O presente
   estudo teve como objetivo traduzir, adaptar e validar a K-MPAI para a
   língua portuguesa. MÉTODOS: Após autorização da autora, a escala K-MPAI
   foi traduzida e validada. A escala em língua portuguesa foi aplicada a
   218 músicos de ambos os sexos, amadores e profissionais. Para a
   validação concorrente, foi utilizado o Inventário de Ansiedade
   Traço-Estado (IDATE), versão validada na língua portuguesa da State
   Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). RESULTADOS: A análise da consistência
   interna apresentou alfa de Cronbach = 0,957 com p < 0,001,
   reprodutibilidade com p = 0,378 e validação concorrente com a IDATE com
   alfa de Cronbach = 0,642 e p < 0,001. CONCLUSÃO: O estudo permite
   considerar a amostra com graus de confiabilidade e reprodutibilidade
   elevados, o que traduz este estudo como provindo de uma amostra não
   tendenciada e replicável a outras populações. A validação concorrente
   entre a K-MPAI e a IDATE permite inferir que ambas as escalas são
   comparáveis na capacidade de medir os níveis de ansiedade em musicistas.

AB This study aims to examine discourse trends about traditions in Korean
   design. Further, this study examines books containing the views of each
   researcher, articles reported in design magazines, and academic essays
   announced at conferences. The conclusions of this study are as follows.
   Firstly, most design researchers merely assert the appropriateness of
   the modernization of traditional aesthetics; as a result, they have not
   developed design knowledge into a practical stage. Secondly, they have
   not connected the results of traditional aesthetics with design-related
   knowledge such as design philosophy, design methodology, and modeling
   principles. Thirdly, designers' practical usage of the traditions has a
   tendency to repeat the visual appearances of traditions. Finally, since
   around 2000, the discourse on Korean traditions has faded away and the
   discourse on Asian aesthetics has become active. The characteristics of
   these researches show that design researchers had the intention of
   studying traditions, but the results of their researches indicate a lack
   of concreteness and thus are unable to be applied to the fields of
   design practice. In other words, Korean design does not establish Korean
   design principles, design elements, and aesthetics with the requisite
   replicability, universality, and science which would enable them to be
   applied to educational sites and industrial sites of design. The aim of
   this study is to suggest a fundamentally alternative perspective of
   creative resources in the modern design atmosphere by using the
   aesthetics and formativeness of Korean traditional objects.

   단행본이나 비평, 디자인 전문지의 기획과 기사, 학회를 중심으로 한 학술 논문을 고찰하면서 그 특성을 분석하였다. 연구결과에
   의하면 한국 디자인에서 전통에 대한 연구의 흐름과 특성은 다음과 같다. 첫째, 많은 디자인 연구자들이 전통적 미학의 현대화라는
   당위성을 주장하고는 있지만 거대 담론의 단계에 머무르면서 구체적 실천의 단계를 위한 이론을 제공하지 못하고 있다. 둘째, 그간
   예술계와 미학, 철학자들의 연구 결과를 디자인 인식, 디자인 철학, 조형원리 등과 연관시켜 활용하지 못하고 있다. 셋째, 전통에
   대한 디자이너의 활용 방법은 시각적 표피의 재현 위주로 진행되고 있다. 넷째, 2000년대 들어 한국의 전통 논의가 사라지고
   아시아 미학으로 확대되어 논의되고 있다. 이러한 연구 성향의 특성은 전통에 대한 당위적 연구 의지는 있으나, 디자인 실천 영역에서
   활용할 수 있는 구체성을 결여하고 있다고 요약할 수 있다. 다시 말해서 디자인 교육 현장이나 산업 현장에서 사용할 수 있는
   반복가능하며 보편적인 한국적 조형원리나 조형요소, 미학의 정립이 미약하다는 현실을 보여준다는 것이다. 본 연구의 궁극적인 목표는
   한국 전통문화물에 드러난 미학과 조형성을 현대의 디자인 환경에서 창조적인 자원으로 활용할 수 있는 과학적 이론의 정립을 위한
   기초적인 전망을 제시하는데 있다.

AB Reading ability and specific reading disability (SRD) are complex traits
   involving several cognitive processes and are shaped by a complex
   interplay of genetic and environmental forces. Linkage studies of these
   traits have identified several susceptibility loci. Association studies
   have gone further in detecting candidate genes that might underlie these
   signals. These results have been obtained in samples of mainly European
   ancestry, which vary in their languages, inclusion criteria, and
   phenotype assessments. Such phenotypic heterogeneity across samples
   makes understanding the relationship between reading (dis)ability and
   reading-related processes and the genetic factors difficult; in
   addition, it may negatively influence attempts at replication. In moving
   forward, the identification of preferable phenotypes for future sample
   collection may improve the replicability of findings. This review of all
   published linkage and association results from the past 15 years was
   conducted to determine if certain phenotypes produce more replicable and
   consistent results than others.

AB Background: Poverty is widely recognized as a major determinant of poor
   health, and this link has been extensively studied and verified. Despite
   the strong evidentiary link, little work has been done to determine what
   primary care health providers can do to address their patients' income
   as a risk to their health. This qualitative study explores the barriers
   to primary care responsiveness to poverty as a health issue in a
   well-resourced jurisdiction with near-universal health care insurance
   coverage. Methods: One to one interviews were conducted with twelve
   experts on poverty and health in primary care in Ontario, Canada.
   Participants included family physicians, specialist physicians, nurse
   practitioners, community workers, advocates, policy experts and
   researchers. The interviews were analysed for anticipated and emergent
   themes. Results: This study reveals provider- and patient-centred
   structural, attitudinal, and knowledge-based barriers to addressing
   poverty as a risk to health. While many of its findings reinforce
   previous work in this area, this study's findings point to a number of
   areas front line primary care providers could target to address their
   patients' poverty. These include a lack of provider understanding of the
   lived reality of poverty, leading to a failure to collect adequate data
   about patients' social circumstances, and to the development of
   inappropriate care plans. Participants also pointed to prejudicial
   attitudes among providers, a failure of primary care disciplines to
   incorporate approaches to poverty as a standard of care, and a lack of
   knowledge of concrete steps providers can take to address patients'
   poverty. Conclusions: While this study reinforces, in a well-resourced
   jurisdiction such as Ontario, the previously reported existence of
   significant barriers to addressing income as a health issue within
   primary care, the findings point to the possibility of front line
   primary care providers taking direct steps to address the health risks
   posed by poverty. The consistent direction and replicability of these
   findings point to a refocusing of the research agenda toward an
   examination of interventions to decrease the health impacts of poverty.

AB Expanding mental models in order for future conditions to be interpreted
   and shaped more efficiently is a constant strategic challenge for
   social, economic, political, and institutional agents. Accordingly, this
   article discusses the concepts related to future studies and their
   historical trajectory by presenting the various classifications and
   approaches found in the literature characterizing their relations and
   theoretical gaps. Therefore, using the principles of the dialectical
   method, a descriptive theoretical study was conducted using literature
   review as the research method. This study presents a characterization of
   the concepts found in the studies investigated that are considered
   benchmark creating a timeline. Through a comparative analysis of the
   terms found, the focus was developing a conceptual framework suitable
   for the Brazilian scientific scenario concerning future studies. It was
   concluded that this is not a recent topic, and the existing
   concepts/classifications have received several contributions updating
   and expanding its specifications and operational complexities, since the
   1950's. The originally generic approach has been replaced with more
   specific visions related to individual methods of investigation and
   future building achieving greater relevance, consistency, and
   replicability. The adoption of a certain classification (and its
   methods) must result from a historical and cultural identity with the
   context of application. It is believed that this research contributes to
   avoiding and or clearing theoretical misunderstandings, conceptual
   errors, or broad and indiscriminate use of synonymous concepts, which
   are sometimes found in the literature, presenting opportunities for
   future studies technical development. 
Y4 Expandir modelos mentais, de tal modo que as condições futuras possam

   discutir os conceitos relativos aos estudos do futuro, bem como a
   trajetória histórica do tema, apresentando as diversas nomenclaturas e
   abordagens encontradas até então na literatura, caracterizando suas
   relações e lacunas teóricas. Para tanto, utilizando-se dos princípios do
   método dialético, procedeu-se um estudo teórico de finalidade
   descritiva, que adotou como procedimento de pesquisa a consulta
   bibliográfica. O estudo apresenta uma caracterização de conceitos a
   partir de trabalhos e autores considerados referências no tema,
   constituindo uma cronologia temática. Por meio de uma análise
   comparativa dos termos encontrados, busca-se contribuir com a construção
   de um arcabouço conceitual adequado à aplicação no cenário científico
   brasileiro acerca de estudos do futuro. Conclui-se que o tema tem
   origens remotas e as conceituações/nomenclaturas existentes receberam
   diversas contribuições, atualizando-se e ampliando suas especificações e
   complexidades operacionais, encontrando espaço crescente no meio
   científico a partir da década de 1950. A abordagem originalmente
   genérica tem sido substituída por visões mais específicas, relacionadas
   a métodos próprios de investigação e construção do futuro, ganhando
   maior pertinência, coerência e replicabilidade. A adoção de uma ou outra
   nomenclatura (e seus métodos) deve decorrer de uma identidade histórica
   e cultural com o contexto de aplicação. Acredita-se que essa pesquisa
   aponta um caminho oposto às confusões teóricas, erros conceituais ou uso
   amplo e indiscriminado de conceitos sinônimos, por vezes verificados na
   literatura, indicando ainda algumas oportunidades de desenvolvimento
   técnico sobre os estudos do futuro.

AB This review presents an analysis of the literature on behavioral effects
   of developmental exposure to nicotine, as assessed in rodent models that
   mimic the consequences for human offspring of maternal cigarette
   smoking. Despite the frequency of reports of low birth weight,
   hyperactivity, cognitive deficits, and psychiatric problems,
   inconsistencies exist in both the clinical and experimental literature.
   Confounding socioeconomic and other demographic variables may account
   for discrepancies in clinical reports, and the choice of developmental
   exposure period and the method of nicotine administration may explain
   differences in experimental outcomes. Analysis of a number of variables
   (e.g., physical, behavioral, and cognitive) shows that fetal exposure to
   nicotine does not consistently cause growth retardation or decreased
   birth weight, nor reliably affect motor activity. But combined pre- and
   neonatal exposure is likely to result in delayed reflex development,
   global impairments in learning and memory, and an increased incidence of
   symptoms that model psychiatric illness. There is also support for
   increased self-administration of nicotine and other drugs of abuse in
   animals exposed developmentally to nicotine, as well as potent effects
   on offspring responses to drug challenges. Unlike reports in the
   clinical literature, sexually dimorphic effects were not evident in most
   animal models. Possible neuroanatomical and cholinergic mechanisms
   responsible for behavioral changes are briefly discussed. Statistical
   and design considerations are provided to increase the translational
   value of this research and, most importantly, enhance the replicability
   of reported findings.

   Alzheimer's disease is effective. Biomarkers might offer the potential
   of a quantifiable objective measure of treatment effectiveness. This
   paper suggests several criteria by which biomarkers might be evaluated
   as outcomes measures. These include biological plausibility, statistical
   significance, dose dependence, convergence across measures, and
   replicability. If biomarkers can meet these criteria, then, pending
   regulatory approval, they may have a role in the evaluation of treatment
   effectiveness in Alzheimer's disease. If not, their usefulness may be in
   supplementing, but not supplanting, clinical profiles of treatment
   effects.

AB The promotion of research is one of the main components of the World
   Health Organizations Stop TB Strategy, which includes 'programme-based
   operational research (OR)' and 'research on introducing new tools into
   practice'. The importance of OR in improving tuberculosis (TB) control
   was recognised a long time ago, and historical OR studies have been
   instrumental in the development of major strategies for TB control.
   Although a growing number of OR projects are being conducted in the
   world today, little is known about their results or their likely impact
   on TB control programmes. As funding organisations increasingly
   recognise the need for OR, we propose a rational framework to conduct
   OR, which covers a spectrum from local setting-oriented to international
   policy guiding research, and determines the relevance, replicability and
   generalisability of the results. OR in TB control is aimed at 1)
   improving programme performance; 2) assessing the feasibility,
   effectiveness and impact of new strategies or interventions on TB
   control; and 3) collecting evidence to guide policy recommendations on
   specific interventions. This requires strengthened capacity to plan and
   conduct OR in low-income countries and appropriate support to conduct
   both nationally and internationally led OR projects. Suggestions are
   made for potential steps for improved purpose-driven OR, which may help
   to improve TB control locally and inform policy recommendations
   internationally.

AB BACKGROUND: Numerous genome-wide scans conducted by genotyping
   previously ascertained single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have
   provided candidate signatures for positive selection in various regions
   of the human genome, including in genes involved in pigmentation traits.
   However, it is unclear how well the signatures discovered by such
   haplotype-based test statistics can be reproduced in tests based on full
   resequencing data. Four genes (oculocutaneous albinism II (OCA2),
   tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1), dopachrome tautomerase (DCT), and
   KIT ligand (KITLG)) implicated in human skin-color variation, have shown
   evidence for positive selection in Europeans and East Asians in previous
   SNP-scan data. In the current study, we resequenced 4.7 to 6.7 kb of DNA
   from each of these genes in Africans, Europeans, East Asians, and South
   Asians.
   RESULTS: Applying all commonly used neutrality-test statistics for
   allele frequency distribution to the newly generated sequence data
   provided conflicting results regarding evidence for positive selection.
   Previous haplotype-based findings could not be clearly confirmed.
   Although some tests were marginally significant for some populations and
   genes, none of them were significant after multiple-testing correction.
   Combined P values for each gene-population pair did not improve these
   results. Application of Approximate Bayesian Computation Markov chain
   Monte Carlo based to these sequence data using a simple forward
   simulator revealed broad posterior distributions of the selective
   parameters for all four genes, providing no support for positive
   selection. However, when we applied this approach to published sequence
   data on SLC45A2, another human pigmentation candidate gene, we could
   readily confirm evidence for positive selection, as previously detected
   with sequence-based and some haplotype-based tests.
   CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our data indicate that even genes that are strong
   biological candidates for positive selection and show reproducible
   signatures of positive selection in SNP scans do not always show the
   same replicability of selection signals in other tests, which should be
   considered in future studies on detecting positive selection in genetic
   data.

AB The mixotrophic marine ciliate Mesodinium rubrum possesses a highly
   modified algal endosymbiont as a nutrition source for the species.
   Accordingly, we assumed that the species can reflect the ecotoxicity on
   marine producer (as phytoplankton) and consumer (as zooplankton) both. A
   series of experiments were conducted to identify the potential of the
   species as a standard test species for marine ecotoxicological study. 
   The comparison of species sensitivity on reference toxic materials was
   made using potassium dichromate for phytoplankton and copper chloride
   for zooplankton. The ciliate revealed the highest sensitivity on both
   reference materials among the seven test species including
   phytoplankton, benthic copepod and rotifer species. The toxicity end
   point of the species was 72hr-EC_(50)=1.52 mg/L (as potassium
   dichromate) estimated by population growth inhibition (PGI), which is
   more sensitive than the most sensitive phytoplankton Skeletonema
   costatum (72hr-EC_(50)=3.05 mg/L). As comparison to rotifer, it also
   revealed higher sensitivity on copper chloride; 72hr-EC_(50)=0.38 mg/L
   for ciliate and 48hr-EC_(50)=0.48 mg/L for rotifer. Also, the elutriate
   toxicity test of various ocean disposal wastes were conducted to
   identify the potential of ciliate toxicity test application using
   industrial waste sludges. The toxicity of leather processing waste
   sludge was highest on the ciliate, followed by dyeing waste sludge and
   dye production waste sludge as an increasing order of toxicity.
   72h-EC_(50) of ciliate PGI test was 1.83% and that of S. costatum 3.84%
   for leather waste sludge which showed highest toxicity. The toxicity
   test results also revealed that the highest sensitivity was observed on
   ciliate species on ocean disposed sludge wastes. Also, ciliate toxicity
   test well discriminated the degree of toxicity between sludge sources;
   72h-EC_(50) values were 1.83% for leather processing waste sludge,
   16.75% for dye production waste sludge and 27.75% for textile production
   waste sludge. Even the laboratory culture methods of the species were
   not generally established yet, the species has high potential as the
   standard test species for marine toxicity test in terms of the dual
   reflection of phyto- and zooplankton toxicity from single test,
   sensitivity and test replicability.

AB In previous research, a deliberative process for integrating stakeholder
   perspectives in the ranking of risks was introduced and empirically
   tested with lay groups composed predominantly of Americans. In this
   paper, we explore the viability of this process with lay groups of
   Chinese, because previous research has shown that Americans and Chinese
   differ substantially along many dimensions of cognition and social
   organization relevant to decision-making. Using 10 environmental hazards
   based on current Chinese environmental regulatory programs as the risk
   domain, five groups of 8-9 participants ranked hazards using both
   holistic and multi-attribute approaches. Results show that (1) risk
   rankings from the holistic and multi-attribute approaches are
   consistent, (2) participants indicate that they are satisfied with the
   procedures and resulting rankings, and (3) agreement between
   participants increases over the course of the ranking exercise. Results
   for Chinese participants were compared with previously reported results
   for Americans to look for cultural effects involving deference to
   technical expertise and quantitative analysis, and skepticism toward
   public participation in policy-making. Although there were some hints of
   cultural differences, neither difference significantly affected measures
   of the method's validity or replicability. Because this process offers a
   scientifically sound and measured approach to stakeholder involvement in
   risk management, it may be attractive to Chinese leaders as they respond
   to growing demand for public participation in the policy-making process.
   Whether Chinese citizens would consider the process described here to be
   satisfactory in a real policy context remains to be tested.

AB Much of the current understanding about the pathogenesis of altered
   mood, impaired concentration and neurovegetative symptoms in major
   depression has come from animal models. However, because of the unique
   and complex features of human depression, the generation of valid and
   insightful depression models has been less straightforward than modeling
   other disabling diseases like cancer or autoimmune conditions. Today's
   popular depression models creatively merge ethologically valid
   behavioral assays with the latest technological advances in molecular
   biology and automated video-tracking. This chapter reviews depression
   assays involving acute stress (e.g., forced swim test), models
   consisting of prolonged physical or social stress (e.g., social defeat),
   models of secondary depression, genetic models, and experiments designed
   to elucidate the mechanisms of antidepressant action. These paradigms
   are critically evaluated in relation to their ease, validity and
   replicability, the molecular insights that they have provided, and their
   capacity to offer the next generation of therapeutics for depression.

AB Understanding how genetic variants impact the regulation and expression
   of genes is important for forging mechanistic links between variants and

   statistical interactions among variants that alter gene expression and
   identify 79 genes showing highly significant interaction effects
   consistent with genetic heterogeneity. Of the 79 genes, 28 have been
   linked to phenotypes through previous genomic studies. We characterize
   the structural and statistical nature of these 79 cis-epistasis models,
   and show that interacting regulatory SNPs often lie far apart from each
   other and can be quite distant from the gene they regulate. By using
   cis-epistasis models that account for more variance in gene expression,
   investigators may improve the power and replicability of their genomics
   studies, and more accurately estimate an individual's gene expression
   level, improving phenotype prediction.

AB Background: Current reporting of intervention content in published
   research articles and protocols is generally poor, with great diversity
   of terminology, resulting in low replicability. This study aimed to
   extend the scope and improve the reliability of a 26-item taxonomy of
   behaviour change techniques developed by Abraham and Michie [Abraham, C.
   and Michie, S. (2008). A taxonomy of behaviour change techniques used in
   interventions. Health Psychology, 27(3), 379-387.] in order to optimise
   the reporting and scientific study of behaviour change interventions.
   Methods: Three UK study centres collaborated in applying this existing
   taxonomy to two systematic reviews of interventions to increase physical
   activity and healthy eating. The taxonomy was refined in iterative steps
   of (1) coding intervention descriptions, and assessing inter-rater
   reliability, (2) identifying gaps and problems across study centres and
   (3) refining the labels and definitions based on consensus discussions.
   Results: Labels and definitions were improved for all techniques,
   conceptual overlap between categories was resolved, some categories were
   split and 14 techniques were added, resulting in a 40-item taxonomy.
   Inter-rater reliability, assessed on 50 published intervention
   descriptions, was good (kappa = 0.79). Conclusions: This taxonomy can be
   used to improve the specification of interventions in published reports,
   thus improving replication, implementation and evidence syntheses. This
   will strengthen the scientific study of behaviour change and
   intervention development.

   susceptible to anxiety states. Researches in this field have advanced
   significantly with the development of specific instruments to evaluate
   music performance anxiety, such as the Kenny Music Performance Anxiety

   translating, adapting and validating the K-MPAI to the Portuguese
   language. Methods: After the written consent given by the author of the
   original K-MPAI scale, the K-MPAI scale was translated and validated for
   Portuguese idiom. The Portuguese-version of K-MPAI was then applied to
   218 amateur and professional musicians of both genders. For the
   concurrent validation, the validated Portuguese-version of the State
   Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used. Results: Analysis of the
   internal consistency demonstrated a Cronbach's alpha = 0.957, with p <
   0.001, replicated with p = 0.378 and the concurrent validation with the
   State Trait Anxiety Inventory, demonstrated a Cronbach's alpha = 0.642
   and p < 0.001. Discussion: The study allows evaluating data samples with
   high levels of reliability and replicability, which translates this
   study based on an unbiased sample and replicable to other populations.
   The concurrent validation between K-MPAI and IDATE, allows inferring
   that the scales are comparable in their capability of measuring anxiety
   levels in musicians.

   to this paradigm have also been examined. After comparing the reports,
   we are of the opinion that to improve replicability of any given model
   and its antipsychotic screening potential and the reliability of
   comparisons made, efforts need to be directed towards cross-laboratory
   standardization of variables that may confound experimental outcomes and
   cause discrepancies in results reported. In keeping with an earlier
   suggestion this may be facilitated through the creation of an online
   consortium for behavioural neuroscientists to share and compare
   methodologies, laboratory layouts and perhaps even raw data. Behavioural

AB The empirical study we present here deals with a pedagogical issue that
   has not been thoroughly explored up until now in our field. Previous
   empirical studies in other sectors have identified the opinions of
   researchers about this topic, showing that completely unacceptable
   interpretations have been made of significance tests and other
   statistical resources. We tried to show the degree to which these errors
   of interpretation appear in a sample of university professors and
   researchers. To evaluate the beliefs and opinions of the university
   professors about certain methodological and statistical questions, we
   adapted the "Psychometrics Group Instrument" questionnaire by Mittag
   (1999) and Mittag and Thompson (Educational Researcher 29:14-20, 2000).
   We specifically wanted to detect opinions about: (1) avoiding
   inappropriate interpretations, (2) rectifying incorrect uses, (3)
   creating a debate on possible alternatives, and (4) proposing editorial
   changes in the publication criteria. In this study, we compare the
   results we obtained with those obtained by two other equivalent studies
   (Gordon, Journal of Vocational Educational Research 26:1-18, 2001;
   Mittag and Thompson, Educational Researcher 29:14-20, 2000). The
   characteristics of the sample and the scope of the results are
   described, and a critical reflection is carried out on typical
   misunderstandings in interpretation that show a worrisome lack of
   understanding of some basic methodological and statistical concepts.

AB The aim of this paper is to make the case for a systematic engagement of
   transition studies with complexity theory and research. We argue that
   transition research is important for the understanding and development
   of possible sustainable future pathways. However, there are several
   controversies in transition research, including, the role of agency in
   transitions; the relationships between levels (niche, regime and
   landscapes); the origin of transitions; the identification of a
   transition, including starting and ending point of transition processes;
   and the paradox of replicability and scaling up of independent
   experiments. We argue that transition research, and future studies can
   benefit from taking complexity theory seriously. In the paper, we
   elaborate four insights from complexity studies that can move the
   research agenda of transition studies forward: empirically investigating
   the degree of complexity of a system; investigating complexity at the
   level of the policy-making system; longitudinal and retrospective
   research designs for the identification of transitions; methodological
   tools which accommodate complexity, such as agent-based modeling and
   ARIMA modeling. Further, we suggest how these can improve our knowledge
   of transitions towards sustainable future. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate by means of classical test
   theory and Rasch analysis the scaling characteristics and psychometric
   properties of the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) in polio survivors. A
   questionnaire, consisting of five general questions (sex, age, age at
   time of acute polio, sequelae of polio, and new symptoms), the FSS, and
   three questions from the Visual Analog Scale questions on fatigue was
   sent to all 196 polio survivors at the Institute for Rehabilitation in
   Ljubljana. Responses were assessed in terms of Cronbach's alpha,
   item-to-total correlation, factor analysis, and Rasch analysis. Of the
   128 (65.3%) valid questionnaires returned, those presenting no missing
   values were used for subsequent analyses (n = 117). The FSS showed good
   internal consistency: Cronbach's alpha was greater than 0.95,
   item-to-total correlation ranged from 0.68 to 0.88. A reduction from
   seven to three rating categories was necessary to comply with criteria
   for correct category function. Item difficulty estimates spanned from -
   0.91 to + 1.09 logits. No item bias was found for sex and age. The
   internal consistency of FSS was high and its item separation reliability
   good, indicating a satisfactory replicability of item placement in other
   samples. In conclusion, Rasch analysis enabled us to confirm the
   validity of FSS (in its 8-item version, without item 1) as a measure of
   the severity and impact of physical symptoms of fatigue in polio
   survivors, so providing a useful starting point for further studies
   aimed at examining additional psychometric aspects and confirming the
   appropriateness of the simplification of its rating categories.

AB The effectiveness of computer speech recognition as an objective measure
   of intelligibility was explored. A commercially available program was
   assessed following the manufacturer's protocol to analyze speech samples
   from three speakers without neurogenic speech disorders, one speaker
   with moderate spastic dysarthria, and a synthesized speech sample. The
   system identified the synthesized speech most accurately, and the speech
   of the speaker with dysarthria least accurately. To improve clinical
   relevance, a variation of the recommended protocol was performed. The
   first author provided a referent speech sample, and typically used
   intelligibility tests produced by three speakers with dysarthria were
   assessed. These results were compared with intelligibility judgments
   from a large number of everyday listeners. Compared to the everyday
   listener results, the software judged all samples much less accurately.
   Single word intelligibility was particularly disparate because of the
   prediction model used by the recognition system. In addition,
   replicability was poorer than expected, again, due to the prediction
   model. Further work, modifying the software's referent sample as well as
   assessing other recognition programs, is proposed. These programs have
   the potential for providing reliable pre-post therapy analysis and a
   stable point of comparison across clinicians and settings.

AB Objectives To demonstrate a statistical analysis for testing the
   measurement equivalence of a patient safety survey instrument. The
   survey instrument examined in the present study is the Medication
   Administration Error Reporting Survey.
   Methods Surveys were posted to a random sample of registered nurses in
   the State of Texas, with 435 nurses completing the survey. The surveys
   contained questions about various error reporting issues, including the
   16-item, Medication Administration Error Reporting scale. Nurses were
   divided into one of two samples-calibration and holdout-to ensure
   replicability of the results. Within each sample, two groups were
   created based on nurse tenure on the job.
   Results Multiple Group Confirmatory Factor Analysis was conducted across
   nurses with varying levels of experience for the calibration and holdout
   samples. For each sample, a baseline model was estimated, where model
   parameters were allowed to vary across the nursing groups, and compared
   with more restrictive models. The results provided support for the
   factor structure of the Medication Administration Error Reporting System
   but yielded mixed results concerning the equivalence of the measure
   across nursing groups.
   Conclusions The present study provides an explanation of how to examine
   the measurement equivalence of survey instruments and demonstrated that
   the Medication Administration Error Reporting scale might not be
   equivalent across nurses who differ with respect to experience levels.

AB The development of a typology of community college students is a topic
   of long-standing and growing interest among educational researchers,
   policy-makers, administrators, and other stakeholders, but prior work on
   this topic has been limited in a number of important ways. In this
   paper, I develop a behavioral typology based on students' course-taking
   and other enrollment patterns during a seven-year observation period.
   Drawing on data for a population of 165,921 first-time college students,
   I identify six clusters of behaviors: transfer, vocational, drop-in,
   noncredit, experimental, and exploratory. I describe each of these
   student types in terms of distinguishing course-taking and enrollment
   behaviors, representation in the first-time student cohort, predominant
   demographic characteristics, and self-reported academic goal. I test the
   predictive validity of the classification scheme with respect to
   long-term academic outcomes. I investigate the relationships between the
   primary classification scheme and several alternative classification
   schemes. Finally, I demonstrate the replicability of the classification
   scheme with an alternate cohort of students.

PD OCT 28 2010

AB Background: MS-pathogenesis is known to involve both multiple
   environmental events, and several independent genetic risk-factors.
   Methods: A model of susceptibility is developed and a mathematical
   analysis undertaken to elucidate the nature of genetic susceptibility to
   MS and to understand the constraints that are placed on the genetic
   basis of MS, both by the known epidemiological facts of this disease and
   by the known frequency of the HLA DRB1*1501 allele in the general
   populations of northern Europe and North America.
   Results: For the large majority of cases (possibly all), MS develops, in
   part, because an individual is genetically susceptible. Nevertheless,
   2.2% or less of the general population is genetically susceptible.
   Moreover, from the model, the number of susceptibility-loci that need to
   be in a "susceptible allelic state" to produce MS-susceptibility is
   small (11-18), whereas the total number of such susceptibility-loci is
   large (50-200), and their "frequency of susceptibility" is low (i.e., <=
   0.12). The optimal solution to the model equations (which occurs when
   80% of the loci are recessive) predicts the epidemiological data quite
   closely.
   Conclusions: The model suggests that combinations of only a small number
   of genetic loci in a "susceptible allelic state" produce
   MS-susceptibility. Nevertheless, genome-wide associations studies with
   hundreds of thousands of SNPs, are plagued by both false-positive and
   false-negative identifications and, consequently, emphasis has been
   rightly placed on the replicability of findings. Nevertheless, because
   genome-wide screens don't distinguish between true susceptibility-loci
   and disease-modifying-loci, and because only true susceptibility-loci
   are constrained by the model, unraveling the two will not be possible
   using this approach. The model also suggests that HLA DRB1 may not be as
   uniquely important for MS-susceptibility as currently believed. Thus,
   this allele is only one among a hundred or more loci involved in MS
   susceptibility. Even though the "frequency of susceptibility" at the HLA
   DRB1 locus is four-fold that of other loci, the penetrance of those
   susceptible genotypes that include this allele is no different from
   those that don't. Also, almost 50% of genetically-susceptible
   individuals, lack this allele. Moreover, of those who have it, only a
   small fraction (<= 5.2%) are even susceptible to getting MS.
