AB John Dalton's atomic theory, with its postulate of compound formation
   through atom-to-atom combination, brought a new perspective to weight
   relationships in chemical reactions. A presumed one-to-one combination
   of atoms A and B to form a simple compound AB allowed Dalton to
   construct his first table of relative atomic weights from literature
   analyses of appropriate binary compounds. For such simple binary
   compounds, the atomic theory had little advantages over affinity theory
   as an explanation of fixed proportions by weight. For ternary compounds
   of the form AB(2), however, atomic theory made quantitative predictions
   that were not deducible from affinity theory. Atomic theory required
   that the weight of B in the compound AB(2) be exactly twice that in the
   compound AB. Dalton, Thomas Thomson and William Hyde Wollaston all
   published within a few years of each other experimental data that
   claimed to give the predicted results with the required accuracy. There
   are nonetheless several experimental barriers to obtaining the desired
   integral multiple proportions. In this paper I will discuss replication
   experiments which demonstrate that only Wollaston's results are
   experimentally reliable. It is likely that such replicability explains
   why Wollaston's experiments were so influential.

   Decathlon China 2013. This paper presents the prototype's passive
   strategies, active systems and performance results. The limitations,
   future perspectives and potential for replicability and transposition of
   Solark I are also discussed. Through a whole-building design process,
   Solark I effectively integrates all aspects of weather data analysis,
   building design, building envelope design, photovoltaic system design,
   solar hot water system design and heating, ventilating, and air
   conditioning system design to minimize energy consumption and
   environmental impacts. Solark I achieved an excellent balance between
   passive strategies and highly efficient active systems. These design
   decisions help Solark I to maintain its hydrothermal comfort and perform
   all regular tasks with minimum energy consumption. This low energy
   consumption allows Solark I to obtain a positive energy balance both in
   annual energy simulations and on-site during the monitored period.

AB Background: The importance of medical education research in Saudi Arabia
   has been acknowledged increasingly and a lot of concepts used have been
   derived from the Western world. The question arises, however, whether
   Western concepts and questionnaires are transferable to societies with
   different cultures. The aim of this study was to investigate the
   instrument structure and the reliability of the Arabic version of the
   Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire-medium ( ZKPQ-m).
   Methods: Three statistical methods with decreased amount of strictness
   were used to analyse our data: Confirmatory Factor Analysis, Procrustes
   rotation and Principal Component Analysis.
   Results: Our outcomes did not confirm the original instrument structure.
   Instead, we found four interpretable components: Emotional Instability,
   Impulse-seeking, Activeness and Self-Control. However, the amount of
   explained variance was not very high and the internal consistencies
   ranged from unsatisfactory to only moderate. The data showed a high
   percentage of respondents agreeing with more than three items of the
   Infrequency scale, which may be attributable to the collectivistic
   culture in Saudi Arabia.
   Conclusion: We did not succeed in replicating the ZKPQ structure in the
   Arabic context. Social desirability, a common characteristic in
   collectivistic cultures, may have reduced the replicability of the
   internal structure of the ZKPQ-m. Different methods to measure concepts
   in collectivistic cultures may help to get round social desirability.

AB Human height is associated with risk of multiple diseases and is
   profoundly determined by an individual's genetic makeup and shows a high
   degree of ethnic heterogeneity. Large-scale genome-wide association
   (GWA) analyses of adult height in Europeans have identified nearly 180
   genetic loci. A recent study showed high replicability of results from
   Europeans-based GWA studies in Asians; however, population-specific loci
   may exist due to distinct linkage disequilibrium patterns. We carried
   out a GWA meta-analysis in 93 926 individuals from East Asia. We
   identified 98 loci, including 17 novel and 81 previously reported loci,
   associated with height at P<5x10(-8), together explaining 8.89% of
   phenotypic variance. Among the newly identified variants, 10 are
   commonly distributed (minor allele frequency, MAF > 5%) in Europeans,
   with comparable frequencies with in Asians, and 7single-nucleotide
   polymorphisms are with low frequency (MAF <5%) in Europeans. In
   addition, our data suggest that novel biological pathway such as the
   protein tyrosine phosphatase family is involved in regulation of height.
   The findings from this study considerably expand our knowledge of the
   genetic architecture of human height in Asians.

AB In a recent article, Cumming (2014) called for two major changes to how
   psychologists conduct research. The first suggested change encouraging
   transparency and replication is clearly worthwhile, but we question the
   wisdom of the second suggested change: abandoning p-values in favor of
   reporting confidence intervals (CIs) only in all psychological research
   reports. This article has three goals. First, we correct the false
   impression created by Cumming that the debate about the usefulness of
   NHST has been won by its critics. Second, we take issue with the implied
   connection between the use of NHST and the current crisis of
   replicability in psychology. Third, while we agree with other critics of
   Cumming (2014) that hypothesis testing is an important part of science
   (Morey et al., 2014), we express skepticism that alternative hypothesis
   testing frameworks, such as Bayes factors, are a solution to the
   replicability crisis. Poor methodological practices can compromise the
   validity of Bayesian and classic statistical analyses alike. When it
   comes to choosing between competing statistical approaches, we highlight
   the value of applying the same standards of evidence that psychologists
   demand in choosing between competing substantive hypotheses.

   employed, although the ability to resolve conflict was related to
   children's level of bilingual experience.

AB Numerous recommendations for improving the dependability of research
   findings in psychological science have emerged in recent years.
   Unfortunately, this glut of recommendations proves problematic for
   advancing uniform solutions to improve research dependability by
   individuals within and across the various constituencies that comprise
   psychological science. Moreover, several dependability recommendations
   propose practices to address the problem of false positive findings that
   can inversely increase the problem of false negative findings, and vice
   versa. It is proposed that the solution to this conundrum is to develop
   a concise and concrete list of core research dependability
   recommendations that address problems of false positive and false
   negative findings in a noncontradicting manner. Examination of the
   current research dependability literature and earlier literatures
   dealing with the problem of false findings is used to arrive at a set of
   three core research dependability recommendations: (a) conduct and
   promote direct replication studies; (b) ensure data sharing when
   requested by fellow scientists; and (c) adopt and promote a truth
   seeking mindset during the research endeavor.

AB A central feature of HIV-1 infection is the inability of entering virus
   to integrate into chromosomes of resting T lymphocytes unless they are
   mitogenically activated. In contrast, SIVpbj1.9 replicates in initially
   resting T lymphocytes by activating infected cells. Previous reports
   have shown that a difference in Nef-mediated T cell activation between
   HIV-1 and SIVpbj1.9 plays a critical role in the differing abilities of
   these viruses to replicate in resting lymphocytes. However, the
   molecular details of these differences are still unclear. Here, we show
   that infection with a chimeric virus, HSIVnef, which harbors the 5' 308
   nucleotides of SIVpbj1.9 nef in place of the 5' 221 nucleotides of HIV-1
   nef in the HIV-1 proviral backbone, resulted in integration of the
   provirus into host chromosomes without mitogenic activation and thereby
   replication in resting human PBMCs (hPBMCs). These results indicate that
   Nef is an essential viral determinant for the integration of provirus
   into host chromosomes in resting T cells. Using the yeast two-hybrid
   system, we identified integrase interactor-1 (INI1/SMARCB1) as a
   cellular factor that is involved in the integration process via
   interaction with Nef. Although INI1 interacted with both SIVpbj1.9 and
   HIV-1 Nefs, SIVpbj1.9 Nef, but not HIV-1 Nef, enhanced proviral
   integration into host DNA. Furthermore, mutational analysis revealed
   that the basic-amino-acid-rich amino-terminal domain in SIVpbj1.9 Nef is
   crucial for interaction with INI1 and virus replication in resting
   hPBMCs. Taken together, these data indicate that Nef is a critical viral
   protein for incorporating nascent proviral DNA into host chromosomes in
   resting PBMCs and that this occurs through interaction with INI1. This
   elucidates the basis for replication of the integrated provirus when the
   host cell is in a resting state.

AB Scientists in the Netherlands are cultivating edible insects to address
   concerns of international food security. Committed to the One World, One
   Health (OWOH) movement, their research aims to create a safe and
   effective global solution to the conjoined problems of climate change
   and an increasing worldwide demand for protein. Their preliminary work
   is promising, as it suggests that when compared to other sources of
   meat, insects can be an efficient, safe, and low-impact source of
   nutrients. Additionally, in many sites with endemic malnutrition, people
   find insects tasty. The problem these scientists are grappling with,
   however, is that insects that are easily mass-produced are not the
   insects people typically want to eat. This paper shows how the
   contingency of edibility complicates existing scientific models of
   travel that posit that singular objects spread peripherally outwards
   from a center into a globally connected, singular world. The scientists
   are finding that the production of successful food products necessitates
   that insects be constantly tinkered with: there is no "insect" that can
   be globally edible since "the global" itself is not a singular entity.
   This in turn complicates the vision of replicability and "scaling up"
   inherent in an OWOH vision of science. The researchers' process of
   moving their goods from the laboratory boxes they work with into the
   mealtime practices they seek to impact is compelling them to cultivate
   and articulate new ideals for research, methods of translation, and
   pathways by which goods can travel. They are finding that if they want
   to affect the health of "the world," they must engage with many
   different worlds.

AB Background: Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) are neurodevelopmental
   conditions characterized by difficulties in communication and social
   interaction, alongside unusually repetitive behaviours and narrow
   interests. Asperger Syndrome (AS) is one subgroup of ASC and differs
   from classic autism in that in AS there is no language or general
   cognitive delay. Genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors are
   implicated in ASC and genes involved in neural connectivity and
   neurodevelopment are good candidates for studying the susceptibility to
   ASC. The aryl-hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator 2 (ARNT2) gene
   encodes a transcription factor involved in neurodevelopmental processes,
   neuronal connectivity and cellular responses to hypoxia. A mutation in
   this gene has been identified in individuals with ASC and single
   nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been nominally associated with AS
   and autistic traits in previous studies.
   Methods: In this study, we tested 34 SNPs in ARNT2 for association with
   AS in 118 cases and 412 controls of Caucasian origin. P values were
   adjusted for multiple comparisons, and linkage disequilibrium (LD) among
   the SNPs analysed was calculated in our sample. Finally, SNP annotation
   allowed functional and structural analyses of the genetic variants in
   ARNT2. We tested the replicability of our result using the genome-wide
   association studies (GWAS) database of the Psychiatric Genomics
   Consortium (PGC).
   Results: We report statistically significant association of rs17225178
   with AS. This SNP modifies transcription factor binding sites and
   regions that regulate the chromatin state in neural cell lines. It is
   also included in a LD block in our sample, alongside other genetic
   variants that alter chromatin regulatory regions in neural cells.
   Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that rs17225178 in the ARNT2
   gene is associated with AS and support previous studies that pointed out
   an involvement of this gene in the predisposition to ASC.

AB Background: This investigation aimed to develop a screening tool based
   on the Cognitive Inventory of Subjective Distress (CISD). Two studies
   were designed in order to test the second-order factorial structure of
   the CISD, to shorten its length and to assess its replicability on a
   second large independent sample.
   Methods: We recruited a first sample (n = 290) living at home or in
   retirement centers and a second community-based sample (n = 1,429). The
   first sample completed the original CISD as well as cognitive, autonomy,
   anxiety, and depression assessments. The second sample completed the
   Short-CISD (S-CISD).
   Results: Factor analyses supported a second-order factorial structure
   allowing to engage in a refinement of the scale. We retained seven items
   corresponding to a dimension of cognitive schemas. Confirmatory Factor
   Analysis (CFA) demonstrated that the S-CISD exhibited satisfying
   psychometric properties as well as factorial replicability and
   structural invariance in two different samples. Further, the internal
   consistency of the S-CISD is acceptable.
   Conclusion: The S-CISD is a relevant screening tool for rapidly
   assessing psychological distress. It is directed towards old and very
   old individuals either living at home or in a retirement center, while
   also taking into account the fatigability and potential cognitive
   impairment of this population. This screening tool can be confidently
   used for psychopathological assessment and can serve as a baseline for
   following patients over time or in the course of therapy.

AB Objective: The authors sought to demonstrate that schizophrenia is a
   heterogeneous group of heritable disorders caused by different genotypic
   networks that cause distinct clinical syndromes.
   Method: In a large genome-wide association study of cases with
   schizophrenia and controls, the authors first identified sets of
   interacting single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that cluster within
   particular individuals (SNP sets) regardless of clinical status. Second,
   they examined the risk of schizophrenia for each SNP set and tested
   replicability in two independent samples. Third, they identified
   genotypic networks composed of SNP sets sharing SNPs or subjects.
   Fourth, they identified sets of distinct clinical features that cluster
   in particular cases (phenotypic sets or clinical syndromes) without
   regard for their genetic background. Fifth, they tested whether SNP sets
   were associated with distinct phenotypic sets in a replicable manner
   across the three studies.
   Results: The authors identified 42 SNP sets associated with a 70% or
   greater risk of schizophrenia, and confirmed 34 (81%) or more with
   similar high risk of schizophrenia in two independent samples. Seventeen
   networks of SNP sets did not share any SNP or subject. These disjoint
   genotypic networks were associated with distinct gene products and
   clinical syndromes (i.e., the schizophrenias) varying in symptoms and
   severity. Associations between genotypic networks and clinical syndromes
   were complex, showing multifinality and equifinality. The interactive
   networks explained the risk of schizophrenia more than the average
   effects of all SNPs (24%).
   Conclusions: Schizophrenia is a group of heritable disorders caused by a
   moderate number of separate genotypic networks associated with several
   distinct clinical syndromes.

AB Introduction: The Childhood Obesity Research Demonstration (CORD)
   project links public health and primary care interventions in three
   projects described in detail in accompanying articles in this issue of
   Childhood Obesity. This article describes a comprehensive evaluation
   plan to determine the extent to which the CORD model is associated with
   changes in behavior, body weight, BMI, quality of life, and healthcare
   satisfaction in children 2-12 years of age.
   Design/Methods: The CORD Evaluation Center (EC-CORD) will analyze the
   pooled data from three independent demonstration projects that each
   integrate public health and primary care childhood obesity
   interventions. An extensive set of common measures at the family,
   facility, and community levels were defined by consensus among the CORD
   projects and EC-CORD. Process evaluation will assess reach, dose
   delivered, and fidelity of intervention components. Impact evaluation
   will use a mixed linear models approach to account for heterogeneity
   among project-site populations and interventions. Sustainability
   evaluation will assess the potential for replicability, continuation of
   benefits beyond the funding period, institutionalization of the
   intervention activities, and community capacity to support ongoing
   program delivery. Finally, cost analyses will assess how much benefit
   can potentially be gained per dollar invested in programs based on the
   CORD model.
   Conclusions: The keys to combining and analyzing data across multiple
   projects include the CORD model framework and common measures for the
   behavioral and health outcomes along with important covariates at the
   individual, setting, and community levels. The overall objective of the
   comprehensive evaluation will develop evidence-based recommendations for
   replicating and disseminating community-wide, integrated public health
   and primary care programs based on the CORD model.

AB Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating mutations are a
   predictor of tyrosine kinase inhibitor effectiveness in the treatment of
   non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The objective of this study is to
   build a model for predicting the EGFR mutation status of brain
   metastasis in patients with NSCLC.
   Observation and model set-up.
   This study was conducted between January 2003 and December 2011 in 6
   medical centers in Southwest China.
   The study included 31 NSCLC patients with brain metastases.
   Eligibility requirements were histological proof of NSCLC, as well as
   sufficient quantity of paraffin-embedded lung and brain metastases
   specimens for EGFR mutation detection. The linear discriminant analysis
   (LDA) method was used for analyzing the dimensional reduction of
   clinical features, and a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was
   employed to generate an EGFR mutation model for NSCLC brain metastases.
   Training-testing-validation (3 : 1 : 1) processes were applied to find
   the best fit in 12 patients (validation test set) with NSCLC and brain
   metastases treated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and whole-brain
   radiotherapy.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures: EGFR mutation analysis in
   patients with NSCLC and brain metastases and the development of a
   LDA-SVM-based EGFR mutation model for NSCLC brain metastases patients.
   EGFR mutation discordance between the primary lung tumor and brain
   metastases was found in 5 patients. Using LDA, 13 clinical features were
   transformed into 9 characteristics, and 3 were selected as primary
   vectors. The EGFR mutation model constructed with SVM algorithms had an
   accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for determining the mutation
   status of brain metastases of 0.879, 0.886, and 0.875, respectively.
   Furthermore, the replicability of our model was confirmed by testing 100
   random combinations of input values.
   The LDA-SVM-based model developed in this study could predict the EGFR
   status of brain metastases in this small cohort of patients with NSCLC.
   Further studies with larger cohorts should be carried out to validate
   our findings in the clinical setting.

AB H9N2 avian influenza viruses are enzootic around the world and can
   infect many different avian and mammalian hosts, including humans.
   Unlike the H9N2 viruses, which mainly originated in other countries and
   possess a non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of 230 aa, 98 % of the H9N2
   viruses isolated in China lack the 13 aa at the C terminus of NS1 (217
   aa in total). The biological significance of NS1 elongation remains
   elusive. To examine the effect of NS1 C-terminal elongation in the
   influenza virus, we used reverse genetics to generate a wt avian
   influenza H9N2 virus containing a 217 aa NS1 (H9N2NS1217) and two mutant
   viruses with elongated NS1s of 230 and 237 aa (H9N2NS1230 and
   H9N2NS1237). C-terminal elongation of NS1 did not have a significant
   impact on virus replication in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells or DF-1
   cells. The three variants exhibited similar replicability in mice;
   however, the H9N2NS1230 and H9N2NS1237 variants exhibited an
   upregulation in the level of inflammatory cytokines. In addition, both
   the H9N2NS1230 and H9N2NS1237 viruses increased replication and induced
   a high level of inflammatory cytokines and transmission in chickens,
   compared with the wt virus. These findings suggest that the NS1
   extension conferred a gain of fitness to some extent.

AB In this article, we report on an attempt to replicate findings with
   social axioms. Participants from 33 countries (total N = 7,825) were
   given a 30-item questionnaire based on the work of Leung et al. Several
   different methods of factor analysis were used, and individual-level as
   well as the aggregated (nation-level) data were examined. The
   five-factor structure of social axioms did replicate at the individual
   level. At the country and world regions level of analysis, however, our
   findings differ from what has been reported previously. As before, the
   most pronounced arithmetic mean differences were obtained on
   Religiosity, with South East Asian region and Malaysia in particular
   scoring high and Western Europe, especially Spain, being low. Even
   though cross-cultural differences in Social Complexity were not
   pronounced, they are comparable in size with what has been reported for
   social attitudes. Differences between world regions on Social Cynicism,
   Fate Control, and Reward for Application were in-between those for
   Religiosity and Social Complexity. These results indicate that social
   axioms are useful constructs for cross-cultural comparisons.

AB The purpose of the present study was to examine the factor structure and
   assess the reliability of the Chinese Conformity to Masculine Norms
   Inventory-46 (CCMNI-46). Using a cohort of 254 Hong Kong-born Chinese
   males, scale reliability determination involved the internal
   consistencies of the entire instrument. Ages of respondents ranged from
   18 to 81years (M = 38.05; SD = 17.3). Confirmatory factor analysis
   provided support for the psychometric properties of the CCMNI-46, thus
   confirming the multidimensional structure of the CMNI-46 and the
   replicability of the CMNI using a Hong Kong Chinese sample. All items
   loaded onto the corresponding factor with the exception of one item from
   the emotional control subscale. The overall reliability of the CCMNI-46
   was lower than previous Western studies and may well reflect the subtle
   diversity of masculinity across cultures. The findings offered
   psychometric support for use of the CCMNI-46 in research and practice
   regarding Hong Kong Chinese masculinity. The CCMNI-46 provides a useful
   template for the operationalization of masculine norms in Chinese
   society.

AB There is increasing awareness of the interplay among sleep, circadian
   rhythms, and psychopathology. Recent findings show that
   obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is associated with late bedtimes.
   Sleep disruption may exacerbate impairments in executive functioning in
   individuals with OCD, making these individuals vulnerable to
   experiencing intrusive thoughts that come from "out of the blue"
   (autogenous obsessions; AO) and to having difficulty dismissing them.
   The current study investigated types of intrusive thoughts experienced
   by individuals with (DB) and without (NDB) delayed bedtimes. Bedtime,
   and AO (uncued, affectively negative) vs. reactive obsessions (RO;
   triggered by environment, affectively neutral) were examined in 212
   adults. As hypothesized, individuals with DB reported more frequent
   intrusive thoughts, as well as more AO, than NDB individuals.
   Additionally, DB participants reported a greater urge to neutralize
   intrusive thoughts than NDB participants. Future work should test the
   replicability of these findings and explore circadian disruptions in OCD
   using biological markers.

AB When coding events from media sources - as the majority of data projects
   do - different reports may oftentimes contain contradictory information.
   What do coders make of this? It is up to them to aggregate different
   reports into one coded event, and to supplement missing information
   based on other sources or their own background information. If not
   addressed properly, this may lead to a lack of replicability and to low
   reliability of the final data product. In this short article, we present
   an approach for separating (i) event reports and the information
   contained in them, and (ii) events, which are based on aggregate
   information from the reports and constitute the final data product. Our
   procedure preserves uncertainty arising from multiple reports and gives
   the user control over how missing and conflicting information should be
   dealt with. We illustrate our procedure with data from a current coding
   project, the Mass Mobilization in Autocracies Database (MMAD).

AB In the European registration procedure for pesticides, microcosm and
   mesocosm studies are the highest aquatic experimental tier to assess
   their environmental effects. Evaluations of microcosm/mesocosm studies
   rely heavily on no observed effect concentrations (NOECs) calculated for
   different population-level endpoints. Ideally, a power analysis should
   be reported for the concentration-response relationships underlying
   these NOECs, as well as for measurement endpoints for which significant
   effects cannot be demonstrated. An indication of this statistical power
   can be provided a posteriori by calculated minimum detectable
   differences (MDDs). The MDD defines the difference between the means of
   a treatment and the control that must exist to detect a statistically
   significant effect. The aim of this paper is to expand on the Aquatic
   Guidance Document recently published by the European Food Safety
   Authority (EFSA) and to propose a procedure to report and evaluate NOECs
   and related MDDs in a harmonised way. In addition, decision schemes are
   provided on how MDDs can be used to assess the reliability of
   microcosm/mesocosm studies and for the derivation of effect classes used
   to derive regulatory acceptable concentrations. Furthermore, examples
   are presented to show how MDDs can be reduced by optimising experimental
   design and sampling techniques.

AB The importance of replication has been recognised across many scientific
   disciplines. Reproducibility is a necessary condition for replicability,
   because an inability to reproduce results implies that the methods have
   not been specified sufficiently, thus precluding replication. This paper
   describes how two independent teams of researchers attempted to
   reproduce the empirical findings of an important paper, "Shrinkage
   estimators of time series seasonal factors and their effect on
   forecasting accuracy" (Miller & Williams, 2003). The two teams proceeded
   systematically, reporting results both before and after receiving
   clarifications from the authors of the original study. The teams were
   able to approximately reproduce each other's results, but not those of
   Miller and Williams. These discrepancies led to differences in the
   conclusions as to the conditions under which seasonal damping
   outperforms classical decomposition. The paper specifies the forecasting
   methods employed using a flowchart. It is argued that this approach to
   method documentation is complementary to the provision of computer code,
   as it is accessible to a broader audience of forecasting practitioners
   and researchers. The significance of this research lies not only in its
   lessons for seasonal forecasting but also, more generally, in its
   approach to the reproduction of forecasting research. (C) 2014

AB It is a widely held belief that bilinguals have an advantage over
   monolinguals in executive-control tasks, but is this what all studies
   actually demonstrate? The idea of a bilingual advantage may result from
   a publication bias favoring studies with positive results over studies
   with null or negative effects. To test this hypothesis, we looked at
   conference abstracts from 1999 to 2012 on the topic of bilingualism and
   executive control. We then determined which of the studies they reported
   were subsequently published. Studies with results fully supporting the
   bilingual-advantage theory were most likely to be published, followed by
   studies with mixed results. Studies challenging the bilingual advantage
   were published the least. This discrepancy was not due to differences in
   sample size, tests used, or statistical power. A test for funnel-plot
   asymmetry provided further evidence for the existence of a publication
   bias.

AB Context: Gamification seeks for improvement of the user's engagement,
   motivation, and performance when carrying out a certain task, by means
   of incorporating game mechanics and elements, thus making that task more
   attractive. Much research work has studied the application of
   gamification in software engineering for increasing the engagement and
   results of developers.
   Objective: The objective of this paper is to carry out a systematic
   mapping of the field of gamification in software engineering in an
   attempt to characterize the state of the art of this field identifying
   gaps and opportunities for further research.
   Method: We carried out a systematic mapping with a view to finding the
   primary studies in the existing literature, which were later classified
   and analyzed according to four criteria: the software process area
   addressed, the gamification elements used, the type of research method
   followed, and the type of forum in which they were published. A
   subjective evaluation of the studies was also carried out to evaluate
   them in terms of methodology, empirical evidence, integration with the
   organization, and replicability.
   Results: As a result of the systematic mapping we found 29 primary
   studies, published between January 2011 and June 2014. Most of them
   focus on software development, and to a lesser extent, requirements,
   project management, and other support areas. In the main, they consider
   very simple gamification mechanics such as points and badges, and few
   provide empirical evidence of the impact of gamification.
   Conclusions: Existing research in the field is quite preliminary, and
   more research effort analyzing the impact of gamification in SE would be
   needed. Future research work should look at other game mechanics in
   addition to the basic ones and should tackle software process areas that
   have not been fully studied, such as requirements, project management,
   maintenance, or testing. Most studies share a lack of methodological
   support that would make their proposals replicable in other settings.
   The integration of gamification with an organization's existing tools is
   also an important challenge that needs to be taken up in this field. (C)

TI Post-crisis Zimbabwe's innovative financing mechanisms in the social
   sectors: a practical approach to implementing the new deal for
   engagement in fragile states

AB Background: Donor engagement in transitional settings, complex
   emergencies and fragile states is increasing. Neither short-term
   humanitarian aid nor traditional development financing are well adapted
   for such environments. Multi-donor trust funds, in their current form,
   can be unwieldy and subject to long delays in initiation and work best
   when national governments are already strong. We reviewed the aid
   modalities used in Zimbabwe through the period of crisis, 2008-2012 and
   their results and implications. Literature review and case experience
   was utilised.
   Discussion: By focusing on working with line ministries in non-contested
   sectors to determine local priorities rather than following global
   prescriptions, pooling funds to achieve scale rather than delivering
   through fragmented projects, and building on national systems and
   capacities rather than setting up parallel mechanisms, the Transition
   Fund Model employed in Zimbabwe by UNICEF and partners in partnership
   with the Inclusive Government was able to achieve important results in
   health, education, social support and water services in a challenging
   setting. In addition, forums for collaboration were developed that
   provided a platform for further action. The initial emphasis on service
   delivery diffused much of the political delicateness that impeded
   progress in other sectors. The Zimbabwean experience may provide a model
   of innovative financing for countries facing similar circumstances.
   Summary: Such models may represent a new practical application of the
   Paris Principles, consistent with the major tenets of the 2011 New Deal
   for Engagement in Fragile States agreed in Busan. As we approach the
   Millennium Development Goal deadline, an over-arching, mutli-sectoral
   and independent evaluation of this approach is recommended in order to
   validate findings and assess broader replicability of this approach.

AB There has been a substantial increase in the use of personality
   assessment measures constructed using items from the International
   Personality Item Pool (IPIP) such as the 300-item IPIP-NEO (Goldberg,
   1999), a representation of the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO
   PI-R; Costa & McCrae, 1992). The IPIP-NEO is free to use and can be
   modified to accommodate its users' needs. Despite the substantial
   interest in this measure, there is still a dearth of data demonstrating
   its convergence with the NEO PI-R. The present study represents an
   investigation of the reliability and validity of scores on the IPIP-NEO.
   Additionally, we used item response theory (IRT) methodology to create a
   120-item version of the IPIP-NEO. Using an undergraduate sample (n =
   359), we examined the reliability, as well as the convergent and
   criterion validity, of scores from the 300-item IPIP-NEO, a previously
   constructed 120-item version of the IPIP-NEO (Johnson, 2011), and the
   newly created IRT-based IPIP-120 in comparison to the NEO PI-R across a
   range of outcomes. Scores from all 3 IPIP measures demonstrated strong
   reliability and convergence with the NEO PI-R and a high degree of
   similarity with regard to their correlational profiles across the
   criterion variables (r(ICC) = .983,.972, and .976, respectively). The
   replicability of these findings was then tested in a community sample (n
   = 757), and the results closely mirrored the findings from Sample 1.
   These results provide support for the use of the IPIP-NEO and both
   120-item IPIP-NEO measures as assessment tools for measurement of the
   five-factor model.

   persons are replicable and that personal identity does not really

   replicability. Challenging this idea in turn, I explain why persons are
   absolutely not replicable. To prove this I rely on two arguments-the
   Author Argument and the Love Argument. The irreplicability of persons
   relies upon the singularity of each person and thus entails that
   personal identity is irreducible and that it really does matter.

AB Background: Although a number of studies have examined the factor
   structure of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) in
   predominately White or African American samples, no published research
   has reported on the factor structure among Hispanic women who reside in
   the United States. Objective: The current study examined the factor
   structure of the EPDS among Hispanic mothers in the United States.
   Method: Among 220 Hispanic women, drawn from a pediatric primary care
   setting, with an infant aged 0 to 10 months, 6 structural models guided
   by the empirical literature were evaluated using confirmatory factor
   analysis. Results: Results supported a 2-factor model of depression and
   anxiety as the best fitting model. Multigroup models supported the
   factorial invariance across women who completed the EDPS in English and
   Spanish. Conclusion: These findings provide initial support for the
   2-factor structure of the EPDS among Hispanic women in the United
   States. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Crop monitoring during the growing season is important for regional
   management decisions and biomass prediction. The objectives of this
   study were to develop, improve and validate a scale independent biomass
   model. Field studies were conducted in Huimin County, Shandong Province
   of China, during the 2006-2007 growing season of winter wheat (Triticum
   aestivum L). The field design had a multiscale set-up with four levels
   which differed in their management, such as nitrogen fertilizer inputs
   and cultivars, to create different biomass conditions: small
   experimental fields (L1), large experimental fields (L2), small farm
   fields (L3), and large farm fields (L4). L4, planted with different
   winter wheat varieties, was managed according to farmers' practice while
   Li through L3 represented controlled field experiments. Multitemporal
   spectral measurements were taken in the fields, and biomass was sampled
   for each spectral campaign. In addition, multitemporal Hyperion data
   were obtained in 2006 and 2007. Li field data were used to develop
   biomass models based on the relation between the winter wheat spectra
   and biomass: several published vegetation indices, including NRI, REP,
   OSAVI, TCI, and NDVI, were investigated. A new hyperspectral vegetation
   index, which uses a four-band combination in the NIR and SWIR domains,
   named GnyLi, was developed. Following the multiscale concept, the data
   of higher levels (L2 through L4) were used stepwise to validate and
   improve the models of the lower levels, and to transfer the improved
   models to the next level. Lastly, the models were transferred and
   validated at the regional scale using Hyperion images of 2006 and 2007.
   The results showed that the GnyLi and NRI models, which were based on
   the NIR and SWIR domains, performed best with R-2 > 0.74. All the other
   indices explained less than 60% model variability. Using the Hyperion
   data for regionalization, GnyLi and NRI explained 81-89% of the biomass
   variability. These results highlighted that GnyLi and NRI can be used
   together with hyperspectral images for both plot and regional level
   biomass estimation. Nevertheless, additional studies and analyses are
   needed to test its replicability in other environmental conditions. (C)

AB Background: RNA or RNA-like polymers are the most likely candidates for
   having played the lead roles on the stage of the origin of life. RNA is
   known to feature two of the three essential functions of living entities
   (metabolism, heredity and membrane): it is capable of unlimited heredity
   and it has a proven capacity for catalysing very different chemical
   reactions which may form simple metabolic networks. The Metabolically
   Coupled Replicator System is a class of simulation models built on these
   two functions to show that an RNA World scenario for the origin of life
   is ecologically feasible, provided that it is played on mineral
   surfaces. The fact that RNA templates and their copies are of
   complementary base sequences has an obvious dynamical relevance:
   complementary strains may have very different structures and,
   consequently, functions - one may specialize for increasing enzymatic
   activity while the other takes the role of the gene of the enzyme.
   Results: Incorporating the functional divergence of template and copy
   into the Metabolically Coupled Replicator System model framework we show
   that sequence complementarity 1) does not ruin the coexistence of a set
   of metabolically cooperating replicators; 2) the replicator system
   remains resistant to, but also tolerant with its parasites; 3) opens the
   way to the evolutionary differentiation of phenotype and genotype
   through a primitive version of phenotype amplification.
   Conclusions: The functional asymmetry of complementary RNA strains
   results in a shift of phenotype/genotype (enzyme/gene) proportions in
   MCRS, favouring a slight genotype dominance. This asymmetry is expected
   to reverse due to the evolved trade-off of high "gene" replicability and
   high catalytic activity of the corresponding "enzyme" in expense of its
   replicability. This trade-off is the first evolutionary step towards the
   "division of labour" among enzymes and genes, which has concluded in the
   extreme form of phenotype amplification characteristic of our recent
   DNA-RNA protein World.

AB Families can be one of the most protective forces in the lives of
   children and youth. Family skills interventions have been found to be
   effective in encouraging safe and nurturing relationships between
   parents (or caregivers) and children in their early years and as such
   preventing many problem behaviours including violence. Most of the
   evidence in this regards is generated from high income countries. In
   this article UNODC reports on variables associated with violence
   (including conduct problems, stress management, pro-social behaviours,
   family aggression and conflict) generated from a multisite project aimed
   at piloting family skills programmes in low and middle income countries.
   The countries of concern are Panama, Honduras, Guatemala, Serbia,
   Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The
   family skills piloted were Strengthening the Families Programme 10-14
   (SFP 10-14) and Families And Schools Together (FAST). The data generated
   indicates high level of replicability with fidelity, affinity and need
   for such programmes in low and middle income countries with very
   encouraging in preventing violence. Significant changes at the post-test
   level, assessed through multi-sources, were recorded across most of the
   violence indicators assessed related to youth violence and child
   maltreatment at least on a comparable level to high-income countries.

AB Statistical power depends on the size of the effect of interest.
   However, effect sizes are rarely fixed in psychological research: Study
   design choices, such as the operationalization of the dependent variable
   or the treatment manipulation, the social context, the subject pool, or
   the time of day, typically cause systematic variation in the effect
   size. Ignoring this between-study variation, as standard power formulae
   do, results in assessments of power that are too optimistic.
   Consequently, when researchers attempting replication set sample sizes
   using these formulae, their studies will be underpowered and will thus
   fail at a greater than expected rate. We illustrate this with both
   hypothetical examples and data on several well-studied phenomena in
   psychology. We provide formulae that account for between-study variation
   and suggest that researchers set sample sizes with respect to our
   generally more conservative formulae. Our formulae generalize to
   settings in which there are multiple effects of interest. We also
   introduce an easy-to-use website that implements our approach to setting
   sample sizes. Finally, we conclude with recommendations for quantifying
   between-study variation.

AB Although many researchers have discussed replication as a means to
   facilitate self-correcting science, in this article, we identify
   meta-analyses and evaluating the validity of correlational and causal
   inferences as additional processes crucial to self-correction. We argue
   that researchers have a duty to describe sampling decisions they make;
   without such descriptions, self-correction becomes difficult, if not
   impossible. We developed the Replicability and Meta-Analytic Suitability
   Inventory (RAMSI) to evaluate the descriptive adequacy of a sample of
   studies taken from current psychological literature. Authors described
   only about 30% of the sampling decisions necessary for self-correcting
   science. We suggest that a modified RAMSI can be used by authors to
   guide their written reports and by reviewers to inform editorial
   recommendations. Finally, we claim that when researchers do not describe
   their sampling decisions, both readers and reviewers may assume that
   those decisions do not matter to the outcome of the study, do not affect
   inferences made from the research findings, do not inhibit inclusion in
   meta-analyses, and do not inhibit replicability of the study. If these
   assumptions are in error, as they often are, and the neglected decisions
   are relevant, then the neglect may create a good deal of mischief in the
   field.

AB We present the concept of a community-augmented meta-analysis (CAMA), a
   simple yet novel tool that significantly facilitates the accumulation
   and evaluation of previous studies within a specific scientific field. A
   CAMA is a combination of a meta-analysis and an open repository. Like a
   meta-analysis, it is centered around a psychologically relevant topic
   and includes methodological details and standardized effect sizes. As in
   a repository, data do not remain undisclosed and static after
   publication but can be used and extended by the research community, as
   anyone can download all information and can add new data via simple
   forms. Based on our experiences with building three CAMAs, we illustrate
   the concept and explain how CAMAs can facilitate improving our research
   practices via the integration of past research, the accumulation of

   letters corresponding to one of the following six categories: references
   to findings that are Consistent with the current findings, are
   Replicated by the current findings, are Inconsistent with the current
   findings, Failed to be replicated by the current findings, were used to
   build Theory, or were used to cite Methodologies. I explain how the

AB A recent genome-wide-association study of educational attainment
   identified three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) whose
   associations, despite their small effect sizes (each R-2 approximate to
   0.02%), reached genome-wide significance (p < 5 x 10(-8)) in a large
   discovery sample and were replicated in an independent sample (p < .05).
   The study also reported associations between educational attainment and
   indices of SNPs called polygenic scores. In three studies, we evaluated
   the robustness of these findings. Study 1 showed that the associations
   with all three SNPs were replicated in another large (N = 34,428)
   independent sample. We also found that the scores remained predictive
   (R-2 approximate to 2%) in regressions with stringent controls for
   stratification (Study 2) and in new within-family analyses (Study 3).
   Our results show that large and therefore well-powered
   genome-wide-association studies can identify replicable genetic
   associations with behavioral traits. The small effect sizes of
   individual SNPs are likely to be a major contributing factor explaining
   the striking contrast between our results and the disappointing
   replication record of most candidate-gene studies.

AB Background: Previous research mainly focused on responses to negative
   affect in relation to depression, and less on responses to positive
   affect. Cognitive responses to positive affect are interesting in the
   context of emotion regulation and emotion disorders: positive rumination
   is associated to hypomania risk and bipolar disorder. There is to date
   no questionnaire in Swedish that captures the phenomena of cognitive
   response styles. Aims: The aim of this study was to investigate the
   replicability of the Responses to Positive Affect questionnaire (RPA) in
   a newly translated Swedish version and to test its psychometric
   properties. Methods: Swedish undergraduates (n = 111) completed a set of
   self-report questionnaires in a fixed order. Results: The hypothesized
   three-factor model was largely replicated in the subscales Self-focused
   positive rumination, Emotion-focused positive rumination and Dampening.
   The two positive rumination subscales were strongly associated with each
   other and current positive affect. The subscales showed acceptable
   convergent and incremental validity with concurrent measures of
   depression, hypomania, anxiety, repetitive negative thinking, and
   positive and negative affect. The model explained 25% of the variance in
   hypomania, but fell short in the explanation of depression. Conclusions:
   The Swedish version of the RPA shows satisfactory reliability and
   initial findings from a student sample indicate that it is a valid
   measure comparable with the original RPA questionnaire. Results give
   emphasis to the importance of further exploration of cognitive response
   styles in relation to psychopathology.

AB The present study aims to develop a short form of the Perceived

   the short form were first investigated in an Italian sample (n = 697),
   and compared with those of the extended version. The cross-cultural
   replicability of the short form was then investigated in Spain (n =
   354), and Greece (n = 270). Finally, the relations between the PPSE-S
   and several indicators of political participation were assessed in each
   country. Results from confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) supported the
   unidimensionality of the PPSE-S. Reliability and criterion validity of
   the short- and the full-length scales were found to be substantially
   equivalent. Multigroup CFA provided evidence of measurement invariance
   across Italy, Spain, and Greece. Perceived political efficacy was
   positively related to political engagement in a stable and consistent
   way across the three countries. In light of these results, the
   usefulness and applicability of the PPSE-S for large-scale surveys were
   discussed.

AB Following international trends, Turkey has recently introduced
   decentralisation reforms to its highly centralised public administration
   system. These reforms have also applied to the cultural heritage sector,
   where innovative laws since 2004 have allowed local administrations and
   private actors to play new entrepreneurial roles. The Gaziantep
   Metropolitan Municipality has been a pioneer in this process, promoting
   policies that promote cultural tourism as an engine of economic growth.
   Under its leadership, hundreds of historic buildings have been restored,
   nine new museums and heritage sites opened, and museum visitors
   increased tenfold. These positive results make Gaziantep an interesting
   case of successful decentralisation in heritage management. Despite
   these successes, however, the disconnection between rhetoric and
   results, and the fragmentation and ambiguity of responsibilities
   emerging from the decentralisation process raises serious questions
   about its sustainability and replicability.

AB There has been a strong recent interest in applying quantum theory (QT)
   outside physics, including in cognitive science. We analyze the
   applicability of QT to two basic properties in opinion polling. The
   first property (response replicability) is that, for a large class of
   questions, a response to a given question is expected to be repeated if
   the question is posed again, irrespective of whether another question is
   asked and answered in between. The second property (question order
   effect) is that the response probabilities frequently depend on the
   order in which the questions are asked. Whenever these two properties
   occur together, it poses a problem for QT. The conventional QT with
   Hermitian operators can handle response replicability, but only in the
   way incompatible with the question order effect. In the generalization
   of QT known as theory of positive-operator-valued measures (POVMs), in
   order to account for response replicability, the POVMs involved must be
   conventional operators. Although these problems are not unique to QT and
   also challenge conventional cognitive theories, they stand out as
   important unresolved problems for the application of QT to cognition.
   Either some new principles are needed to determine the bounds of
   applicability of QT to cognition, or quantum formalisms more general
   than POVMs are needed.

AB Naturalistic stimuli, such as normal speech and narratives, are opening
   up intriguing prospects in neuroscience, especially when merging
   neuroimaging with machine learning methodology. Here we propose a
   task-optimized spatial filtering strategy for uncovering individual
   magnetoencephalographic (MEG) responses to audiobook stories. Ten
   subjects listened to 1-h-long recording once, as well as to 48
   repetitions of a 1-min-long speech passage. Employing response
   replicability as statistical validity and utilizing unsupervised
   learning methods, we trained spatial filters that were able to
   generalize over datasets of an individual. For this
   blind-signal-separation (BSS) task, we derived a version of multi-set
   similarity-constrained canonical correlation analysis (SimCCA) that
   theoretically provides maximal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in this
   setting. Irrespective of significant noise in unaveraged MEG traces, the
   method successfully uncovered feasible time courses up to similar to 120
   Hz, with the most prominent signals below 20 Hz. Individual
   trial-to-trial correlations of such time courses reached the level of
   0.55 (median 0.33 in the group) at similar to 0.5 Hz, with considerable
   variation between subjects. By this filtering, the SNR increased up to
   20 times. In comparison, independent component analysis (ICA) or
   principal component analysis (PCA) did not improve SNR notably. The
   validity of the extracted brain signals was further assessed by
   inspecting their associations with the stimulus, as well as by mapping
   the contributing cortical signal sources. The results indicate that the
   proposed methodology effectively reduces noise in MEG recordings to that
   extent that brain responses can be seen to nonrecurring audiobook
   stories. The study paves the way for applications aiming at accurately
   modeling the stimulus-response-relationship by tackling the response
   variability, as well as for real-time monitoring of brain signals of
   individuals in naturalistic experimental conditions. (C) 2014 The

AB The authors evaluate the quality of research reported in major journals
   in social-personality psychology by ranking those journals with respect
   to their N-pact Factors (NF)-the statistical power of the empirical
   studies they publish to detect typical effect sizes. Power is a
   particularly important attribute for evaluating research quality
   because, relative to studies that have low power, studies that have high
   power are more likely to (a) to provide accurate estimates of effects,
   (b) to produce literatures with low false positive rates, and (c) to
   lead to replicable findings. The authors show that the average sample
   size in social-personality research is 104 and that the power to detect
   the typical effect size in the field is approximately 50%. Moreover,
   they show that there is considerable variation among journals in sample
   sizes and power of the studies they publish, with some journals
   consistently publishing higher power studies than others. The authors
   hope that these rankings will be of use to authors who are choosing
   where to submit their best work, provide hiring and promotion committees
   with a superior way of quantifying journal quality, and encourage
   competition among journals to improve their NF rankings.

AB Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) offers a unique opportunity to
   measure brain metabolites in-vivo, and in doing so enables one to
   understand the brain function and cellular processes implicated in the
   pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. MRS, in addition to being
   non-invasive, is devoid of radioactive tracers and ionizing radiation, a
   distinct advantage over other imaging modalities like positron emission
   tomography and single photon emission computed tomography. With advances
   in MRS technique it is now possible to quantify concentrations of
   relevant compounds like neurotransmitters, neuronal viability markers
   and pharmacological compounds. Majority of the MRS studies have examined
   the neurometabolites in schizophrenia, a common and debilitating
   psychiatric disorder. Abnormalities in N Acetyl aspartate and Glutamate
   are consistently reported while the reports regarding the myoinsoitol
   and choline are inconsistent. These abnormalities are not changed across
   the illness stages and despite treatment. However, multiple technical
   challenges have limited the widespread use of MRS in psychiatric
   disorders. Guidelines for uniform acquisition and preprocessing are need
   of the hour, which. would increase the replicability and validity of MRS
   measures in psychiatry. Finally long term, prospective, longitudinal
   studies are required in different psychiatric disorders for potential
   clinical applications.

   under normal and UV stressed conditions, we applied the 'not-so-random'
   hexamers priming strategy to RNA sequencing in C. elegans, This NSR-seq
   strategy efficiently depleted rRNA transcripts from the samples and
   showed high technical replicability. We identified more than 1,000
   ncRNAs whose apparent expression was repressed by CEP-1, while around
   200 were activated. Around 40% of the CEP-1 activated ncRNAs promoters
   contain a putative CEP-1-binding site. CEP-1 regulated ncRNAs were

   indicate that numerous ncRNAs are involved in CEP-1 transcriptional

   questions - only six of which, it argues, are critical - the paper
   advances two broad arguments: First, more attention should be paid to
   the fundamentals of social science methodology, that is, concept
   formation, content validity, reliability, replicability, robustness, and
   the relevance of particular measures to underlying research questions.
   Second, less attention should be paid to other issues more commonly
   highlighted in the literature on governance measurement, that is,
   descriptive complexity, theoretical fit, the precision of estimates, and
   'correct' weighting. The paper builds on review of the literature and on
   three years of research in practice in developing a well-known
   governance index.

AB Research often fails to find its way into practice or policy in a timely
   way, if at all. Given the current pressure and pace of health care
   change, many authors have recommended different approaches to make
   health care research more relevant and rapid. An emerging standard for
   research, the "5 R's" is a synthesis of recommendations for care
   delivery research that (1) is relevant to stakeholders; (2) is rapid and
   recursive in application; (3) redefines rigor; (4) reports on resources
   required; and (5) is replicable. Relevance flows from substantive
   ongoing participation by stakeholders. Rapidity and recursiveness occur
   through accelerated design and peer reviews followed by short
   learning/implementation cycles through which questions and answers
   evolve over time. Rigor is the disciplined conduct of shared learning
   within the specific changing situations in diverse settings. Resource
   reporting includes costs of interventions. Replicability involves
   designing for the factors that may affect subsequent implementation of
   an intervention or program in different contexts. These R's of the
   research process are mutually reinforcing and can be supported by
   training that fosters collaborative and reciprocal relationships among
   researchers, implementers, and other stakeholders. In sum, a standard is
   emerging for research that is both rigorous and relevant. Consistent and
   bold application will increase the value, timeliness, and applicability
   of the research enterprise.

AB In psychology, outliers are often excluded before running an independent

   scores based on tests and questionnaires. This article concerns the
   handling of outliers in the context of independent samples t tests
   applied to nonnormal sum scores. After reviewing common practice, we
   present results of simulations of artificial and actual psychological
   data, which show that the removal of outliers based on commonly used Z
   value thresholds severely increases the Type I error rate. We found Type
   I error rates of above 20% after removing outliers with a threshold
   value of Z = 2 in a short and difficult test. Inflations of Type I error
   rates are particularly severe when researchers are given the freedom to
   alter threshold values of Z after having seen the effects thereof on
   outcomes. We recommend the use of nonparametric Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon
   tests or robust Yuen-Welch tests without removing outliers. These
   alternatives to independent samples t tests are found to have nominal
   Type I error rates with a minimal loss of power when no outliers are
   present in the data and to have nominal Type I error rates and good
   power when outliers are present.

   coordinated networks of institutions and communities focused on
   sustainable and adaptive management of natural resources. IIM enables
   simultaneous and cost-effective achievement of ecosystem-based
   management, climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction while
   conserving biodiversity, maintaining ecosystem services and securing
   human health and well-being. We present ten guiding principles for IIM,
   and then use these to evaluate 36 case studies from the Pacific islands.
   Most case studies were pilot or demonstration projects with little
   evidence of planning to ensure long-term financial and human capacity
   needs were sustained, beyond the life of the projects, or could be
   replicated at significant scales. Management outcomes in the Pacific
   will be enhanced by: (1) building on foundations of customary management
   practice and social networks; (2) working holistically across relevant
   ecological and governance scales, through coordinated but decentralized
   and nested institutions; (3) empowering local communities to participate
   in integrated planning and implementation; and (4) embedding IIM
   practice into national systems for long-term sustainability and
   replication. These also ultimately depend on the context and
   externalities, beyond the control of practitioners. Cost-effectiveness
   and appropriateness are also critical for successful IIM in the Pacific
   islands but ultimately there is little alternative for effective
   biodiversity conservation.

AB The moss bag technique is a simple and economical environmental
   monitoring tool used to monitor air quality. However, routine use of the
   method is not possible because the protocols involved have not yet been
   standardized. Some of the most variable methodological aspects include
   (i) selection of moss species, (ii) ratio of moss weight to surface area
   of the bag, (iii) duration of exposure, and (iv) height of exposure. In
   the present study, the best option for each of these aspects was
   selected on the basis of the mean concentrations and data replicability
   of Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb and Zn measured during at least two exposure periods
   in environments affected by different degrees of contamination. The
   optimal choices for the studied aspects were the following: (i) Sphagnum
   denticulatum, (ii) 5.68 mg of moss tissue for each cm(-2) of bag
   surface, (iii) 8 weeks of exposure, and (iv) 4 m height of exposure.
   Duration of exposure and height of exposure accounted for most of the
   variability in the data. The aim of this methodological study was to
   provide data to help establish a standardized protocol that will enable
   use of the moss bag technique by public authorities. (C) 2014 Elsevier

AB Here I outline some of what science can tell us about the problems in
   psychological publishing and how to best address those problems. First,
   the motivation behind questionable research practices is examined (the
   desire to get ahead or, at least, not fall behind). Next, behavior
   modification strategies are discussed, pointing out that reward works
   better than punishment. Humans are utility seekers and the
   implementation of current change initiatives is hindered by high initial
   buy-in costs and insufficient expected utility. Open science tools
   interested in improving science should team up, to increase utility
   while lowering the cost and risk associated with engagement. The best
   way to realign individual and group motives will probably be to create
   one, centralized, easy to use, platform, with a profile, a feed of
   targeted science stories based upon previous system interaction, a
   sophisticated (public) discussion section, and impact metrics which use
   the associated data These measures encourage high quality review and
   other prosocial activities while inhibiting self-serving behavior. Some
   advantages of centrally digitizing communications are outlined,
   including ways the data could be used to improve the peer review
   process. Most generally, it seems that decisions about change design and
   implementation should be theory and data driven.

AB Effective management of contaminated sediments is important for
   long-term human and environmental health, but site-management decisions
   are often made under high uncertainty and without the help of structured
   decision support tools. Potential trade-offs between remedial costs,
   environmental effects, human health risks, and societal benefits, as
   well as fundamental differences in stakeholder priorities, complicate
   decision making. Formal decision-analytic tools such as multicriteria
   decision analysis (MCDA) move beyond ad hoc decision support to
   quantitatively and holistically rank management alternatives and add
   transparency and replicability to the evaluation process. However, even
   the best decisions made under uncertainty may be found suboptimal in
   hindsight, once additional scientific, social, economic, or other
   details become known. Value of information (VoI) analysis extends MCDA
   by systematically evaluating the impact of uncertainty on a decision.
   VoI prioritizes future research in terms of expected decision relevance
   by helping decision makers estimate the likelihood that additional
   information will improve decision confidence or change their selection
   of a management plan. In this study, VoI analysis evaluates uncertainty,
   estimates decision confidence, and prioritizes research to inform
   selection of a sediment capping strategy for the dibenzo-p-dioxin and
   -furan contaminated Grenland fiord system in southern Norway. The VoI
   model extends stochastic MCDA to model decisions with and without
   simulated new information and compares decision confidence across
   scenarios with different degrees of remaining uncertainty. Results
   highlight opportunities for decision makers to benefit from additional
   information by anticipating the improved decision confidence (or lack
   thereof) expected from reducing uncertainties for each criterion or
   combination of criteria. This case study demonstrates the usefulness of
   VoI analysis for environmental decisions by predicting when decisions
   can be made confidently, for prioritizing areas of research to pursue to
   improve decision confidence, and for differentiating between
   decision-relevant and decision-irrelevant differences in evaluation
   perspectives, all of which help guide meaningful deliberation toward
   effective consensus solutions.

AB Background: The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is a widely
   used screening tool for postpartum depression (PPD). Although the
   reliability and validity of EPDS in Japanese has been confirmed and the
   prevalence of PPD is found to be about the same as Western countries,
   the factor structure of the Japanese version of EPDS has not been
   elucidated yet.
   Methods: 690 Japanese mothers completed all items of the EPDS at 1 month
   postpartum. We divided them randomly into two sample sets. The first
   sample set (n = 345) was used for exploratory factor analysis, and the
   second sample set was used (n = 345) for confirmatory factor analysis.
   Results: The result of exploratory factor analysis indicated a
   three-factor model consisting of anxiety, depression and anhedonia. The
   results of confirmatory factor analysis suggested that the anxiety and
   anhedonia factors existed for EPDS in a sample of Japanese women at 1
   month postpartum. The depression factor varies by the models of
   acceptable fit.
   Conclusions: We examined EPDS scores. As a result, "anxiety" and
   "anhedonia" exist for EPDS among postpartum women in Japan as already
   reported in Western countries. Cross-cultural research is needed for
   future research.

AB In response to what has been termed the "replicability crisis," great
   changes are currently under way in how science is conducted and
   disseminated. A question therefore arises over how such change impacts
   law's treatment of scientific evidence. The present standard for the
   admissibility of scientific evidence in federal courts in the U.S. asks
   judges to play the role of gatekeeper, determining if the proffered
   evidence conforms with several indicia of scientific validity. The
   replicability crisis, however, has demonstrated that these indicia
   frequently fail to adequately capture, or have lagged behind, science's
   best practices. Therefore, this article suggests that as much as the
   replicability crisis highlights serious issues in the scientific
   process, it should have similar implications and actionable consequences
   for legal practitioners and academics. The Article concludes with some
   suggestions to help ensure that legal decisions are influenced by the
   best science has to offer.

   translated from English into Portuguese using the forward-backward
   translation method and administered to a sample of 551 Portuguese
   workers. Exploratory factor analyses were conducted to test the
   replicability of the scale. The results confirmed the expected
   two-factor structure: harmonious passion and obsessive passion. However,
   the initial criterion of the replication of the factorial structure
   based on item factor loadings was not fulfilled. Criterion-related
   validity was tested by correlations with passion and job satisfaction.
   Regarding internal consistency, adequate alpha coefficients were
   obtained for both factors.

   analyzed the complete publication history of the current top 100
   education journals ranked by 5-year impact factor and found that only

   findings in medicine, but similar to psychology, the majority of
   education replications successfully replicated the original studies.
   However, replications were significantly less likely to be successful
   when there was no overlap in authorship between the original and
   replicating articles. The results emphasize the importance of
   third-party, direct replications in helping education research improve
   its ability to shape education policy and practice.

   imitation females were set out under light polluted and control
   conditions at varying light pollution intensities in an undisturbed

   to interfere with phototaxis: no males were attracted at either 0.3 or
   0.18 lux background lighting versus 33 males collected at paired dark
   controls. These background illumination levels are much lower than that
   of 1.5 lux which is recommended by local city councils in Britain to
   light footpaths. A survey of female L. noctiluca numbers and
   distribution showed a trend towards female clumping that was not

AB Replication attempts are essential to the empirical sciences. Successful
   replication attempts increase researchers' confidence in the presence of
   an effect, whereas failed replication attempts induce skepticism and
   doubt. However, it is often unclear to what extent a replication attempt
   results in success or failure. To quantify replication outcomes we
   propose a novel Bayesian replication test that compares the adequacy of
   2 competing hypotheses. The 1st hypothesis is that of the skeptic and
   holds that the effect is spurious; this is the null hypothesis that
   postulates a zero effect size, H-0 : delta=0. The 2nd hypothesis is that
   of the proponent and holds that the effect is consistent with the one
   found in the original study, an effect that can be quantified by a
   posterior distribution. Hence, the 2nd hypothesis-the replication
   hypothesis-is given by H-r : delta similar to "posterior distribution
   from original study." The weighted-likelihood ratio between H-0 and H-r
   quantifies the evidence that the data provide for replication success
   and failure. In addition to the new test, we present several other
   Bayesian tests that address different but related questions concerning a
   replication study. These tests pertain to the independent conclusions of
   the separate experiments, the difference in effect size between the
   original experiment and the replication attempt, and the overall
   conclusion based on the pooled results. Together, this suite of Bayesian
   tests allows a relatively complete formalization of the way in which the
   result of a replication attempt alters our knowledge of the phenomenon
   at hand. The use of all Bayesian replication tests is illustrated with 3
   examples from the literature. For experiments analyzed using the t test,
   computation of the new replication test only requires the t values and
   the numbers of participants from the original study and the replication
   study.

   processing is altered in AD. The aim of this study was to investigate
   agreement and reliability of 3 pain sensitivity tests and to examine
   pain threshold and tolerance in patients with AD. We examined 29
   patients with mild to moderate AD and 29 age- and gender-matched healthy
   control subjects with quantitative sensory testing, ie, assessments of
   detection threshold (warmth detection threshold [WDT1) and pain
   threshold (heat pain threshold [HPT], pressure algometry, cold pressor
   test), and assessments of tolerance (pressure algometry, cold pressor
   test). All procedures were done twice on day 1, 1 hour apart, and
   repeated on day 2. We found no difference between groups for WDT
   (patient vs control subjects: mean [95% confidence interval]: 35.5
   degrees C [33.4 degrees C to 37.6 degrees C] vs 35.4 degrees C [34.3
   degrees C to 36.5 degrees C], P=.8) or HPT (41.2 degrees C [40.0 degrees
   C to 42.4 degrees C] vs 423 degrees C [41.1 degrees C to 43.5 degrees
   C], P=.24). We observed comparable thresholds for pressure algometry
   (median [25% to 75% interquartile range]: 120 kPa [100 to 142 kPa] vs
   131 kPa [113 to 192 kPa], P=.10), but significantly lower tolerance in
   AD patients (213 kPa [188 to 306 kPa] vs 289 kPa [262 to 360 kPa],
   P=.008). No differences were found for the cold pressor test. The study
   demonstrated good replicability of the sensory testing data with
   comparable data variability, for both groups, which supports the use of
   these methods in studies of patients with mild to moderate AD. Contrary
   to previous studies, we observed a reduced pain tolerance in patients
   with mild to moderate AD, which suggests that the reduced report of pain
   cannot be explained by reduced processing of painful stimuli. (C) 2014

   undercontrolled (U), and overcontrolled (O) types. In this study, we
   examined the cross-cultural replicability of the RUO types in Italy,
   Poland, Spain, and the United States. Personality types were identified
   using cluster analyses of Big Five profiles in large samples of college
   students from Italy (n = 322), the United States (n = 499), Spain (n =
   420), and Poland (n = 235). Prior to clustering the profiles, the
   measurement invariance of the Big Five measure across samples was
   tested. We found evidence for the RUO types in all four samples. The
   three-cluster solution showed a better fit over alternative solutions
   and had a relatively high degree of cross-cultural generalizability. The
   RUO types are evident in samples from four countries with distinct
   linguistic and cultural traditions. Results were discussed in light of
   the importance of considering how traits are organized within
   individuals for advancing contemporary personality psychology.

AB Background: The removal of outliers to acquire a significant result is a
   questionable research practice that appears to be commonly used in
   psychology. In this study, we investigated whether the removal of
   outliers in psychology papers is related to weaker evidence (against the
   null hypothesis of no effect), a higher prevalence of reporting errors,
   and smaller sample sizes in these papers compared to papers in the same
   journals that did not report the exclusion of outliers from the
   analyses.
   Methods and Findings: We retrieved a total of 2667 statistical results
   of null hypothesis significance tests from 153 articles in main
   psychology journals, and compared results from articles in which
   outliers were removed (N = 92) with results from articles that reported
   no exclusion of outliers (N = 61). We preregistered our hypotheses and
   methods and analyzed the data at the level of articles. Results show no
   significant difference between the two types of articles in median p
   value, sample sizes, or prevalence of all reporting errors, large
   reporting errors, and reporting errors that concerned the statistical
   significance. However, we did find a discrepancy between the reported
   degrees of freedom of t tests and the reported sample size in 41% of
   articles that did not report removal of any data values. This suggests
   common failure to report data exclusions (or missingness) in
   psychological articles.
   Conclusions: We failed to find that the removal of outliers from the
   analysis in psychological articles was related to weaker evidence
   (against the null hypothesis of no effect), sample size, or the
   prevalence of errors. However, our control sample might be contaminated
   due to nondisclosure of excluded values in articles that did not report
   exclusion of outliers. Results therefore highlight the importance of
   more transparent reporting of statistical analyses.

AB The reproducibility of the electrical characteristics of molecular
   junctions has been notoriously low. This paper describes a method to
   construct tunnel junctions based on self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) by
   forming reversible electrical contacts to SAMs using top-electrodes of a
   non-Newtonian liquid-metal (GaOx/EGaIn) stabilized in a
   microfluidic-based device. A single top-electrode can be used to form up
   to 15-25 junctions. This method generates SAM-based junctions with
   highly reproducible electrical characteristics in terms of precision
   (widths of distributions) and replicability (closeness to a reference
   value). The reason is that this method, unlike other approaches that
   rely on cross-bar or nano/micropore configurations, does not require
   patterning of the bottom-electrodes and is compatible with ultra-flat
   template-stripped (TS) surfaces. This compatibly with non-patterned
   electrodes is important for three reasons. i) No edges of the electrodes
   are present at which SAMs cannot pack well. ii) Patterning requires
   photoresist that may contaminate the electrode and complicate SAM
   formation. iii) TS-surfaces contain large grains, have low rms values,
   and can be obtained and used (in ordinary laboratory conditions) within
   a few seconds to minimize contamination. The junctions have very good
   electrical stability (2500 current-voltage cycles and retained currents
   for 27 h), and can be fabricated with good yields (approximate to 78%).

AB The abuse of prescription opioids imposes a substantial public health
   and economic burden. Recent research using administrative claims data
   has substantiated the prevalence and cost of opioid abuse among
   commercially insured individuals. Although administrative claims data
   are readily available and have been used to effectively answer research
   questions about the burden of illness for many different conditions, an
   important issue is the reliability, replicability, and generalizability
   of estimates derived from different databases. Therefore, this study
   sought to assess whether the findings of a recently published study of
   opioid abuse in a commercial claims database (original analysis) could
   be replicated in a different commercial claims database. The original
   analysis, which analyzed the prevalence and excess health care costs of
   diagnosed opioid abuse in the OptumHealth Reporting and Insights
   Database, was replicated by applying the same approach to the Truven
   MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database (replication
   analysis). In the replication analysis, the prevalence of diagnosed
   opioid abuse increased steadily from 15.8 diagnosed opioid abusers per
   10 000 in 2009, to 26.6 diagnosed opioid abusers per 10 000 in 2012.
   Although the prevalence of diagnosed opioid abuse was higher than
   reported in the original analysis, the trend of increasing prevalence
   over time was consistent across analyses. Additionally, diagnosed
   abusers had excess annual per patient health care costs of $ 11 376 in
   the replication analysis, which was consistent with the excess annual
   per patient health care costs of diagnosed abuse of $ 10 627 reported in
   the original analysis. The replication analysis also found an upward
   trend in the prevalence of diagnosed opioid abuse over time and
   substantial excess annual per patient health care costs of diagnosed
   opioid abuse among commercially insured individuals, suggesting that
   these findings are generalizable to other commercially insured
   populations.

AB Issues of publication bias, lack of replicability, and false discovery
   have long plagued the genetics community. Proper utilization of public
   and shared data resources presents an opportunity to ameliorate these
   problems. We present an approach to public database management that we
   term Quality Preserving Database (QPD). It enables perpetual use of the
   database for testing statistical hypotheses while controlling false
   discovery and avoiding publication bias on the one hand, and maintaining
   testing power on the other hand. We demonstrate it on a use case of a
   replication server for GWAS findings, underlining its practical utility.
   We argue that a shift to using QPD in managing current and future
   biological databases will significantly enhance the community's ability
   to make efficient and statistically sound use of the available data

AB Sedentary lifestyle is associated with cardiovascular and metabolic
   diseases. A compelling body of evidence demonstrates the amelioration
   and prevention of such conditions with increased levels of physical
   activity (PA). Despite this evidence, many public health initiatives
   aimed at increasing PA have failed to demonstrate clinically relevant
   effects on public health. It has been hypothesized that the highly
   controlled environments in which PA and health research is conducted
   limits its replicability in real-world community settings. This review
   aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of community fitness center-based
   interventions on inactivity-related diseases in adults. Data from 11
   investigations highlighted 3 factors: 1) a lack of community-based PA
   studies, 2) a lack of clinically relevant data, and 3) further reliance
   on self-report and rudimentary measurements. It is concluded that the
   current laboratory-based evidence for PA and health is to be replicated
   yet in real-world settings and that rigorous and clinically relevant
   naturalistic research is required.

AB The present study deals with an important problem that currently affects
   scientists and society, namely, the falsification and manipulation of
   research and researchers' CVs, which has considerably increased in
   recent years. This is shown by some studies, the authors of which have
   found high percentages of researchers who falsify their CV or manipulate
   data. We analyze the system used to evaluate science and researchers,
   which is almost exclusively based on the impact factor. We review the
   main critiques on the inappropriate use of the impact factor to assess
   researchers and argue that this has generated a new style of thinking in
   which the only goal is to obtain publications with an impact factor.
   Over the last few years, the pressure to publish has led to an obsession
   among researchers to disseminate the multiple indicators of their
   scientific publications over the Internet, to the extent that such
   initiatives look like marketing campaigns where researchers advertise
   themselves. For all these reasons, we propose that this may be a new
   psychological disorder, given that several criteria indicating
   maladaptation are clearly met: falsification and/or manipulation of
   data, falsification of publication indicators, distortion of reality,
   belief in manipulated data, and an obsession to conduct marketing
   campaigns of oneself. We address the important ethical and legal
   implications of such falsifications. Finally, we discuss the need to
   change the system used to evaluate science and researchers, which
   undoubtedly promotes these dishonest behaviors or this psychological
   dysfunction. (C) 2014 Colegio Oficial de Psicologos de Madrid.

AB BackgroundThere is general agreement that facial activity during pain
   conveys pain-specific information but is nevertheless characterized by
   substantial inter-individual differences. With the present study we aim
   to investigate whether these differences represent idiosyncratic
   variations or whether they can be clustered into distinct facial
   activity patterns.
   MethodsFacial actions during heat pain were assessed in two samples of
   pain-free individuals (n=128; n=112) and were later analysed using the
   Facial Action Coding System. Hierarchical cluster analyses were used to
   look for combinations of single facial actions in episodes of pain. The
   stability/replicability of facial activity patterns was determined
   across samples as well as across different basic social situations.
   ResultsCluster analyses revealed four distinct activity patterns during
   pain, which stably occurred across samples and situations: (I) narrowed
   eyes with furrowed brows and wrinkled nose; (II) opened mouth with
   narrowed eyes; (III) raised eyebrows; and (IV) furrowed brows with
   narrowed eyes. In addition, a considerable number of participants were
   facially completely unresponsive during pain induction (stoic cluster).
   These activity patterns seem to be reaction stereotypies in the majority
   of individuals (in nearly two-thirds), whereas a minority displayed
   varying clusters across situations.
   ConclusionThese findings suggest that there is no uniform set of facial
   actions but instead there are at least four different facial activity
   patterns occurring during pain that are composed of different
   configurations of facial actions. Raising awareness about these
   different faces of pain' might hold the potential of improving the
   detection and, thereby, the communication of pain.

AB We present MBIS (Multivariate Bayesian Image Segmentation tool), a
   clustering tool based on the mixture of multivariate normal
   distributions model. MBIS supports multichannel bias field correction
   based on a B-spline model. A second methodological novelty is the
   inclusion of graph-cuts optimization for the stationary anisotropic
   hidden Markov random field model. Along with MBIS, we release an
   evaluation framework that contains three different experiments on
   multi-site data. We first validate the accuracy of segmentation and the
   estimated bias field for each channel. MBIS outperforms a widely used
   segmentation tool in a cross-comparison evaluation. The second
   experiment demonstrates the robustness of results on atlas-free
   segmentation of two image sets from scan-rescan protocols on 21 healthy
   subjects. Multivariate segmentation is more replicable than the
   monospectral counterpart on T1-weighted images. Finally, we provide a
   third experiment to illustrate how MBIS can be used in a large-scale
   study of tissue volume change with increasing age in 584 healthy
   subjects. This last result is meaningful as multivariate segmentation
   performs robustly without the need for prior knowledge. (C) 2014

AB Background: Parental use of love withdrawal is thought to affect
   children's later psychological functioning because it creates a link
   between children's performance and relational consequences. In addition,
   recent studies have begun to show that experiences of love withdrawal
   also relate to the neural processing of socio-emotional information
   relevant to a performance-relational consequence link, and can moderate
   effects of oxytocin on social information processing and behavior. The
   current study follows-up on our previous results by attempting to
   confirm and extend previous findings indicating that experiences of
   maternal love withdrawal are related to electrocortical responses to
   emotional faces presented with performance feedback.
   Results: More maternal love withdrawal was related to enhanced early
   processing of facial feedback stimuli (reflected in more positive VPP
   amplitudes, and confirming previous findings). However, attentional
   engagement with and processing of the stimuli at a later stage were
   diminished in those reporting higher maternal love withdrawal (reflected
   in less positive LPP amplitudes, and diverging from previous findings).
   Conclusions: Maternal love withdrawal affects the processing of
   emotional faces presented with performance feedback differently in
   different stages of neural processing.

AB Over the past several years, two largely separate traditions have
   collided, leading to controversy over claims about priming. We describe
   and contrast the main accounts of priming effects in cognitive and
   social psychology, focusing especially on the role of awareness. In so
   doing, we consider one of the core points of contention: claims about
   the effects of subliminal priming. Whereas cognitive psychologists often
   are interested in exploring how priming operates with and without
   awareness, social psychologists more commonly assume subliminality in
   order to bolster claims about the automaticity of priming. We discuss
   the criteria necessary to claim that a stimulus was processed entirely
   without awareness, noting the challenges in meeting those criteria.
   Finally, we identify three sources of conflict between the fields:
   awareness, replicability, and the nature of the underlying processes. We
   close by proposing resolutions for each of them.

AB Subtle primes can influence behavior, often in ways that seem

   judgments can be influenced by anchors even when the anchors are known
   to be irrelevant and uninformative. In this article, we selectively
   examine the anchoring literature in order to evaluate a theoretical
   framework which has been employed to interpret many social and other
   priming effects. In this framework, primes are assumed to have broad
   effects, influencing a wide range of possible downstream behaviors, and
   these influences are largely automatic. The anchoring literature
   supports neither of these hypotheses. Anchors have narrow effects on
   behavior with little transfer across judgments, these effects can be
   controlled, and deliberate engagement with the anchor is a prerequisite
   for obtaining influences on later judgments. We question whether priming
   studies reveal evidence for the sort of automatic and consequential
   mental processes that are commonly proposed.

PD JUN 2014

AB In this article, we argue that whether or not a replication attempt is
   informative is dependent on the accuracy of one's underlying model to
   explain the effect, as it is the explanatory model that enumerates the
   contingencies necessary for producing the effect. If the model is
   incorrect, then a researcher may unknowingly change variables that the
   model says are irrelevant but which are really essential, rendering the
   replication results ambiguous. The expectation that effects of priming
   on social behavior should be widely invariant makes sense only under the
   assumptions of strict direct expression and spreading activation models,
   yet it has been shown that these models cannot adequately explain
   findings from the priming literature. We describe one model of priming
   that predicts variability across experimental contexts and populations:
   the resource computation model. We highlight variables that have been
   uncovered under the assumptions of this model that cannot be accounted
   for by direct expression models and which can explain replication
   failures. The model is also consistent with evolutionary understandings
   of the mind, in which information from multiple sources beyond just
   stimulus information is incorporated into behavioral decisions. To the
   degree that anything other than a strict, direct expression, spreading
   activation model is correct, the expectation that priming of social
   behaviors should be widely invariant is unreasonable.

   This perspective organizes a range of moderators identified in previous

AB Evidence of stable standard setting results over panels or occasions is
   an important part of the validity argument for an established cut score.
   Unfortunately, due to the high cost of convening multiple panels of
   content experts, standards often are based on the recommendation from a
   single panel of judges. This approach implicitly assumes that the
   variability across panels will be modest, but little evidence is
   available to support this assertion. This article examines the stability
   of Angoff standard setting results across panels. Data were collected
   for six independent standard setting exercises, with three panels
   participating in each exercise. The results show that although in some
   cases the panel effect is negligible, for four of the six data sets the
   panel facet represented a large portion of the overall error variance.
   Ignoring the often hidden panel/occasion facet can result in
   artificially optimistic estimates of the cut score stability. Results
   based on a single panel should not be viewed as a reasonable estimate of
   the results that would be found over multiple panels. Instead, the
   variability seen in a single panel can best be viewed as a lower bound
   of the expected variability when the exercise is replicated.

AB Moral Foundations Theory posits five distinct foundations of morality:
   Harm/Care, Fairness/Reciprocity, In-group/Loyalty, Authority/Respect,
   and Purity/Sanctity. In combination, this should yield between
   four-to-six moral signatures-distinct combinations or patterns of
   support for these aspects of morality. We extend previous research by
   examining the replicability of these moral signatures in a New
   Zealand-based national sample (n = 3,635). Latent Profile Analysis
   identified four distinct moral signatures: Individuators, Moderates,
   Neutrals, and High Moralists. We integrate these moral signatures within
   the Dual Process Model (DPM) framework and show that Social Dominance
   Orientation predicts membership in the Neutral moral signature
   (moderate/lukewarm support for multiple moral foundations); whereas
   Right-Wing Authoritarianism predicts membership in the High Moralist
   signature (undifferentiated high support across moral foundations).
   These findings were observed controlling for Big-Six personality and
   various demographics. Thus, the authoritarian and dominance-based
   motives identified by the DPM independently predict categorical
   differences in the signatures people use to judge morality.

   recalling and writing about a big, meaningful secret judged a pictured
   hill as steeper than did those who recalled and wrote about a small,
   inconsequential secret (with estimates unrelated to physical effort
   unaffected). From an embodied cognition perspective, this result was
   interpreted as suggesting that important secrets weigh people down.
   Answering to mounting calls for the crucial need of independent direct
   replications of published findings to ensure the self-correcting nature
   of our science, we sought to corroborate Slepian et al.'s finding in two
   extremely high-powered, preregistered studies that were very faithful to
   all procedural and methodological details of the original study (i.e.,
   same cover story, study title, manipulation, measures, item order, scale
   anchors, task instructions, sampling frame, population, and statistical
   analyses). In both samples, we were unsuccessful in replicating the
   target finding. Although Slepian et al. reported three other studies
   supporting the secret burdensomeness phenomenon, we advise that these
   three other findings need to be independently corroborated before the
   general phenomenon informs theory or health interventions.

AB Performance of indigenous culture at culture parks for tourism is
   traditionally viewed from a modernist ontological perspective as
   exploitative and from a managerial perspective as the provision of a
   service. These views might fail to accommodate the performers'
   subjectivities. In this Q method study the views of the performers are
   identified based on a sample of 30 respondents and 42 Q sort items.
   Respondents were performers employed at the Indigenous Peoples Culture
   Park in Taiwan. The replicability of a previous Q study was tested using
   the same design in a different research setting. In both studies two
   clusters of subjectivity were found: the 'Performers' View' and the
   'Instructors' View'. Neither view conforms to the modernist or
   managerial perspective identified in tourism research. Instead, the
   reflexivity of Q suggests that in the performance of indigenous culture,
   these fixed ontological categories are porous and situational. (C) 2014

AB Recently, researchers claimed that people are intuitively inclined to
   cooperate with reflection causing them to behave selfishly. Empirical
   support for this claim came from experiments using a 4-player public
   goods game with a marginal return of 0.5 showing that people contributed
   more money to a common project when they had to decide quickly (i.e., a
   decision based on intuition) than when they were instructed to reflect
   and decide slowly. This intuitive-cooperation effect is of high
   scientific and practical importance because it argues against a central
   assumption of traditional economic and evolutionary models. The first
   experiment of present study was set up to examine the generality of the
   intuitive-cooperation effect and to further validate the experimental
   task producing the effect. In Experiment 1, we investigated Amazon
   Mechanical Turk (AMT) workers' contributions to a 4-player public goods
   game with a marginal return of 0.5 while we manipulated the knowledge
   about the other players' contribution to the public goods game
   (contribution known vs. contribution unknown), the identity of the other
   players (humans vs. computers randomly generating contributions) and the
   time constraint (time pressure/intuition vs. forced delay/reflection).
   However, the results of Experiment 1 failed to reveal an
   intuitive-cooperation effect. Furthermore, four subsequent direct
   replications attempts with AMT workers (Experiments 2a, 2b, 2c and
   Experiment 3, which was conducted with naive/inexperienced participants)
   also failed to demonstrate intuitive-cooperation effects. Taken
   together, the results of the present study could not corroborate the
   idea that people are intuitively cooperative, hence suggesting that the
   theoretical relationship between intuition and cooperation should be
   further scrutinized.

   systematic review approach is used evaluate the project performance of
   18 adaptation projects by three of the Global Environment Facility's
   (GEF) adaptation programmes (the Strategic Priority for Adaptation
   (SPA), the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF), and the National
   Adaptation Programs of Action (NAPA)) according to effectiveness,
   efficiency, equity, legitimacy, flexibility, sustainability, and
   replicability. The ten SPA projects reviewed performed highest overall,
   especially with regards to efficiency, legitimacy, and replicability.
   The five SCCF projects performed the highest in equity, flexibility, and
   sustainability, and the three NAPA-related projects were the
   highest-performing projects with regards to effectiveness. A comparison
   of top-down and bottom-up approaches revealed that community stakeholder
   engagement in project design and implementation led to higher
   effectiveness, efficiency, equity, flexibility, legitimacy,
   sustainability, and replicability. Although low institutional capacity
   constrained both project success and effective community participation,
   projects that hired international staff to assist in implementation
   experienced higher overall performance. These case studies also
   illustrate how participatory methods can fail to genuinely empower or
   involve communities in adaptation interventions in both top-down and
   bottom-up approaches. It is thus crucial to carefully consider
   stakeholder engagement strategies in adaptation interventions.Policy
   relevanceWhile adaptation is now firmly on the policy and research
   agenda, actual interventions to reduce vulnerability and enhance
   resilience remain in their infancy, and there is limited information on
   the factors that influence the successful implementation of adaptation
   in developing areas. Engaging stakeholders in assessing vulnerability
   and implementing adaptation interventions is widely regarded to be an
   important factor for adaptation implementation and success. However, no
   study has evaluated the effects of stakeholder engagement in the actual
   implementation of adaptation initiatives. Effective stakeholder
   engagement is challenging, especially in a developing nation setting,
   due to high levels of poverty, inadequate knowledge on adaptation
   options, weak institutions, and competing interests to address more
   immediate problems related to poverty and underdevelopment. In this
   context, this article documents and characterizes stakeholder engagement
   in adaptation interventions supported through the GEF, examining how
   top-down or bottom-up stakeholder approaches enable or constrain project
   performance.

AB Many mammalian species, as well as birds, are able to use a mirror
   either in the context of self-recognition, or instrumentally for
   discovering and manipulating objects that cannot be perceived directly.
   A noteworthy study by Broom et al. (2009) investigated the ability of
   pigs (Sus scrofa) to use a mirror to locate a hidden food source. The
   mirror-experienced pigs appeared to be able to bypass a solid barrier
   that blocked direct view of a food bowl when the food bowl could be seen
   via a mirror. We tried to replicate these findings using 2 groups of 11
   piglets each. The procedure used for testing the first group of 11 pigs
   followed Broom's description as closely as possible. Only two of the
   pigs of the first group were able to locate the hidden food bowl during
   the mirror test. Therefore, measures were taken to increase the number
   of pigs noticing the mirror in the second group of 11 pigs. Now,
   although pigs notice the mirror significantly earlier, only 1 of the
   mirror-experienced pigs and none of the mirror-naive pigs used the
   detour around the partition wall to reach the hidden food. We take this
   observation as evidence that the pigs did not understand what the mirror
   image represents, and did not use the mirror to locate food. This
   indicates that not all pigs are capable of using mirrors under all
   circumstances, and thus that mirror use may be at the upper limits of
   cognitive capacity of these animals at this age. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB Failures to replicate published psychological research findings have
   contributed to a "crisis of confidence." Several reasons for these
   failures have been proposed, the most notable being questionable
   research practices and data fraud. We examine replication from a
   different perspective and illustrate that current intuitive expectations
   for replication are unreasonable. We used computer simulations to create
   thousands of ideal replications, with the same participants, wherein the
   only difference across replications was random measurement error. In the
   first set of simulations, study results differed substantially across
   replications as a result of measurement error alone. This raises
   questions about how researchers should interpret failed replication
   attempts, given the large impact that even modest amounts of measurement
   error can have on observed associations. In the second set of
   simulations, we illustrated the difficulties that researchers face when
   trying to interpret and replicate a published finding. We also assessed
   the relative importance of both sampling error and measurement error in
   producing variability in replications. Conventionally, replication
   attempts are viewed through the lens of verifying or falsifying
   published findings. We suggest that this is a flawed perspective and
   that researchers should adjust their expectations concerning
   replications and shift to a meta-analytic mind-set.

AB An essential first step in planning a confirmatory or a replication
   study is to determine the sample size necessary to draw statistically
   reliable inferences using power analysis. A key problem, however, is
   that what is available is the sample-size estimate of the effect size,
   and its use can lead to severely underpowered studies when the effect
   size is overestimated. As a potential remedy, we introduce safeguard
   power analysis, which uses the uncertainty in the estimate of the effect
   size to achieve a better likelihood of correctly identifying the
   population effect size. Using a lower-bound estimate of the effect size,
   in turn, allows researchers to calculate a sample size for a replication
   study that helps protect it from being underpowered. We show that in
   most common instances, compared with nominal power, safeguard power is
   higher whereas standard power is lower. We additionally recommend the
   use of safeguard power analysis to evaluate the strength of the evidence
   provided by the original study.

AB The current crisis in scientific psychology about whether our findings
   are irreproducible was presaged years ago by Tversky and Kahneman
   (1971), who noted that even sophisticated researchers believe in the
   fallacious Law of Small Numbers-erroneous intuitions about how
   imprecisely sample data reflect population phenomena. Combined with the
   low power of most current work, this often leads to the use of
   misleading criteria about whether an effect has replicated. Rosenthal
   (1990) suggested more appropriate criteria, here labeled the
   continuously cumulating meta-analytic (CCMA) approach. For example, a
   CCMA analysis on a replication attempt that does not reach significance
   might nonetheless provide more, not less, evidence that the effect is
   real. Alternatively, measures of heterogeneity might show that two
   studies that differ in whether they are significant might have only
   trivially different effect sizes. We present a nontechnical introduction
   to the CCMA framework (referencing relevant software), and then explain
   how it can be used to address aspects of replicability or more generally
   to assess quantitative evidence from numerous studies. We then present
   some examples and simulation results using the CCMA approach that show
   how the combination of evidence can yield improved results over the
   consideration of single studies.

AB The FP7 Theseus research project (2009-2013) aims to develop and assess
   innovative technologies and methodologies for coastal protection against
   erosion, flooding and environmental damages. While protection structures
   may help to reduce the level of hazard and the expected degree of loss,
   some danger of technical failures or human errors will always remain.
   For extreme events, the implementation of non-structural measures as
   early warning systems and disaster management practices is required to
   ensure the protection of population.
   During Theseus, a methodology for helping the local authorities to
   prepare an action plan in case of coastal flooding was developed and
   tested on the estuary of Gironde in France. The methodology builds over
   the return of experience from past events and tries to clearly identify
   all the stages of an evacuation and the thinking process that can lead
   to a robust evacuation plan. It relies on a conceptual framework -
   SADT-which helps to understand how data should be processed from its
   collection to its use in the plan. The risk scenarios were calculated
   for current and future conditions of the XXIst century, taking into
   account the effects of climate change. The methodology is supported by
   the OSIRIS software, prototyped during the FP5 eponymous project and
   later distributed by CETMEF and the French basin authorities of Loire
   and Meuse.
   The methodology for the preparation of evacuation plans was applied on a
   pilot city of Theseus, Bordeaux on the estuary of Gironde (France), and
   the software used to calculate evacuation times was tried out on
   Cesenatico near the Adriatic coast (Italy). This comparison verified the
   replicability of methodological guidelines in two different European
   contexts. The cultural and organizational differences and the different
   number of people involved underlined strong questions to be addressed
   when applying them. In order to assess the efficiency of an evacuation
   strategy and to compute the number of people successfully evacuated over
   time, a macroscopic model (not representing each individual vehicle but
   only flows of vehicles in congestion points) for the simulation of
   traffic congestion was used, based on the work of the University of
   Twente, Rijkswaterstaat and INFRAM. This model will be integrated in the
   Theseus decision support system for helping coastal managers to select
   their strategy for risk mitigation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Nearly all American states use one of two systems for setting the amount
   of child support that noncustodial parents (NCPs) are required to pay to
   custodial parents (CPs). In previous work, we found that lay judgments
   of the child support amount the law should require differ in meaningful
   ways from these two systems: Our respondents favored child support
   amounts that are more responsive to the NCP's income and much more
   responsive to the CP's income than set by either system. They also
   favored dollar amounts that increase more rapidly with NCP income when
   CP income is lower, producing a characteristic fanning lines pattern
   when dollar support amounts are charted against NCP income for several
   different CP incomes. We give the label "Fair Shares" to these two
   features of our respondents' child support judgments. We describe six
   new experimental studies that vary the context of these judgments in
   ways that test whether the "Fair Shares" account is robust. Our studies
   consistently replicate the fan-shaped pattern and shed further light on
   lay judgments.

AB Recent studies have indicated that research practices in psychology may
   be susceptible to factors that increase false-positive rates, raising
   concerns about the possible prevalence of false-positive findings. The
   present article discusses several practices that may run counter to the
   inflation of false-positive rates. Taking these practices into account
   would lead to a more balanced view on the false-positive issue.
   Specifically, we argue that an inflation of false-positive rates would
   diminish, sometimes to a substantial degree, when researchers (a) have
   explicit a priori theoretical hypotheses, (b) include multiple
   replication studies in a single paper, and (c) collect additional data
   based on observed results. We report findings from simulation studies
   and statistical evidence that support these arguments. Being aware of
   these preventive factors allows researchers not to overestimate the
   pervasiveness of false-positives in psychology and to gauge the
   susceptibility of a paper to possible false-positives in practical and
   fair ways.

   (n = 202) from several cultures in Israel (i.e., Israeli-born Jews
   [IBJs], Israeli-Russian immigrants, and Israeli-Arabs and Druze)
   listened to 40 pieces conveying five emotions (anger, fear, sadness,
   happiness, and serenity) and decoded their emotional content. The
   improvisations were performed by four IBJ musicians on four instruments
   (piano, darbuka, voice, and kazoo). No differences were found between
   the groups regarding four of the emotions and three of the instruments.
   However, IBJs were more accurate in identifying fear and emotions
   conveyed by kazoo. These findings demonstrate that people from different
   cultures within the same country have a similar ability to recognize
   emotions expressed through different musical instruments, with the
   exception of specific emotions and mediums. The results of this study
   also emphasize the potential of communication of emotions through
   musical intercultural encounters. Nevertheless, since the study was not
   based on a balanced factorial design, its findings should be interpreted
   with caution. Future studies that are based on an orthogonal study

AB Given the difficulty and effort required to confirm candidate causal

   practical way to definitively filter false positives. Recent advances in
   algorithmics and statistics have enabled repeated exhaustive search for
   bivariate features in a practical amount of time using standard
   computational resources, allowing us to use cross-validation to evaluate
   the stability. We performed 10 trials of 2-fold cross-validation of
   exhaustive bivariate analysis on seven Wellcome-Trust Case-Control
   Consortium GWAS datasets, comparing the traditional chi(2) test for
   association, the high-performance GBOOST method and the recently

   extension to Spearman's correlation. The extension allows us to consider
   a natural threshold for feature selection where the correlation is zero.
   This is the first reported cross-validation study of exhaustive
   bivariate GWAS feature selection. We found that stability between ranked
   lists from different cross-validation folds was higher for GSS in the
   majority of diseases. A thorough analysis of the correlation between
   SNP-frequency and univariate chi(2) score demonstrated that the chi(2)
   test for association is highly confounded by main effects: SNPs with
   high univariate significance replicably dominate the ranked results. We
   show that removal of the univariately significant SNPs improves chi(2)
   replicability but risks filtering pairs involving SNPs with univariate
   effects. We empirically confirm that the stability of GSS and GBOOST
   were not affected by removal of univariately significant SNPs. These
   results suggest that the GSS and GBOOST tests are successfully targeting
   bivariate association with phenotype and that GSS is able to reliably
   detect a larger set of SNP-pairs than GBOOST in the majority of the data
   we analysed. However, the chi(2) test for association was confounded by
   main effects.

AB Kroll and Bialystok assert that managing two languages leads to a
   reorganisation of the neural circuits involved in language and cognitive
   processing and to bilingual advantages in executive functioning. This
   commentary documents that bilingual advantages in inhibitory control,
   switching and monitoring are difficult to replicate. Kroll and Bialystok
   argue that the use of componential analyses and categorical
   hypothesising are often responsible for the null results and that these
   research practices have created a false controversy surrounding the
   existence of bilingual advantages. An alternative perspective is
   presented suggesting that the appearance of a steady stream of published
   reports has been exaggerated because of the frequent use of risky small
   n's, a confirmation bias to report positive findings and a reluctance to
   conduct and report exact replications.

AB Background The triarchic model of psychopathy characterizes the disorder
   in terms of three distinguishable phenotypic facets: disinhibition,
   meanness and boldness. The present study sought to (1) inform current
   debates regarding the role of boldness in the definition of psychopathy
   and (2) clarify boundaries between psychopathy and antisocial
   personality disorder (ASPD).
   Method This study evaluated the degree to which facets of the triarchic
   model are represented in the most widely used clinical inventory for
   psychopathy, the Psychopathy Checklist - Revised (PCL-R), in comparison
   with ASPD as defined by DSM-IV criteria. Adult male offenders from two
   distinct correctional settings (n=157 and 169) were investigated to
   ensure replicability of findings across samples exhibiting high base
   rates of psychopathy and antisocial behavior.
   Results We found evidence for convergent and discriminant validity of
   the three triarchic facets in predicting symptomatic components of
   psychopathy as assessed by the PCL-R. Additionally, and crucially
   vis-a-vis current debates in the field, we found that boldness
   contributed incrementally (over and above disinhibition and meanness) to
   prediction of PCL-R psychopathy, in particular its interpersonal style
   component, but not ASPD.
   Conclusions The three distinct facets of the triarchic model of
   psychopathy are represented clearly and distinctly in the PCL-R, with
   boldness through its interpersonal facet, but not in DSM-defined ASPD.
   Our findings suggest that boldness is central to diagnostic conceptions
   of psychopathy and distinguishes psychopathy from the more prevalent
   diagnosis of ASPD.

AB Network operators are increasingly competing with triple play offers
   from cable providers for both broadcast customers and telecommunications
   customers. In recent years they have invested in IPTV platforms and
   launched their own IPTV services. This has brought a new question on the
   regulatory agenda: shall network operators be obliged to offer wholesale
   access to their IPTV platform? And if yes, should the new wholesale IPTV
   product be regulated in the same way as traditional wholesale access? Or
   should traditional regulation be modified? While the majority of
   countries have so far no regulatory rules in place, some national
   regulators have started to become active in this market segment.
   In order for alternative network operators to realise multiple play
   offers including IPTV they must be able to match the offers of the
   incumbent operators. Such replicability with respect to telecoms
   infrastructure is in principle no problem as long as regulatory rules on
   local loop unbundling and related facilities are in place. But what if
   incumbent operators are neither required to offer unbundled access to
   their FTTH local loops nor do alternative network operators have access
   to sub-loop unbundling? It is for this reason that many argue some form
   of direct access to the incumbent multicast equipment needs to be
   provided. Otherwise the provision of IPTV services will be restricted to
   large network operators.
   The paper demonstrates that the regulation of wholesale access to IPTV
   depends above all on country specific conditions. Ex-ante regulation of
   access to wholesale broadband services over any DSL technology and any
   transport technology (ATM and Ethernet) in the sense that the SMP
   operator is obliged to offer a multicast functionality that allows
   competitors to offer TV services should be bound to a number of
   requirements: (1) the demand characteristics such as demand for bundled
   products. A precondition for determining regulatory obligations with
   respect to the provision of wholesale access to IPTV platforms should be
   that multiple play offers are the dominant form of providing telecom
   services. (2) The lack of cable TV operators exerting competitive
   pressure at the retail level for triple play products. (3) A lack of LLU
   in the country, so that alternative operators need a multicast WBA
   access to offer multiple play services.
   The paper is organised as follows. The first section of the paper
   briefly describes the technical and market characteristics of wholesale
   IPTV access. The second section considers the impact of IPTV wholesale
   access regulation on competition, investment and broadband diffusion.
   The third section examines regulatory issues concerning access to
   wholesale IPTV in more detail. The final section gives key
   recommendations for a regulatory strategy on wholesale broadband access
   to IPTV. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Scientists in many disciplines have begun to raise questions about the
   evolution of research findings over time (Ioannidis in Epidemiology, 19,
   640-648, 2008; Jennions & Moller in Proceedings of the Royal Society,
   Biological Sciences, 269, 43-48, 2002; Mullen, Muellerleile, & Bryan in
   Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 27, 1450-1462, 2001;
   Schooler in Nature, 470, 437, 2011), since many phenomena exhibit
   decline effects-reductions in the magnitudes of effect sizes as
   empirical evidence accumulates. The present article examines empirical
   and theoretical evolution in eyewitness identification research. For
   decades, the field has held that there are identification procedures
   that, if implemented by law enforcement, would increase eyewitness
   accuracy, either by reducing false identifications, with little or no
   change in correct identifications, or by increasing correct
   identifications, with little or no change in false identifications.
   Despite the durability of this no-cost view, it is unambiguously
   contradicted by data (Clark in Perspectives on Psychological Science, 7,
   238-259, 2012a; Clark & Godfrey in Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 16,
   22-42, 2009; Clark, Moreland, & Rush, 2013; Palmer & Brewer in Law and
   Human Behavior, 36, 247-255, 2012), raising questions as to how the
   no-cost view became well-accepted and endured for so long. Our analyses
   suggest that (1) seminal studies produced, or were interpreted as having
   produced, the no-cost pattern of results; (2) a compelling theory was
   developed that appeared to account for the no-cost pattern; (3)
   empirical results changed over the years, and subsequent studies did not
   reliably replicate the no-cost pattern; and (4) the no-cost view
   survived despite the accumulation of contradictory empirical evidence.
   Theories of memory that were ruled out by early data now appear to be
   supported by data, and the theory developed to account for early data
   now appears to be incorrect.

AB Six decades-worth of published information has shown irrefutably that
   null-hypothesis significance tests (NHSTs) provide no information about
   the reliability of research outcomes. Nevertheless, they are still the
   core of editorial decision-making in Psychology. Two reasons appear to
   contribute to the continuing practice. One, survey information suggests
   that a majority of psychological researchers incorrectly believe that p
   values provide information about reliability of results. Two, a position
   sometimes taken is that using them to make decisions has been
   essentially benign. The mistaken belief has been pointed out many times,
   so it is briefly covered because of the apparent persistence of the
   misunderstanding. The idea that NHSTs have been benign is challenged by
   seven "side-effects" that continue to retard effective development of
   psychological science. The article concludes with both a few suggestions
   about possible alternatives and a challenge to psychological researchers
   to develop new methods that actually assess the reliability of research
   findings.

AB Background
   Randomized trials of complex, non-pharmacologic interventions
   implemented in home and community settings, such as the University of
   Southern California (USC)-Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation
   Center (RLANRC) Pressure Ulcer Prevention Study (PUPS), present unique
   challenges with respect to (1) participant recruitment and retention,
   (2) intervention delivery and fidelity, (3) randomization and
   assessment, and (4) potential inadvertent treatment effects.
   Purpose
   We describe the methods employed to address the challenges confronted in
   implementing PUPS. In this randomized controlled trial, we are assessing
   the efficacy of a complex, preventive intervention in reducing the
   incidence of, and costs associated with, the development of medically
   serious pressure ulcers in people with spinal cord injury.
   Methods
   Individuals with spinal cord injury recruited from RLANRC were assigned
   to either a 12-month preventive intervention group or a standard care
   control group. The primary outcome is the incidence of serious pressure
   ulcers with secondary endpoints including ulcer-related surgeries,
   medical treatment costs, and quality of life. These outcomes are
   assessed at 12 and 24 months after randomization. Additionally, we are
   studying the mediating mechanisms that account for intervention
   outcomes.
   Results
   PUPS has been successfully implemented, including recruitment of the
   target sample size of 170 participants, assurance of the integrity of
   intervention protocol delivery with an average 90% treatment adherence
   rate, and enactment of the assessment plan. However, implementation has
   been replete with challenges. To meet recruitment goals, we instituted a
   five-pronged approach customized for an underserved, ethnically diverse
   population. In intervention delivery, we increased staff time to
   overcome economic and cultural barriers to retention and adherence. To
   ensure treatment fidelity and replicability, we monitored intervention
   protocol delivery in accordance with a rigorous plan. Finally, we have
   overcome unanticipated assessment and design concerns related to (1)
   determining pressure ulcer incidence/severity, (2) randomization
   imbalance, and (3) inadvertent potential control group contamination.
   Limitations
   We have addressed the most daunting challenges encountered in the
   recruitment, assessment, and intervention phases of PUPS. Some
   challenges and solutions may not apply to trials conducted in other
   settings.
   Conclusions
   Overcoming challenges has required a multifaceted approach incorporating
   individualization, flexibility, and persistence, as well as the ability
   to implement needed mid-course corrections.

AB Background: The current study evaluates the reliability and
   factor-structure replicability of the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis,
   Pisa, Paris and San Diego Autoquestionnaire (TEMPS-A) in its Greek
   Version.
   Methods: The TEMPS-A was administered to a convenient sample of 734
   subjects from the general Greek population (436 females; 594% and 298
   males; 40.6%). Their mean age was 40.80 +/- 11.48 years (range 25-67
   years). The analysis included the calculation of Chronbach's alpha, the
   calculation of the threshold to define dominant temperaments (+2
   standard deviations or 95th percentile), confirmatory factor analysis
   and the calculation of Pearson correlation coefficients between the
   temperament scales scores. Analysis of Covariance with age as covariate
   and post-hoc t-test was used to search for differences in temperament
   scores between males and females. Also a table of percentile values
   corresponding to a raw score was created.
   Results: Internal consistency was excellent for the various temperaments
   (0.72-0.88). The factor analysis confirmed the five factor solution as
   the best factor solution. All TEMPS items were included in the final
   version of the scale in the Greek language.
   Limitations: The study sample included subjects from the general
   population, but it is a convenient and not representative sample.
   Although the authors tried to select them on the basis of being mentally
   healthy and without a psychiatric history, there is always a degree of
   uncertainty. There is also always the possibility some of them to
   manifest a mental disorder in the future, thus being currently in a
   premorbid state.
   Conclusion: The Greek version of the TEMPS A, has good internal
   consistency and factor structure similar to what was found in other
   translations. Overall our results are in accord with the literature and
   in line with theoretical considerations as well as with empirical
   evidence. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved

AB Elucidating the fitness effects of natural genetic variants is one of
   the current major challenges in evolutionary biology. Understanding the
   interplay between genotype, phenotype and environment is necessary to
   make accurate predictions of important biological outcomes such as
   stress resistance or yield in economically important plants and animals,
   and disease in humans. Based on population frequency patterns and
   footprints of selection at the DNA level, the transposable element
   Bari-Jheh, inserted in the intergenic region of Juvenile Hormone Epoxy
   Hydrolase (Jheh) genes, was previously identified as putatively
   adaptive. However, the adaptive effect of this mutation remained
   elusive. In this work, we integrate information on transcription factor
   binding sites, available ChIP-Seq data, gene expression analyses and
   phenotypic assays to identify the functional and the mechanistic
   underpinnings of Bari-Jheh. We show that Bari-Jheh adds extra
   antioxidant response elements upstream of Jheh1 and Jheh2 genes.
   Accordingly, we find that Bari-Jheh is associated with upregulation of
   Jheh1 and Jheh2 and with resistance to oxidative stress induced by two
   different compounds relevant for natural D.melanogaster populations. We
   further show that TEs other than Bari-Jheh might be playing a role in
   the D.melanogaster response to oxidative stress. Overall our results
   contribute to the understanding of resistance to oxidative stress in
   natural populations and highlight the role of transposable elements in
   environmental adaptation. The replicability of fitness effects on
   different genetic backgrounds also suggests that epistatic interactions
   do not seem to dominate the genetic architecture of oxidative stress
   resistance.

AB Numerous experiments have been conducted in recent years on anomalous
   retroactive influences on cognition and affect (Bern, 2010), yet more
   data are needed to understand these processes precisely. For this
   purpose, we carried out an initial retro-priming study in which the
   response times of 162 participants were measured (Rabeyron and Watt,
   2010). In the current paper, we present the results of a second study in
   which we selected those participants who demonstrated the strongest
   retro-priming effect during the first study, in order to see if we could
   replicate this effect and therefore select high scoring participants. An
   additional objective was to try to find correlations between
   psychological characteristics (anomalous experiences, mental health,
   mental boundaries, trauma, negative life events) and retro-priming
   results for the high scoring participants. The retro-priming effect was
   also compared with performance on a classical priming task. Twenty-eight
   participants returned to the laboratory for this new study. The results,
   for the whole group, on the retro-priming task, were negative and
   non-significant (es = -0.25, ns) and the results were significant on the
   priming task (es = 0.63, p < 0.1). We obtained overall negative effects
   on retro-priming results for all the sub-groups (students, male,
   female). Ten participants were found to have positive results on the two
   retro-priming studies, but no specific psychological variables were
   found for these participants compared to the others. Several hypotheses
   are considered in explaining these results, and the author provide some
   final thoughts concerning psi and replicability.

AB Without a complete published description of interventions, clinicians
   and patients cannot reliably implement interventions that are shown to
   be useful, and other researchers cannot replicate or build on research
   findings. The quality of description of interventions in publications,
   however, is remarkably poor. To improve the completeness of reporting,
   and ultimately the replicability, of interventions, an international
   group of experts and stakeholders developed the Template for
   Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist and guide.
   The process involved a literature review for relevant checklists and
   research, a Delphi survey of an international panel of experts to guide
   item selection, and a face to face panel meeting. The resultant 12 item
   TIDieR checklist (brief name, why, what (materials), what (procedure),
   who provided, how, where, when and how much, tailoring, modifications,
   how well (planned), how well (actual)) is an extension of the CONSORT
   2010 statement (item 5) and the SPIRIT 2013 statement (item 11). While
   the emphasis of the checklist is on trials, the guidance is intended to
   apply across all evaluative study designs. This paper presents the
   TIDieR checklist and guide, with an explanation and elaboration for each
   item, and examples of good reporting. The TIDieR checklist and guide
   should improve the reporting of interventions and make it easier for
   authors to structure accounts of their interventions, reviewers and
   editors to assess the descriptions, and readers to use the information.

AB The paramount importance of replicating associations is well recognized
   in the genome-wide associaton (GWA) research community, yet methods for
   assessing replicability of associations are scarce. Published GWA
   studies often combine separately the results of primary studies and of
   the follow-up studies. Informally, reporting the two separate
   meta-analyses, that of the primary studies and follow-up studies, gives
   a sense of the replicability of the results. We suggest a formal
   empirical Bayes approach for discovering whether results have been
   replicated across studies, in which we estimate the optimal rejection
   region for discovering replicated results. We demonstrate, using
   realistic simulations, that the average false discovery proportion of
   our method remains small. We apply our method to six type two diabetes
   (T2D) GWA studies. Out of 803 SNPs discovered to be associated with T2D
   using a typical meta-analysis, we discovered 219 SNPs with replicated
   associations with T2D. We recommend complementing a meta-analysis with a
   replicability analysis for GWA studies.

AB Since the outbreak of the financial crisis in 2007, the level and
   volatility of the Euribor-OIS spreads have increased significantly.
   According to the literature, this variability is mainly explained by
   credit and liquidity risk premia. I provide evidence that part of the
   variability might also be explained by ambiguity in the phrasing of the
   Euribor survey. The participants in the survey are asked at what rate
   they believe interbank funds are exchanged between prime banks; given
   the lack of a clear definition of a prime bank, this question might
   leave room for subjective judgment. In particular, I find evidence that
   some of the variability of the Euribor rates might be explained by
   changes in the survey participants' perception of what a prime bank is.
   This evidence adds to the difficulties already encountered by previous
   studies in identifying and measuring exactly the determinants of the
   Euribor rates. I argue that these difficulties are at odds with the
   clarity, simplicity and replicability that should be required of a
   widely used financial benchmark.

AB Medial temporal lobe (MTL)/memory and frontal lobe (FL)/executive
   functions indexes are used to measure changes related to cognitive
   aging. These indexes are based on composite scores of neuropsychological
   tests validated in English-speaking populations, and their use in aging
   research is growing in popularity. This study aimed at validating the
   MTL/memory and FL/executive functions indexes in French-speaking adults.
   Ninety-eight healthy participants (32 young and 66 older adults) were
   tested on eight neuropsychological tests, three associated with
   MTL/memory functions and five associated with FL/executive functions.
   Factor analysis indicated that residual scores independent of age and
   associated with MTL/memory functions grouped under one factor, and
   residual scores associated with FL/executive functions grouped under
   another factor. Bootstrapping analysis with 1,000 resamples confirmed
   stability for seven neuropsychological tests. This study provides the
   first validation of the MTL/memory and FL/executive functions composite
   scores in French-speaking adults, which may be used to assess cognitive
   changes in aging research.

AB The adoptive transfer of natural regulatory T cells (nTreg) is a new
   option to reshape undesired immune reactivity in autoimmunity and
   transplantation toward tolerance. The first clinical trials using
   adoptive transfer of polyclonal nTreg demonstrated safety and hints of
   efficacy. However, the low frequencies of antigen-specific cells among
   the pool of polyclonal nTreg and their broad antigen nonspecific
   suppression are limitations of this approach regarding efficacy and
   safety. Recently, the isolation and expansion of (allo)antigen-specific
   nTreg have successfully been achieved by using Treg-specific activation
   markers but the yield is relatively low. Here, we describe a novel good
   manufacturing practice (GMP)-compatible expansion protocol of
   alloantigen-specific nTreg based on the stimulation of nTreg by
   allogeneic activated B cells. Their functionality and specificity are
   superior compared to polyclonal nTreg both in vitro and in vivo.
   Employing an allogeneic B cell bank, designed to cover the majority of
   HLA types, allows fast GMP-compliant manufacturing for donor-specific
   nTreg for clinical application in organ and stem cell transplantation.
   TCR repertoire analyses by next generation sequencing revealed
   impressive expansion by several log-steps of even very low-abundance
   alloantigen-specific nTreg clones. This novel method offers a simple
   approach for expanding antigen-specific nTreg and is characterized by
   high replicability and easy transferability to full GMP standards.
   An allogeneic B cell bank allows fast and GMP-compatible expansion of
   even low-abundance allospecific nTreg clones, which are more potent
   suppressors of specific alloresponses than their polyclonal
   counterparts, both in vitro and in vivo.

AB Objective: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   uncovers correlated activity between spatially distinct functionally
   related brain regions and offers clues about the integrity of functional
   brain circuits in people with chronic subjective tinnitus. We chose to
   investigate auditory network connectivity, adopting and extending
   previously used analyses methods to provide an independent evaluation of
   replicability. Design: Independent components analysis (ICA) was used to
   identify coherent patterns arising from spontaneous brain signals within
   the resting-state data. The auditory network component was extracted and
   evaluated. Bivariate and partial correlation analyses were performed on
   pre-defined regions of bilateral auditory cortex to assess functional
   connectivity. Study sample: Our design carefully matched participant
   groups for possible confounds, such as hearing status. Twelve patients
   (seven male, five female; mean age 66 years) all with chronic constant
   tinnitus and eleven controls (eight male, three female; mean age 68
   years) took part. Results: No significant differences were found in
   auditory network connectivity between groups after correcting for
   multiple statistical comparisons in the analysis. This contradicts
   previous findings reporting reduced auditory network connectivity;
   albeit at a less stringent statistical threshold. Conclusions: Auditory
   network connectivity does not appear to be reliably altered by the
   experience of chronic subjective tinnitus.

AB Individual genome-wide association (GWA) studies and their meta-analyses
   represent two approaches for identifying genetic loci associated with

   between individual GWA studies and meta-analyses are commonly observed,
   hence posing the critical question as to how to interpret their
   respective results properly. In this study, we performed a series of
   simulation studies to investigate and compare the statistical properties
   of the two approaches. Our results show that (1) as expected,
   meta-analysis of larger sample size is more powerful than individual GWA
   studies under the ideal setting of population homogeneity among
   individual studies; (2) under the realistic setting of heterogeneity
   among individual studies, detection of heterogeneity is usually
   difficult and meta-analysis (even with the random-effects model) may
   introduce elevated false positive and/or negative rates; (3) despite
   relatively small sample size, well-designed individual GWA study has the
   capacity to identify novel loci for complex traits; (4) replicability
   between meta-analysis and independent individual studies or between
   independent meta-analyses is limited, and thus inconsistent findings are
   not unexpected.

AB Open innovation research and practice recognize the important role of
   external complementors in value creation. At the same time, firms need
   to retain exclusive control over some essential components to capture
   value from their product and/or service system. This paper contributes
   to the literature by analyzing some of the trade-offs between openness
   to external value creation and closedness for internal value capture. It
   focuses on selective openness as a key variable and investigates how it
   affects value creation by external complementors, specifically the
   members of user innovation communities. Openness, it is hypothesized,
   matters to community members: The more open a product design is, the
   higher their sense of involvement in the innovation project, and the
   larger the effort they devote to it. Unlike prior literature, different
   forms and loci of openness are distinguished, specifically the
   transparency, accessibility, and replicability of different components
   of the product being developed. Hypotheses are tested based on survey
   data (n=309) from 20 online communities in the consumer electronics and
   information technology hardware industries. Multilevel regression
   analysis is used to account for clustering, and thus nonindependent
   data, at the community level. We find that openness indeed increases
   community members' involvement in the innovation project and their
   contributions to it. Interestingly, however, some forms and loci of
   openness strongly affect community perceptions and behavior, while
   others have limited or no impact. This finding suggests that, at least
   in relation to user communities, the trade-off that firms face between
   external value creation and internal value capture is softer than
   hitherto understood. Contingency factors that may be able to explain
   these patterns are advanced. For example, users are expected to value
   the form of openness that they have the capabilities and incentives to
   exploit. The findings in this paper extend the literature on selective
   openness in innovation. They emphasize the need to study the demand for
   different forms of openness at the subsystem level and align supply-side
   strategies to it. In managerial practice, a careful assessment of the
   demand for openness enables firms to successfully use selective openness
   and to effectively appropriate value from selectively open systems.

AB Background: Gait evaluation is difficult in pigs, especially when
   objective and quantitative data are needed, thus little research has
   been conducted in this species. There is considerable experience,
   however, with objective gait analysis in other species, such as horses
   and dogs. In this study, a pressure mat was used to establish baseline
   kinetic data for gait and its longitudinal development in growing,
   weaned piglets.
   Ten clinically healthy weaned piglets were trained to trot over a
   pressure mat. Measurements were performed weekly during 10 weeks,
   starting at 5 weeks of age. Four kinetic parameters were recorded for
   all four limbs: peak vertical force (PVF), load rate (LR), vertical
   impulse (VI) and peak vertical pressure (PVP). Three representative runs
   per measuring session per pig were collected. For each of the variables,
   left vs. right limb asymmetry-indices (ASI's) were calculated based on
   the average for that parameter per week. A linear mixed model was used
   to determine the influence of time (week), velocity, and limb (left vs.
   right, and fore vs. hind). Intra-class correlations were calculated to
   assess within-session replicability.
   Results: Intra-class correlations showed good within-session
   replicability. Body-weight normalized PVF (nPVF), LR (nLR), VI (nVI) and
   PVP (nPVP) were higher in the forelimbs than in the hind limbs. A higher
   velocity was associated with a higher nPVF, nLR and nPVP. All parameters
   varied between weeks. ASI of LR and VI were higher in the forelimbs than
   in the hind limbs. Velocity and time did not influence ASI of any of the
   variables.
   Conclusions: Kinetic pressure mat measurements from healthy weaned
   piglets are highly replicable within-session. However, these variables
   present a significant variability between-session, which may be due to
   conformational changes of the young, growing piglets. Velocity clearly
   influences nPVF, nLR and nPVP, and all kinetic variables have higher
   values in forelimbs than in hind limbs. As time and velocity do not
   affect ASI's, the latter are preferable tools when velocity cannot be
   controlled or when measurements are repeated over longer time intervals.
   The present study supports the use of a pressure mat as an objective way
   to analyze and quantify porcine gait.

AB While attention modification programs (AMP) have shown promise as
   laboratory-based treatments for social anxiety disorder, trials of
   internet-delivered AMP have not yielded significant differences between
   active and control conditions. To address these inconsistencies, we
   examined the moderational and mediational role of attention bias in the
   efficacy of attention training. We compared data reported by Carlbring
   et al. (2012) to an identical AMP condition, with the exception that
   participants were instructed to activate social anxiety fears prior to
   each attention training session (AMP + FACT; n = 39). We also compared
   all attention training groups to an internet-delivered
   cognitive-behavioral therapy (iCBT) condition (n = 40). Participants in
   the AMP + FACT group experienced greater reductions in social anxiety
   symptoms than both active (n = 40) and control (n = 39) groups reported
   by Carlbring et al., and did not differ in symptom reductions from the
   iCBT group. Higher attention bias predicted greater symptom reductions
   for participants who completed AMP, but not for the control group.
   Moreover, change in attention bias mediated the relationship between AMP
   group (active condition reported by Carlbring et al. versus AMP + FACT)
   and change in social anxiety symptoms. These results suggest the
   importance of interpreting findings related to symptom change in
   attention training studies in the context of bias effects. (C) 2013 The

   Proposed solutions align the incentives of all those involved in the

   significance to one of statistical power, renewing an emphasis on
   prediction and the pre-registration of hypotheses, changing the timing
   and method of peer-review, and increasing the rate at which replications
   are conducted and published. These strategies seek to unify incentives

AB Here, two studies seek to characterize a parsimonious common-denominator
   personality structure with optimal cross-cultural replicability.
   Personality differences are observed in all human populations and
   cultures, but lexicons for personality attributes contain so many
   distinctions that parsimony is lacking. Models stipulating the most
   important attributes have been formulated by experts or by empirical
   studies drawing on experience in a very limited range of cultures.
   Factor analyses of personality lexicons of nine languages of diverse
   provenance (Chinese, Korean, Filipino, Turkish, Greek, Polish,
   Hungarian, Maasai, and Senoufo) were examined, and their common
   structure was compared to that of several prominent models in
   psychology. A parsimonious bivariate model showed evidence of
   substantial convergence and ubiquity across cultures. Analyses involving
   key markers of these dimensions in English indicate that they are broad
   dimensions involving the overlapping content of the interpersonal
   circumplex, models of communion and agency, and morality/warmth and
   competence. These Big Two dimensionsSocial Self-Regulation and
   Dynamismprovide a common-denominator model involving the two most
   crucial axes of personality variation, ubiquitous across cultures. The
   Big Two might serve as an umbrella model serving to link diverse

AB Background: De Winter and Happee [1] examined whether science based on
   selective publishing of significant results may be effective in accurate
   estimation of population effects, and whether this is even more
   effective than a science in which all results are published (i.e., a
   science without publication bias). Based on their simulation study they
   concluded that "selective publishing yields a more accurate
   meta-analytic estimation of the true effect than publishing everything,
   (and that) publishing nonreplicable results while placing null results
   in the file drawer can be beneficial for the scientific collective"
   (p.4).
   Methods and Findings: Using their scenario with a small to medium
   population effect size, we show that publishing everything is more
   effective for the scientific collective than selective publishing of
   significant results. Additionally, we examined a scenario with a null
   effect, which provides a more dramatic illustration of the superiority
   of publishing everything over selective publishing.
   Conclusion: Publishing everything is more effective than only reporting
   significant outcomes.

AB Genetic reassortment between human and avian influenza viruses can
   create pandemic viruses. Influenza surveillance of pigs in Jilin
   Province, in China during 2007-2008 revealed that there were two
   distinguishable genotypes: a human-like H3N2 genotype and a
   double-reassortant genotype derived from the human H3N2 and avian H5
   viruses. In this study, viral infection potential, replication kinetics,
   and pathogenicity were compared. The solid-phase binding assay
   demonstrated that both viruses prominently maintained a preference for
   the human-type receptor and the reassortant A/swine/Jilin/37/2008
   (Sw/JL/37/08) showed relatively higher binding affinities than the
   non-reassortant A/swine/Jilin/19/2007 (Sw/JL/19/07). Replication
   kinetics showed that Sw/JL/37/08 had higher replicability in MDCK cells
   than Sw/JL/19/07. The mouse experiments clearly revealed that
   Sw/JL/37/08 had higher virulence than Sw/JL/19/07 as measured by more
   significant body weight loss, higher viral lung load, delayed viral
   clearance from lungs, and more severe pulmonary lesions. Sequence
   analysis indicated that the absence of glycosylation sites at residue
   126 of HA and 93 of NA, as well as the characteristic NS1 C-terminal PL
   residues of ESEV may account for the increased replication and
   pathogenicity of Sw/JL/37/08. These results may imply that human may
   have infection risk by the reassortant swine influenza virus and
   emphasize the necessity for enhanced viral surveillance strategies,
   which monitor reassortment events in nature to reduce the public health
   threat posed by influenza viruses with the potential for human-to-human
   transmission currently circulating in pig populations. (C) 2013 Elsevier

AB Previous research has not adequately assessed the independent
   contributions of component attentional processes to anxiety-linked
   biases. MacLeod and Sadler developed a novel, lexical decision task
   using negative and neutral word stimuli, to enable the independent
   measurement of attentional engagement and disengagement. Their results
   suggest that anxiety-linked attentional biases are associated with
   facilitated attentional engagement with negative information. The
   present study aimed to determine the replicability of these findings,
   with two important extensions. First, this study included positive word
   stimuli in the lexical decision task, to determine whether
   anxiety-linked attentional biases exist only towards negative
   information, or toward emotionally arousing information in general.
   Second, this study explored age-related differences in anxiety-linked
   attentional biases. Younger (N=32) and older adults (N=32) with both
   high and low trait anxiety completed the lexical decision task. The
   results suggest that heightened anxiety may be associated with a deficit
   in engaging with positive words. No age-related differences in
   anxiety-linked attentional biases were apparent.

AB The modern concept of popularity refers to what is easily comprehended
   and unsophisticated for the sake of interest. But it is likely to be
   hard to discuss popularity in classical Chinese literature, since the
   concept has not been developed yet. In premodern period, as literary
   works were in most cases composed in a literary style with poetic
   rhymes, it was nearly impossible that they gained popularity among the
   ordinary people. Furthermore, as intellectuals attached greater
   importance to the study of Yi(義) and Li(理), and the realization of the
   Confucian ideology, the literary works that pursued rhetorical
   embellishments and the preparation for state examination were considered
   low and degrading. Thus, the works that depicted the life of the common
   people in detail or expressed one’s personal sentiment could only be
   estimated properly when they were related to the study of Yi and Li. But
   in late Joseon period, as the intellectual class began to be divided
   into several groups, poor scholars who shared daily life with ordinary
   people endeavored to write without hierarchical and political notion.
   They were neither scholars with official post who were in charge of
   national documents, nor tasteful writers who belonged to literary
   societies. Their works can be estimated to be popular compared to those
   composed by intellectuals that give priority to the literature of manage
   state affairs(經國文章) and the literature of decoration of nation(華國文章).
   But it is also possible to say that their works have pure literary
   characteristics in their own way. They introduced irregular hanmun in
   their works which was widely spread in the daily life, while at the same
   time using expressions of traditional written language. In this article
   the popularity in classical Chinese literature in late Josen period was
   surveyed in three aspects; ⓐhaving close connection to daily life of
   ordinary people, without hierarchical and political notion of
   traditional literature. ⓑintroducing irregular hanmun escaping from the
   old styled written hanmun. ⓒadapting poetic hanmun without rhymes,
   escaping from the regular style of poetic rhyme. The popularity emerged
   in late Josen period is different from the modern concept of popularity
   that is connected to commercialism, replicability and crudity. But it is
   also possible to say that it represents another characteristics of
   popularity in respect of persuing of the new aesthetic value of real
   life.
AK 근대에 들어와서 문학과 예술을 논할 때 일반대중의 취향에 맞추어 이해하기 쉽고 흥미 본위의 특성을 통속성이라고 부르게 되었다.
   근대 이전의 문화지식층이 주로 담당하였던 한문학을 대상으로 삼으면서 근대적 의미의 통속성을 운위하는 것은 무리가 있다.
   한국한문학에서는 기본적으로 문언어법의 한문을 사용하고 韻語를 익힌 토대 위에 창작활동을 하여야 하였으므로, 구어 사용의 대중을
   독자층으로 확보할 수가 없었다. 더구나 한국학문학의 담당층이었던 사대부 지식인은 義理之學을 우위에 두고 정치이념을 구현하는 것을
   第一義로 삼았으므로, 시문의 형식미 자체를 추구하는 文章之學과 과거 합격을 위해 연마하는 科擧之學은 저속한 공부에 불과하였다.
   따라서 백성들의 삶을 세세하게 묘사하거나 개인 정감을 표현하는 것은 그것이 의리지학에 연계되어 있거나 연계되어 있다고 확신될 때만
   가치를 인정받을 수 있었다. 이것은 근세 이후 통속의 개념이 상업성이나 복제성, 저급성이란 의미로 사용되는 것과는 달랐다. 그러나
   조선 후기에는 사 계층의 분화와 더불어 중하층 백성들과 함께 ‘생활의 장’을 살아나간 寒士들이 계층적, 정치적 이념에서 벗어난
   독자적인 문학세계를 추구하였다. 그들은 大小文字를 담당하는 館閣文人도 아니고, 동호인 집단에서 인정받는 문예적 취향의 文人도
   아니었다. 그들은 스스로의 문자 활동에 대해 자조하면서도 나름대로의 자부심을 찾아나가야 하였다. 이들의 문학은 경국문장이나
   화국문장을 정점에 두는 사대부 문학의 관점에서 보면 매우 통속적이라고 할 수 있다. 하지만 문학의 정치성과 이념성을 탈각한 면에서
   보면 그 나름대로 순문학적인 특성을 지니고 있었다고 말할 수 있다. 또한 한사들의 문학세계는 행문의 관습에서는 문언어법을
   지키면서도 생활세계에서 활용된 변격한문을 도입하여 중층적인 표현체계를 활용하였다. 본고는 조선후기의 한문학에 대두된 통속성을 다음
   세 가지 측면에서 살펴보았다. ⓐ 經國文章 혹은 華國文章이라는 계층적, 정치적 이념으로부터 일탈되어 민간생활의 場에 밀착하는
   특성. ⓑ 문언어법과 운어 형식의 구속성을 벗어나 일상생활에서 널리 사용되던 변격한문의 문학적 활용. ⓒ 운자 사용의 관습성이
   강하였던 祭文 등의 양식에서 寒士들이 無韻의 형식으로 감정을 직서하는 방식의 채용. 조선후기 한문학에서 소재, 주제사상과 문체의
   측면에서 대두된 통속성은 근세 이후 상업성이나 복제성, 저급성이란 의미에서의 통속성과는 달랐다. 하지만 한문학이 추구한
   개인적․인격적 자기수양과 책임윤리의 실현이라는 본령에서 벗어나 생활의 장에 밀착한 새로운 미학을 지향하였다는 점에서 정통
   한문학과는 다른 통속성을 드러냈다고 말할 수 있다.

AB Background: Donor engagement in transitional settings, complex
   emergencies and fragile states is increasing. Neither short-term
   humanitarian aid nor traditional development financing are well adapted
   for such environments. Multi-donor trust funds, in their current form,
   can be unwieldy and subject to long delays in initiation and work best
   when national governments are already strong. We reviewed the aid
   modalities used in Zimbabwe through the period of crisis, 2008-2012 and
   their results and implications. Literature review and case experience
   was utilised. Discussion: By focusing on working with line ministries in
   non-contested sectors to determine local priorities rather than
   following global prescriptions, pooling funds to achieve scale rather
   than delivering through fragmented projects, and building on national
   systems and capacities rather than setting up parallel mechanisms, the
   Transition Fund Model employed in Zimbabwe by UNICEF and partners in
   partnership with the Inclusive Government was able to achieve important
   results in health, education, social support and water services in a
   challenging setting. In addition, forums for collaboration were
   developed that provided a platform for further action. The initial
   emphasis on service delivery diffused much of the political delicateness
   that impeded progress in other sectors. The Zimbabwean experience may
   provide a model of innovative financing for countries facing similar
   circumstances. Summary Such models may represent a new practical
   application of the Paris Principles, consistent with the major tenets of
   the 2011 New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States agreed in Busan. As
   we approach the Millennium Development Goal deadline, an over-arching,
   mutli-sectoral and independent evaluation of this approach is
   recommended in order to validate findings and assess broader
   replicability of this approach.

   NOVELTY - The method involves presenting a device-appropriate
   application user interface responsive to a document object model (DOM)
   structure by an abstraction layer. A user input is received from a
   rendered application user interface by a mobile application. An input
   event is received (106) from the abstraction layer by programming code
   referenced by the DOM. The DOM is reconfigured to reflect response by
   the application to the input in response to the received input event.
   The application user interface is updated by the abstraction layer
   responsive to the reconfiguring of the DOM.
   USE - Method for enabling provisioning and execution of a
   platform-independent application by using a client device. Uses include
   but are not limited to a cellphone, personal digital assistant (PDA),
   laptop computer and a desktop computer i.e. IBM personal computer.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables addressing and updating a defined portion
   of the application in response to application events without
   necessitating update of the application and propagating appearance and
   behavior of the application with consistency across heterogeneous device
   types so as to enable cross-device interoperability, replicability and
   compatibility of applications and data with consistency of user
   experience. The method enables designing the DOM such that mapping
   between data and behavior can remain the same across implementations of
   simple operating system (OS) to ensure that superstructure and
   applications operating in accordance with the superstructure retain
   consistent look and feel. The method enables avoiding need to maintain

AB The ability to repeat an experiment, known as replicability, is a basic
   concept of scientific research and also an important aspect in the field
   of eScience. The principles of Service Oriented Computing (SOC) and
   Cloud Computing, both based on high runtime dynamicity, are more and
   more adopted in the eScience domain. Simulation experiments exploiting
   these principles introduce significant challenges with respect to
   replicability. Current research activities mainly focus on how to
   exploit SOC and Cloud for eScience, while the aspect of replicability
   for such experiments is still an open issue. In this paper we define a
   general method to identify points of dynamicity in simulation
   experiments and to handle them in order to enable replicability. We
   systematically examine different types of service binding strategies,
   the main source of dynamicity, and derive a method and corresponding
   architecture to handle this dynamicity with respect to replicability.
   Our work enables scientists to perform simulation experiments that
   exploit the dynamicity and flexibility of SOC and Cloud Computing but
   still are repeatable.

AB Objective A Quantitative PCR method was established for detecting Human
   Bocavirus ( B19)and applied on the validation process indicating the
   removal of virus. Using this method and nanometer membrane filtration,
   the effect of virus removal on the productive process of blood products
   was evaluated. Methods Using the following primers, ( P1) 5'-GGC ACC TCT
   CAA AAC ACT -3'and (P2) 5'-GCA GTC CTT GCT GAT ACT C -3', at 95℃ for 3
   minutes,at 95℃ for 10 seconds,at 52℃ for 10 seconds, and at 72℃ for 10
   seconds,40 cycles were amplified respectively in each condition. The
   QPCR method used to detect B19 concentration in samples was established
   with the validation of its specificity, replicability and sensitivity.
   Last, this method was used to evaluate the effect of B19 removal in
   blood products with nanometer membrane filtration. Results Both intra
   and inter-assay of the methods have shown precision within <5% in count.
   The lowest detectable limit was 50 copies/muL. The titers of samples
   treated by nanometer membrane filtration descended by 3. 89logs.
   Conclusion A QPCR method with good specificity,replicability and
   sensitivity was successfully established and provides a theoretical
   foundation for the rapid and accurate detection of B19 and the
   validation of virus removal process.

AB Objective To investigate the feasibility of the dissolution method in
   distilled water instead of methylene blue soluble plasma, and to test
   the validation of methylene blue method for inactivating virus in serum
   content in order to study the quality control in blood drawing stations
   in accordance with the technical procedures (2012 edition) ( hereinafter
   referred to as" regulations" ) on Appendix F-19. Methods A known
   concentration of methylene blue was collected in standards after the
   colorimetric solid-phase extraction. An aqueous solution containing a
   known concentration of methylene blue was collected by the solid-phase
   colorimetric extraction method. A known concentration of methylene blue
   with 1% acetic acid and methanol solution was collected by direct
   colorimetric method. Three sets of numerical data were compared to
   investigate the effects of methylene blue in the operation of the
   solid-phase extraction. Results Using the colorimetric method, 1 to 5
   mumoL/L of 1% methylene blue acetate methanol solution was directly
   compared by the differences in color. Then , a solution containing 1 to
   5 mumoL/L methylene blue solution, a solution containing 1 to 5 mumoL/L
   methylene blue plasma obtained through the Waters Oasis HLB column
   solid-phase extraction, and a methanol solution containing 1 % acetic
   acid were compared with a colorimetric spectrophotometer. The results
   were compared to methylene blue at 92. 9% of the extraction rate. The
   linearity was satis-factory. Conclusion Using the solid-phase extraction
   spectrophotometer method to detect methylene blue, the methylene
   bluecontent had a favorable recovery rate and replicability. Hence,the
   Central Asian's routine quality control method is effective and feasible
   to detect the methylene blue content in virus-inactivated plasma. The
   dissolution of methylene blue in plasma after extraction or in distilled
   water/1 % acetic acid and methanol resulted in the same concentration of
   methylene blue. The values of methylene blue were close to the matching
   T-test value of 0.010 2,with P <0. 05,indicating that there was no
   statistically significant difference between the two values. The results
   suggest that when plasma is in shortage, distilled water or 1% acetic
   acid in methanol can substitute for blood plasma to detect the release
   of methylene blue contents.

   and DNS with three different degrees of fidelity: the
   POD-Galerkin-projection approach, the proportional feedback of
   time-resolved PTV data, and the feedback based on the extended Kalman
   filter. By solving a planar-jet problem as an example, we analyze the
   temporal- and spatial-filtering functions as well as the accuracy of
   velocity and pressure fields reconstructed from the PTV data. The
   results demonstrate that we can lower the measurement-noise levels and
   improve the accuracy/replicability by increasing the computational cost.

AB BACKGROUND: Achievement goal theory helps us understand what motivates
   students to participate in educational activities. However, measuring
   achievement goals in a precise manner is problematic. Elliot and
   McGregor's Achievement Goal Questionnaire (AGQ) and Elliot and
   Murayama's revised Achievement Goal Questionnaire (AGQ-R) are widely
   used to assess students' achievement goals. Both instruments were
   developed and validated using undergraduate psychology students in the
   USA.
   METHODS: In this study, our aims were to first of all, assess the
   construct validity of both questionnaires using a cohort of Australian
   pharmacy students and, subsequently, to test the generalizability and
   replicability of these tools more widely in schools of pharmacy in other
   English-speaking countries. The AGQ and the AGQ-R were administered
   during tutorial class time. Confirmatory factor analysis procedures,
   using AMOS 19 software, were performed to determine model fit.
   RESULTS: In contrast to the scale developers' findings, confirmatory
   factor analysis supported a superior model fit for the AGQ compared with
   the AGQ-R, in all countries under study.
   CONCLUSION: Validating measures of achievement goal motivation for use
   in pharmacy education is necessary and has implications for future
   research. Based on these results, the AGQ will be used to conduct future
   cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of the achievement goals of
   undergraduate pharmacy students from these countries.

AB Groundwater resources continue to be an important source of water supply
   for communities in developing countries. However, rapid population
   growth and urbanization, challenges the potential of groundwater to
   serve and meet the needs of growing populace. Various techniques have
   been developed over the last decade to assess groundwater vulnerability
   due changes in climate and prevailing natural environmental conditions.
   The difficulty in most of these methods has been intensive data
   requirements. This paper developed an innovative method called f-hydra
   index using three key parameters - flow accumulation (derived from
   Digital Elevation Model), landcover map and hydraulic conductivity. The
   results of the index were successfully evaluated with widely used index
   - DRASTIC (for the Densu River Basin of Ghana, West Africa). The
   comparison of f-hydra to DRASTIC shows highly correlated areas in
   mapping vulnerable regions in the study area. The f-hydra index proves a
   noble way to assess groundwater vulnerability to pollution in data
   scarce regions. Authors envisaged the testing of the model in many other
   regions to ascertain it's replicability globally.

PY 2014
AB BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the psychometric
   properties of Social Capital Questionnaire ( SCQ) developed by Onyx and
   Bullen (2000) among a sample of medical science students in Tehran
   University of Medical Sciences, Iran and to compare the factor analysis
   with findings from two previous studies in Australia and the United
   States.
   METHODS: Multistage cluster sampling was employed to recruit 293 medical
   science students (Male: 95/Female: 198) from 7 faculties in Tehran
   University of Medical Sciences. After translating SCQ into Persian
   applying back-translation technique and three-stage consensus panel, the
   questionnaires administered to the respondents and they were asked to
   complete them. Statistical Analysis was performed using SPSS version
   16.0 for Windows.
   RESULTS: Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was conducted to evaluate
   factor structure of the Persian SCQ (PSCQ),which showed a moderate
   replicability, validity, and reliability (Cronbach alpha= .79) to those
   found in previous studies. Twelve factors extracted with eight values
   greater than 1 which altogether accounted for 76.23% of the total
   variance. Applying Cattell's scree test, it was indicated that between
   seven and eight factor sextracted. The correlations between factors were
   detected in the low (at the lowest 0.002) to modest (at the highest
   0.614) range.
   CONCLUSION: The differences found in the factor analysis between the
   studies may be ascribed to the various types of populations studied.
   Despite the difference in populations studied, our findings support the
   meaningful nessof P-SCQ as an instrument that is worthy of further
   attention for use in social health researches, although more studies are
   recommended to help researchers in comparing its variety in dimensions
   of different communities.

   for replicability. However, the effect observed was both significant and
   comparable to that obtained from a recent meta-analysis for the relevant

   support for the existence of imagined contact effects than currently

AB Objectives: Examine the reliability of sociodemographic variables in
   predicting initiation of breastfeeding within an hour of birth
   (EarlyBF), using data from 1998, 2003 and 2008-2009.
   Study design: A replication analysis using the Kenya Demographic and
   Health Survey (KDHS) data collected in 1998, 2003 and 2008-2009. The
   candidate predictor variables were child's gender, home or health
   facility place of birth, vaginal or caesarean mode of birth, urban or
   rural setting, province of residence, Wealth Index and maternal
   education, occupation, literacy and media exposure.
   Setting: Kenya.
   Participants: 6375 dyads of mothers aged 15-49 and their children aged
   0-23 months (2125 dyads in each of the survey years).
   Results: Mode of birth and province were statistically significant
   predictors of EarlyBF in 1998, 2003 and 2008-2009. Children delivered
   through caesarean section were non-EarlyBF in 1998 (OR 2.63, 95% CI 1.72
   to 4.04), 2003 (OR 3.36, 95% CI 1.83 to 6.16) and 2008 (OR 3.51, 95% CI
   2.17 to 5.69). The same was true of those living in the Western province
   in 1998 (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.61 to 4.43), 2003 (OR 4.92, 95% CI 3.01 to
   8.04) and 2008 (OR 6.07, 95% CI 3.54 to 10.39).
   Conclusions: The 1998 KDHS data do not provide the basis for reliable
   prediction of EarlyBF, with reliability conceptualised as replicability
   of findings using highly similar data sets from 2003 and 2008-2009. Most
   of the demographic and socioeconomic variables were unreliable
   predictors of EarlyBF. We speculate that activities in parts or all of
   Kenya changed the analysis context in the period between 1998 and
   2008-2009, and these changes were of a sufficient magnitude to affect
   the relationships under investigation. The degree to which this is a
   general problem in child health research is not known, calling for
   further research to investigate this methodological issue with other
   health end points and other data.

AB Limnology has been greatly influenced by The lake as a Microcosm
   (Forbes, 1887), which described a holistic focus on the internal
   machinations of singular, island-like aquatic ecosystems. I consider
   three persistent influences of The lake as a Microcosm: as an organizing
   paradigm for the teaching of limnology relative to its practice; the
   idea that inland waters are like islands, and the replicability of types
   of inland waters. Based on inspection of recent peer-reviewed literature
   and 32 limnology texts, we teach limnology according to Forbes but do
   not practice it in that holistic context. Instead, we practice limnology
   as aquatic ecology. Based on novel analyses of species-area
   relationships for 275 inland waters and 392 islands, inland waters are
   more like continental habitat patches than islands; the island metaphor
   is poetic but not accurate. Based on a quantitative review of beta
   diversity (40 data sets representing 10,576 inland waters and 26 data
   sets representing 1529 terrestrial sites), aquatic systems are no more
   replicable than are terrestrial systems; a typological approach to
   limnology is no more justified than it is in terrestrial systems.
   I conclude that a former distinction between limnology and aquatic
   ecology no longer applies, and that we should define limnology as the
   ecology of inland waters. Also, we should not consider lakes and rivers
   as islands that represent other systems of the same type, but should
   consider them as open, interactive habitat patches that vary according
   to their geology and biogeography. I suggest modern limnology operates
   according to 3 paradigms, which combine to form 3 broad limnological
   disciplines and establish a basis for a plural, interactive view of
   lakes and rivers as microcosms. This model of modern limnology may help
   better connect it to ecology and biogeography and help limnology be even
   more relevant to science and society

AB In my doctoral thesis, I overviewed that the implication of
   non-delegation doctrine in the Unites of States has transformed as
   becoming administrative state and, now, this doctrine becomes to be
   found in administrative law through due-process principle. In that
   thesis, I examined the non-delegation doctrine based on due-process
   principle. To achieve it, I considered it from three points of view:
   substantial due-process under which a delegation is not proper unless
   the legislature impose substantial restriction on agencies discretion
   enough to guarantee that such discretion is not limitless; structural
   due-process under which the person incurring damages from the act of
   agencies will be given an opportunity to have courts' judicial review on
   constitutionality of such delegation; and procedural due-process under
   which governmental agencies exercise their legislative rights by
   supplementing legitimacy through deliberation and participation. Under
   the structural due-process, in this paper, I put the judicial branch,
   monitoring legitimacy of delegation, and the executive branch,
   requesting for judicial deference to their interpretation, in equal
   position. And then, based on the assumption that the structure of the
   Constitution itself where a judicial review is to be expected justifies
   legislative delegation, I explore who is the best institution to
   interpret, that is to say, what competence is required, or who has the
   competence like that. For this, I introduce the Institutional Tern
   theory under which dogmatism and formalism of jurisprudence are
   criticized and the law must become reflexive and bottom-up. In spite of
   their differences, most of supporters of the theory assert that the
   judicial branch should defer to the interpretation of the executive
   because of its competence as responsibility and expertise. Depending on
   the type of public interest the social community desires to have, the
   legacy of legislation and its implementation would be the form of either
   industrial regulation and environment-friendly or industrial
   deregulation and environmental development. In terms of this, in this
   paper, I state my view that the role of courts is to strike balance of
   them and the values of legal system of the followings should be
   considered as standards to be applied by the courts at the moment:
   predictability; replicability; systemic consistency; responsiveness;
   justice; fairness; doctrinal stability; social congruence; social value
   formation, and so on. In doing so, we can recognize that the
   consideration of institutional competence and value of legal system is
   posted in the course of balancing between the judicial branch and
   executive branch as per changes in social and environmental context,
   since they go along with the history of justification model of
   administrative state.
AK 미국의 입법권 위임금지법리가 오늘날 행정국가화 현상과 더불어 변용되어 이제는 듀ㆍ프로세스를 통해 행정법상에서 찾아볼 수 있게
   되었다. 학위 논문에서는 이러한 듀ㆍ프로세스법리를 세 가지 관점으로 나누어 살펴보고 있다. 즉, 의회는 행정기관의 재량이 무제한인
   것은 아님을 보증하기에 충분한 실체적인 제약을 두지 않으면 위임이 적절한 것으로서 인정되지 않는다고 하는 실체적 듀ㆍ프로세스,
   위임시에는 행정기관의 입법담당자에게는 중요한 정치적 책임이 동반되기 때문에 행정기관의 행위로 피해를 입은 경우에는 사법심사를 통해
   그 위임의 합헌성을 심사받을 기회가 주어진다고 하는 의미에서의 구조적 듀ㆍ프로세스, 마지막으로 행정기관이 숙고와 참여로 정당성을
   보완하는 절차를 통해 그 입법권을 행사한다고 하는 절차적 듀ㆍ프로세스라는 3가지로 나누어 현대행정국가에 있어서의 위임금지법리의
   의미를 재검토하고자 했다. 이글은 그중에서도 구조적 듀ㆍ프로세스에서는 사법심사가 예정되어 있다고 하는 헌법구조 그 자체가 행정에
   입법권을 위임하는 것을 정당화한다고 하는 구조를 전제로 그 통제의 주체인 사법부와 사법부에 겸양을 요구하는 행정부를 동등하게
   두고, 해석의 적임자는 누구인가, 즉 해석에 있어서의 각 부문(제도)의 적성을 고찰했다. 이를 위해, 사법의 도그마티즘이나
   형식주의를 비판하여 법은 응답적이고 보텀ㆍ업적인 것이지 않으면 안된다고 하는 제도전회론을 소개하고 있다. 제도전회론의 지지자들은
   조금씩 차이는 있지만 오늘날 행정부의 책임성과 전문성이라는 제도적성을 판단기준으로 할 때, 사법은 행정의 해석에 겸양하지 않으면
   안된다고 하는 것을 주장의 요지로 하고 있다. 입법과 그 집행의 결과는 그 사회공동체가 바라고 있는 공익은 어떤 것인가에 의해
   산업규제강화나 친환경적인 형태로 나타나는 것도, 산업규제완화나 환경개발적인 형태로 나타나는 것도 가능할 것이다. 이에 대해서는
   어떤 일방으로 치우치지 않도록 양방향의 균형을 맞추는 것이 법원의 역할이고, 그 기준으로서 제도의 적성에 못지않게 예견가능성,
   반복가능성, 일관성, 응답성, 공정성, 공평성, 안정성, 사회의 조화, 사회적 가치의 형성과 같은 법시스템 그 자체가 가지고 있는
   가치가 고려되지 않으면 안된다고 하는 논의를 소개했다. 다만, 제도적성과 법시스템적 가치의 고려는 행정국가의 정당화모델의 역사와
   그 흐름을 함께하고 있다는 점에서 사회문맥과 환경의 변화에 따른 사법부와 행정부의 균형잡기과정에서 행해지고 있음을 알 수 있고,
   해석의 주도권을 어디에 갖게 할 것인가는 그 사회의 수준과 놓여져 있는 상황에 따라 판단되어야 할 것이다.

AB Objectives: High-quality reporting of treatment details can aid
   replication of study results in real-world clinical practice. The
   Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture
   (STRICTA) is a reporting guideline for key elements of acupuncture
   interventions in clinical trials. This study used STRICTA to investigate
   whether Cochrane reviews of acupuncture adequately report important
   treatment details.
   Design: Systematic review Methods: Cochrane reviews of acupuncture were
   identified from The Cochrane Library (issue 7, 2012). Randomised
   controlled trials (RCTs) included in the reviews and published after
   2005 were obtained. Using STRICTA, we extracted acupuncture-related
   information from the Cochrane reviews and the RCTs. The characteristics
   of the included studies' table were the major source of intervention
   information from Cochrane reviews. Reporting quality of acupuncture
   interventions in Cochrane reviews was assessed and compared with the
   respective RCTs.
   Results: 25 Cochrane reviews of acupuncture and 92 RCTs met the
   selection criteria. Cochrane reviews were 16% less likely to report the
   acupuncture-related items of STRICTA than RCTs (risk ratio 0.84, 95% CI
   0.79 to 0.88, I-2=8%). Information was significantly better reported for
   10 of the 15 treatment-group items of STRICTA in RCTs than in Cochrane
   reviews (p<0.05), while four items did so without statistical
   significance. One item related to practitioner background was
   significantly better reported in Cochrane reviews.
   Conclusions: Reporting quality of treatment details in Cochrane reviews
   of acupuncture was insufficient with regard to STRICTA, even though such
   information was readily reported in RCTs. The overall quality of
   reporting of the RCTs, while better than the reviews, was also often
   suboptimal. Use of STRICTA guideline during the review process is
   recommended to adequately report the key treatment components in
   Cochrane reviews of acupuncture. The potential impact of STRICTA to the
   replicability and utilisation of reviews in future research and practice
   needs to be investigated.

AB High-index-contrast optical devices form the backbone of densely
   integrated photonic circuits. While these devices are traditionally
   fabricated using lithography and etching, their performance is often
   limited by defects and sidewall roughness arising from fabrication
   imperfections. This paper reports a versatile, roll-to-roll and backend
   compatible technique for the fabrication of high-performance,
   high-index-contrast photonic structures in composition-engineered
   chalcogenide glass (ChG) thin films. Thin film ChG have emerged as
   important materials for photonic applications due to their high
   refractive index, excellent transparency in the infrared and large Kerr
   non-linearity. Both thermally evaporated and solution processed As-Se
   thin films are successfully employed to imprint waveguides and
   micro-ring resonators with high replicability and low surface roughness
   (0.9 nm). The micro-ring resonators exhibit an ultra-high quality-factor
   of 4 x 10(5) near 1550 nm wavelength, which represents the highest value
   reported in ChG micro-ring resonators. Furthermore, sub-micron
   nanoimprint of ChG films on non-planar plastic substrates is
   demonstrated, which establishes the method as a facile route for
   monolithic fabrication of high-index-contrast devices on a wide array of
   unconventional substrates.

   universities aiming to facilitate and enhance students' learning. In
   order to increase the chances for success of VLEs implementation it is
   essential to identify the factors which influence the students' decision
   making as far as accepting and using VLEs are concerned. In this paper
   we are applying one of the most popular models, the so-called Unified
   Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model developed by
   Venkatesh et al. (2003) to identify and test the underlying factors
   influencing VLE acceptance and use. UTAUT is a relatively new model
   sparsely applied in cross-cultural settings and in the context of Higher
   Education (Straub, 2009). We are testing the model in four business
   schools in universities in three different countries: the UK, Russia and
   Jordan. The results show that although all items from the original UTAUT
   questionnaire have their place in the final groupings obtained through
   the factor analysis, the `clean' agglomeration of items into groups
   shown by the original paper and a few others could not be replicated in
   the individual countries or in the overall sample despite the good
   sample size obtained in our study. The paper raises a question about the
   replicability of the original results and calls for reconsideration of
   the way the model is applied.

AB Although replication is a central tenet of science, direct replications
   are rare in psychology. This research tested variation in the
   replicability of 13 classic and contemporary effects across 36
   independent samples totaling 6,344 participants. In the aggregate, 10
   effects replicated consistently. One effect - imagined contact reducing
   prejudice - showed weak support for replicability. And two effects -
   flag priming influencing conservatism and currency priming influencing
   system justification - did not replicate. We compared whether the
   conditions such as lab versus online or US versus international sample
   predicted effect magnitudes. By and large they did not. The results of
   this small sample of effects suggest that replicability is more
   dependent on the effect itself than on the sample and setting used to
   investigate the effect.

AB Schnall, Benton, and Harvey (2008) hypothesized that physical
   cleanliness reduces the severity of moral judgments. In support of this
   idea, they found that individuals make less severe judgments when they
   are primed with the concept of cleanliness (Exp. 1) and when they wash
   their hands after experiencing disgust (Exp. 2). We conducted direct
   replications of both studies using materials supplied by the original
   authors. We did not find evidence that physical cleanliness reduced the
   severity of moral judgments using samples sizes that provided over .99
   power to detect the original effect sizes. Our estimates of the overall
   effect size were much smaller than estimates from Experiment 1 (original
   d = -0.60, 95% CI [-1.23, 0.04], N = 40; replication d = -0.01, 95% CI
   [-0.28, 0.26], N = 208) and Experiment 2 (original d = -0.85, 95% CI
   [-1.47, -0.22], N = 43; replication d = 0.01, 95% CI [-.34, 0.36], N =
   126). These findings suggest that the population effect sizes are
   probably substantially smaller than the original estimates. Researchers
   investigating the connections between cleanliness and morality should
   therefore use large sample sizes to have the necessary power to detect
   subtle effects.

AB Eyal, Liberman, and Trope (2008) established that people judged moral
   transgressions more harshly and virtuous acts more positively when the
   acts were psychologically distant than close. In a series of conceptual
   and direct replications, Gong and Medin (2012) came to the opposite
   conclusion. Attempting to resolve these inconsistencies, we conducted
   four high-powered replication studies in which we varied temporal
   distance (Studies 1 and 3), social distance (Study 2) or construal level
   (Study 4), and registered their impact on moral judgment. We found no
   systematic effect of temporal distance, the effect of social distance
   consistent with Eyal et al., and the reversed effect of direct construal
   level manipulation, consistent with Gong and Medin. Possible
   explanations for the incompatible results are discussed.

AB Replication is at the heart of all empirical sciences. However, there
   are no standard procedures for establishing the replicability of a
   pattern of correlations found linking a particular variable to an
   inventory or battery of other measures. This article introduces 2
   statistics for quantifying the expected replicability of a pattern of
   associations (i.e., correlations, slope coefficients) between a variable
   of interest and a SET of other variables, items, measures, and so on.
   Using simulations and real data, we illustrate that these statistics are
   highly accurate estimates of the expected replicability of an observed
   pattern of correlations. These statistics can readily be used to
   indicate the replicability of patterns of association indexed by other
   statistics (e.g., regression slopes or covariances) and can be applied
   to other contexts, such as estimating the reliability of profile
   correlations. It is recommended that these statistics are regularly
   reported in such studies.

AB High-index-contrast optical devices form the backbone of densely
   integrated photonic circuits. While these devices are traditionally
   fabricated using lithography and etching, their performance is often
   limited by defects and sidewall roughness arising from fabrication
   imperfections. This paper reports a versatile, roll-to-roll and backend
   compatible technique for the fabrication of high-performance,
   high-index-contrast photonic structures in composition-engineered
   chalcogenide glass (ChG) thin films. Thin film ChG have emerged as
   important materials for photonic applications due to their high
   refractive index, excellent transparency in the infrared and large Kerr
   non-linearity. Both thermally evaporated and solution processed As-Se
   thin films are successfully employed to imprint waveguides and
   micro-ring resonators with high replicability and low surface roughness
   (0.9 nm). The micro-ring resonators exhibit an ultra-high quality-factor
   of 4 times 10 5 near 1550 nm wavelength, which represents the highest
   value reported in ChG micro-ring resonators. Furthermore, sub-micron
   nanoimprint of ChG films on non-planar plastic substrates is
   demonstrated, which establishes the method as a facile route for
   monolithic fabrication of high-index-contrast devices on a wide array of
   unconventional substrates.

AB Objectives The objective of this study was to assess whether National
   Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment
   (HTA)-funded randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in the HTA
   journal were described in sufficient detail to replicate in practice.
   Setting RCTs published in the HTA journal.
   Participants 98 RCTs published in the HTA journal up to March 2011.
   Completeness of the intervention description was assessed independently
   by two researchers using a checklist, which included assessments of
   participants, intensity, schedule, materials and settings. Disagreements
   in scoring were discussed in the team; differences were then explored
   and resolved.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures Proportion of trials rated as
   having a complete description of the intervention (primary outcome
   measure). The proportion of drug trials versus psychological and
   non-drug trials rated as having a complete description of the
   intervention (secondary outcome measures).
   Results Components of the intervention description were missing in 68/98
   (69.4%) reports. Baseline characteristics and descriptions of settings
   had the highest levels of completeness with over 90% of reports
   complete. Reports were less complete on patient information with 58.2%
   of the journals having an adequate description. When looking at
   individual intervention types, drug intervention descriptions were more
   complete than non-drug interventions with 33.3% and 30.6% levels of
   completeness, respectively, although this was not significant
   statistically. Only 27.3% of RCTs with psychological interventions were
   deemed to be complete, although again these differences were not
   significant statistically.
   Conclusions Ensuring the replicability of study interventions is an
   essential part of adding value in research. All those publishing
   clinical trial data need to ensure transparency and completeness in the
   reporting of interventions to ensure that study interventions can be
   replicated.

   structural and configurally invariant second order models, suggesting
   some level of misspecification in the global scales of Extraversion,
   Anxiety, Tough-Mindedness, Independence, and Self-Control. However, the
   degree of misspecification was slight. Overall, the analyses generally
   supported the proposed structure of the 16PF5.

AB A field survey with a sample of 98 households was carried out in
   Chaganbulige, Siziwang Banner, Inner Mongolia in order to understand
   herdsmens perception of climate change and compare it with
   meteorological data and the official record of extreme climate events.
   The results showed that most herdsmen correctly perceived the change in
   temperature, but they had inexact judgement on precipitation, wind and
   sandstorm. In the past 40 years, temperature in Siziwang Banner was
   slowly increasing. The precipitation and storms were fluctuating
   greatly, but the long-term trend did not change much though most
   herdsmen reported that the rainfall was significantly decreasing. Recent
   years of extreme climate events impressed herdsmen most. As to the
   impacts of extreme climate events, drought was most impressive to
   herders followed by snowstorms and sandstorms. For adapting to climate
   change herdsmen had spontaneously taken various adaptive measures, of
   which 22 adaptation measures were reported in the survey. The top five
   measures that were used by most herdsmen are storing more hay and
   forage, reducing the herd size, building warm shed, borrowing money
   (loan), and not let next generations be herders. Others include building
   corral, digging well, planting fodder, cooperation in vaccinations of
   cattle, reducing household expenditures, changing grazing location,
   renting grassland, introducing new breeds, savings, wage labor, giving
   up herding, alternative livelihoods (e.g. tourism), sharing herding
   arrangement, etc. The 22 spontaneous adaptation measures were assessed
   by experts with the method of multiple criteria analysis (MCA). The
   criteria include effectiveness, economic benefits, flexibility,
   no-regret, side-effect, compliance with government policies and plans,
   compatibility with development goals, and replicability. The results
   showed that building warm shed, the introduction of new breeds, hay and
   forage storage, reducing the herd size and wage labor met the most
   criteria. The spontaneous adaptation measures were further screened by
   herdsmen, researchers, and local government officials with the
   participatory method. The results showed that measures such as building
   warm shed, introduction of new breeds, hay and forage storage, reducing
   the herd size and loan were more effective than others, which did not
   totally coincide with the results of expert assessment. To support the
   spontaneous adaptation measures which were selected to be most practical
   and effective, the herders identified the following policies that were
   mostly needed, i.e. loan support, the improvement of social security,
   accurate weather forecasts and pest forecasts, animal insurance,
   training, market access enhancement, enhancement of infrastructure, warm
   shed subsidies and drinking water project. Those policies would improve
   herdsmens ability of adapting to climate change, help herdsmen to cope
   with extreme climate events, and reduce their vulnerability of
   livelihoods.

   literally, to cleanse themselves. In an attempt to build upon these
   findings, we conducted a series of direct replications of Study 2 from
   Z&L's seminal report. We used Z&L's original materials and methods,
   investigated samples that were more representative of the general
   population, investigated samples from different countries and cultures,
   and substantially increased the power of our statistical tests. Despite
   multiple good-faith efforts, however, we were unable to detect a Macbeth

   kinetic data for gait and its longitudinal development in growing,
   weaned piglets. Ten clinically healthy weaned piglets were trained to
   trot over a pressure mat. Measurements were performed weekly during 10
   weeks, starting at 5 weeks of age. Four kinetic parameters were recorded
   for all four limbs: peak vertical force (PVF), load rate (LR), vertical
   impulse (VI) and peak vertical pressure (PVP). Three representative runs
   per measuring session per pig were collected. For each of the variables,
   left vs. right limb asymmetry-indices (ASI's) were calculated based on
   the average for that parameter per week. A linear mixed model was used
   to determine the influence of time (week), velocity, and limb (left vs.
   right, and fore vs. hind). Intra-class correlations were calculated to
   assess within-session replicability. Results: Intra-class correlations
   showed good within-session replicability. Body-weight normalized PVF
   (nPVF), LR (nLR), VI (nVI) and PVP (nPVP) were higher in the forelimbs
   than in the hind limbs. A higher velocity was associated with a higher
   nPVF, nLR and nPVP. All parameters varied between weeks. ASI of LR and
   VI were higher in the forelimbs than in the hind limbs. Velocity and
   time did not influence ASI of any of the variables. Conclusions: Kinetic
   pressure mat measurements from healthy weaned piglets are highly
   replicable within-session. However, these variables present a
   significant variability between-session, which may be due to
   conformational changes of the young, growing piglets. Velocity clearly
   influences nPVF, nLR and nPVP, and all kinetic variables have higher
   values in forelimbs than in hind limbs. As time and velocity do not
   affect ASI's, the latter are preferable tools when velocity cannot be
   controlled or when measurements are repeated over longer time intervals.
   The present study supports the use of a pressure mat as an objective way
   to analyze and quantify porcine gait.

AB Concerns have been raised recently about the replicability of behavioral
   priming effects, and calls have been issued to identify priming
   methodologies with effects that can be obtained in any context and with
   any population. I argue that such expectations are misguided and
   inconsistent with evolutionary understandings of the brain as a
   computational organ. Rather, we should expect priming effects to be
   highly sensitive to variations in experimental features and subject
   populations. Such variation does not make priming effects frivolous or
   capricious but instead can be predicted a priori. However, absent
   theories specifying the precise contingencies that lead to such
   variation, failures to replicate another researcher's findings will
   necessarily be ambiguous with respect to the inferences that can be
   made. Priming research is not yet at the stage where such theories
   exist, and therefore failures are uninformative at the current time.
   Ultimately, priming researchers themselves must provide direct
   replications of their own effects; researchers have been deficient in
   meeting this responsibility and have contributed to the current state of
   confusion. The recommendations issued in this article reflect concerns
   both with the practice of priming researchers and with the inappropriate
   expectations of researchers who have failed to replicate others' priming
   effects.

AB There has been increasing criticism of the way psychologists conduct and
   analyze studies. These critiques as well as failures to replicate
   several high-profile studies have been used as justification to proclaim
   a replication crisis in psychology. Psychologists are encouraged to
   conduct more exact replications of published studies to assess the
   reproducibility of psychological research. This article argues that the
   alleged crisis of replicability is primarily due to an epistemological
   misunderstanding that emphasizes the phenomenon instead of its
   underlying mechanisms. As a consequence, a replicated phenomenon may not
   serve as a rigorous test of a theoretical hypothesis because identical
   operationalizations of variables in studies conducted at different times
   and with different subject populations might test different theoretical
   constructs. Therefore, we propose that for meaningful replications,
   attempts at reinstating the original circumstances are not sufficient.
   Instead, replicators must ascertain that conditions are realized that
   reflect the theoretical variable(s) manipulated (and/or measured) in the
   original study.

AB A decade of research has demonstrated the explanatory potential of
   interplay between genetic variants and environmental factors in the
   development of common mental disorders. Initial findings have undergone
   tests of replicability and specificity. Some gene-environment
   interactions have been confirmed, some have not replicated and yet other
   turned out to be more specific than initially thought. Specific and
   complementary roles of genetic factors have been delineated: a common
   functional length polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene
   (5-HTTLPR) moderated the effect of childhood maltreatment on chronic
   depression in adulthood, but did not substantially influence the effects
   of adult stressful life events on the onset of new depressive episodes;
   in contrast, a common functional polymorphism in the brain-derived
   neurotrophic factor gene (BDNF) moderated the effect of stressful life
   events in adulthood in triggering new depressive episodes, but did not
   influence the effects of childhood maltreatment. Molecular mechanisms
   underlying gene-environment interactions are being uncovered, including
   DNA methylation and other epigenetic modifications. New gene-environment
   interactions continue to be reported, still largely from
   hypothesis-driven research. Statistical and biological prioritization
   strategies are proposed to facilitate a systematic discovery of novel
   gene-environment interactions in genome-wide analyses.

AB Buildings worldwide account for nearly 40% of global energy consumption.
   The biggest energy consumer in buildings is the Heating, Ventilation and
   Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. HVAC also ranks top in terms of number
   of complaints by tenants. Maintaining HVAC systems in good conditions
   through early fault detection is thus a critical problem. The problem,
   however, is difficult since HVAC systems are large in scale, consisting
   of many coupling subsystems, building and equipment dependent, and
   working under time-varying conditions. In this paper, a model-based and
   data-driven method is presented for robust system-level fault detection
   with potential for large-scale implementation. It is a synergistic
   integration of: ) Statistical Process Control (SPC) for measuring and
   analyzing variations; 2) Kalman filtering based on gray-box models to
   provide predictions and to determine SPC control limits; and (3) system
   analysis for analyzing propagation of faults' effects across subsystems.
   In the method, two new SPC rules are developed for detecting sudden and
   gradual faults. The method has been tested against a simulation model of
   the HVAC system for a 420-meter-high building. It detects both sudden
   faults and gradual degradation, and both device and sensor faults.
   Furthermore, the method is simple and generic, and has potential
   replicability and scalability.
   Note to Practitioners-HVAC systems work under time-varying weather and
   cooling load, and it is therefore difficult to detect faults. In
   addition, the various devices of HVAC systems require the detection
   method simple and robust so that it has good replicability and
   scalability. A gray-box model-based and data-driven method is developed
   in this paper. It is a novel combination of SPC, Kalman filter, and
   system analysis. By measuring and analyzing variations of model
   parameters, a fault can be detected when it causes these parameters to
   deviate from their normal ranges. The method detects both sudden and
   gradual faults with high detection rate and low false alarm rate. It
   also detects effects of faults in one subsystem on another to help
   detect and confirm device faults.

AB PurposeTo identify regional network covariance patterns of gray matter
   associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to further evaluate its
   replicability and stability.
   Materials and MethodsThis study applied a multivariate analytic approach
   based on scaled subprofile modeling (SSM) to structural magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) data from 19 patients with AD and 19 healthy
   controls (HC). We further applied the derived covariance patterns to
   examine the replicability and stability of AD-associated covariance
   patterns in an independent dataset (13 AD and 14 HC) acquired with a
   different scanner.
   ResultsThe AD-associated covariance patterns identified from SSM
   combined principal components mainly involved the temporal lobe and
   parietal lobe. The expression of covariance patterns was significantly
   higher in AD patients than HC (t((36))=5.84, P=5.75E-7) and predicted
   the AD/HC group membership (84% sensitivity and 90% specificity). In
   replicability evaluation, the expression of the forward applied
   covariance patterns was still statistically significant and had
   acceptable discriminability (69% sensitivity and 71% specificity).
   ConclusionAD patients showed regional gray matter alterations in a
   reliable covariance manner. The results suggest that SSM has utility for
   characterizing covariant features, and therefore can assist with further
   understanding covariance patterns of gray matter in AD based on the view
   of the network. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2014;39:143-149. (c) 2013 Wiley

AB Community Reserves and Conservation Reserves illustrate a

   protected area (PA) network of India. Such reserves mark a shift towards
   an inclusive and decentralised approach within PAs in the country. Three
   such reserves in southern India: the Aghanashini Lion-tailed Macaque
   Conservation Reserve, Kadalundi-Vallikunnu Community Reserve and
   Thirupaddaimaradur Conservation Reserve, were selected to examine the
   reasons for their creation, management and stakeholder dynamics, with an
   aim to review their productivity and potential replicability. The study
   was carried out through semi-structured interviews with Forest
   Department officials, local community members and researchers working in
   the three reserves. Insufficient interaction between the stakeholders
   appeared to be a common issue in two reserves. The functioning of the
   reserves was also influenced, and in some cases negatively affected, by
   local politics. Financial stability was crucial in the functioning of
   reserves, as was consistency in interaction and appropriate monitoring
   of management plans. These elements are recommended for sustaining such
   reserves and creating community-based management systems for
   conservation, to support an inclusive approach to PA management.

   13 subjects. Based on an anatomically placed region-of-interest, we
   compared the caudate response to a hand signal indicating the imminent

   of 13 dogs had a positive differential caudate response to the signal
   indicating reward. The mean differential caudate response was 0.09%,
   which was similar to a comparable human study. These results show that

   the selection of hypotheses to be examined in the follow-up study as
   well as when there is no division of roles into the primary and the
   follow-up study. We show that existing meta-analysis methods are not
   appropriate for this problem, and suggest novel methods instead. We
   prove that our multiple testing procedures control for appropriate error
   rates. The suggested family-wise error rate controlling procedure is
   valid for arbitrary dependence among the test statistics within each
   study. A more powerful procedure is suggested for false discovery rate
   (FDR) control. We prove that this procedure controls the FDR if the test
   statistics are independent within the primary study, and independent or
   have positive dependence in the follow-up study. For arbitrary
   dependence within the primary study, and either arbitrary dependence or
   positive dependence in the follow-up study, simple conservative
   modifications of the procedure control the FDR. We demonstrate the
   usefulness of these procedures via simulations and real data examples.

AB Trait anxiety is a unitary construct reflecting individual differences
   in the tendency to experience anxious symptomatology, typically measured
   with questionnaires such as the Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory
   (STAI-T). Recent research by Rudaizky, Page, and MacLeod has found
   evidence that two different dimensions of trait anxiety account for
   independent variance in trait anxiety scores. These dimensions are
   anxiety reactivity (AR), reflecting the probability of experiencing an
   anxious reaction, and anxiety perseveration (AP), reflecting the
   persistence of anxious symptoms once elicited. There are two key issues
   addressed in this study: first, the replicability of Rudaizky etal.'s
   findings and second, the ability of the measures of AR and AP developed
   by Rudaizky etal. to predict independent variance in STAI-T scores after
   statistically controlling for variance shared with a measure of
   depression. Regression analysis determined that AR and AP do account for
   independent variance in STAI-T trait anxiety scores even after
   statistically controlling for depression. The implications of these
   findings for the understanding of anxiety vulnerability are discussed.

AB Forests provide several ecosystem services and its presence near streams
   can increase water quality and quantity. In human-dominated landscapes

   propose a methodological framework to: (i) assess the contribution of

   vegetation in the landscape, and (ii) prioritize areas for recovery and
   restoration actions. The methodology is based on a balance between local
   demand (physical variables) and supply (forest characteristics) of
   water-related services. This balance has the advantage of showing the
   amount of forest that currently has potential to provide services and
   the areas with higher deficit of services. Although this method still

   methodology a rapid assessment of forest potential to provide

AB Introduction: Due to the budget limitations, laboratories mostly rely on
   the manufacturers' information about the influence of interfering
   substances on laboratory results. However, some manufacturers do not
   follow the recommended procedures for testing interferences (CLSI
   standard) and there is a great variability in the presentation of data
   regarding lipemia interference.
   Materials and methods: We aimed to verify the manufacturers'
   specifications for lipemia interference for clinical chemistry reagents
   provided by Beckman Coulter, Roche and Siemens. Bias was determined
   using the Intralipid simulated lipemic samples. Furthermore, we aimed to
   compare obtained data with the manufacturers' claims and desirable
   specification for imprecision derived from biological variation.
   Results: i) Manufacturers' declarations were not confirmed for all three
   manufacturers; ii) the magnitude and direction of the effect of lipemia
   on laboratory results differ substantially between the three tested
   analytical systems; and iii) manufacturers are using arbitrary limits in
   declaring the expected effect of interference on laboratory results.
   Conclusions: There is an urgent need to standardize the way
   manufacturers test and report their data on the lipemia interference. We
   propose that, instead of arbitrary limits, manufacturers use evidence
   based quality specifications for assessing the allowable biases.
   Moreover, laboratories should be aware of the possible lack of
   replicability of manufacturers' declarations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

   benefit of using SPs is the opportunity to provide a standardized method
   by which students can demonstrate and develop their competency.
   Relatively little is known, however, about the capacity of SPs to offer
   an accurate and standardized performance across a speech-language
   therapy student cohort.
   AimsTo investigate the accuracy, reproducibility (consistent performance
   of each SP across student interviews) and replicability (consistent
   performance of a number of SPs across each scenario) of SPs portraying
   three scenarios, each as a parent of a child presenting with a speech
   disorder.
   Methods & ProceduresForty-four speech-language therapy students
   interviewed four SPs to gain a case history. All interviews were
   videotaped. The accuracy of SP portrayal of key features of each
   scenario was scored by an expert rater and two other raters. Data were
   analysed to determine levels of accuracy, reproducibility and
   replicability, and inter-rater reliability was evaluated.
   Outcomes & ResultsSPs were found to have moderate to high levels of
   accuracy across the three scenarios. There were no significant
   differences in the performances of each individual SP across interviews
   or between all SPs on each scenario, indicating that reproducibility and
   replicability were achieved. Overall inter-rater reliability between
   raters across all scenarios was greater than 80%.
   Conclusions & ImplicationsThe results would seem to indicate that SPs
   can present in a standardized manner within a speech-language therapy
   context, confirming the value of their inclusion in clinical education
   programmes. Suggestions for improving the training of SPs in order to
   maintain accuracy are highlighted.

AB The global health burden engendered by human immunodeficiency virus
   (HIV)-induced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a sobering
   reminder of the pressing need for a preventative vaccine. In non-human
   primate models replicating adenovirus (Ad)-HIV/SIV recombinant vaccine
   vectors have been shown to stimulate potent immune responses culminating
   in protection against challenge exposures. Nonetheless, an increase in
   the transgene carrying capacity of these Ad vectors, currently limited
   to approximately 3000 base pairs, would greatly enhance their utility.
   Using a replicating, E3-deleted Ad type 5 host range mutant (Ad5 hr)
   encoding full-length single-chain HIV(BaL)gp120 linked to the D1 and D2
   domains of rhesus macaque CD4 (rhFLSC) we systematically deleted the
   genes encoding early region 4 open reading frame 1 (E4orf1) through
   E4orf4. All the Ad-rhFLSC vectors produced similar levels of viral
   progeny. Cell cycle analysis of infected human and monkey cells revealed
   no differences in virus-host interaction. The parental and E4-deleted
   viruses expressed comparable levels of the transgene with kinetics
   similar to Ad late proteins. Similar levels of cellular immune responses
   and transgene-specific antibodies were elicited in vaccinated mice.
   However, differences in recognition of Ad proteins and induced antibody
   subtypes were observed, suggesting that the E4 gene products might
   modulate antibody responses by as yet unknown mechanisms. In short, we
   have improved the transgene carrying capacity by one thousand base pairs
   while preserving the replicability, levels of transgene expression, and
   immunogenicity critical to these vaccine vectors. This additional space
   allows for flexibility in vaccine design that could not be obtained with
   the current vector and as such should facilitate the goal of improving
   vaccine efficacy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report
   describing the effects of these E4 deletions on transgene expression and
   immunogenicity in a replicating Ad vector.

AB The promise of `big data' has generated a significant deal of interest
   in the development of new approaches to research in the humanities and
   social sciences, as well as a range of important critical interventions
   which warn of an unquestioned rush to `big data'. Drawing on the
   experiences made in developing innovative `big data' approaches to
   social media research, this paper examines some of the repercussions for
   the scholarly research and publication practices of those researchers
   who do pursue the path of `big data'-centric investigation in their
   work. As researchers import the tools and methods of highly
   quantitative, statistical analysis from the `hard' sciences into
   computational, digital humanities research, must they also subscribe to
   the language and assumptions underlying such `scientificity'? If so, how
   does this affect the choices made in gathering, processing, analysing,
   and disseminating the outcomes of digital humanities research? In
   particular, is there a need to rethink the forms and formats of
   publishing scholarly work in order to enable the rigorous scrutiny and
   replicability of research outcomes?

AB Less-invasive biomarkers for early Alzheimer disease (AD) are urgently
   needed. The present study aimed to establish a panel of plasma proteins
   that accurately distinguishes early AD from physiological aging and to
   compare the findings with previous reports. Fifty-eight healthy controls
   (CON) and 109 patients with AD dementia were randomly split into a
   training (40%) and a test (60%) sample. Significant proteins to
   differentiate between the CON and AD dementia groups were identified in
   a comprehensive panel of 107 plasma analytes in the training sample; the
   accuracy in differentiating these 2 groups was explored in the test
   sample. A set of 5 plasma proteins was identified, which differentiated
   between the CON group and the AD dementia group with a sensitivity of
   89.36% and a specificity of 79.17%. A biological pathway analysis showed
   that 4 of 5 proteins belonged to a common network with amyloid precursor
   protein and tau. Apolipoprotein E was the only protein that was both
   significant in the present report and in a previous proteomic study. The
   study provides a piece of evidence in support of the feasibility of a
   blood-based biomarker approach in AD diagnostics; however, further
   research is required because of issues with replicability.

AB Objective. There is an unacceptable delay in the diagnosis of axial
   spondyloarthritis (axSpA) in its early stages among patients at high
   risk, in particular those with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our
   objectives were to develop a sensible and reliable questionnaire to
   identify undetected axSpA among patients with IBD.
   Methods. Literature was reviewed for item generation in the Toronto
   axSpA Questionnaire on IBD (TASQ-IBD). Sensibility of the questionnaire
   was assessed among healthcare professionals and patients. This
   assessment was related to purpose and framework (clinical function,
   clinical justification, and clinical applicability), face validity,
   comprehensiveness [oligo-variability (limiting the questionnaire to
   important items) and transparency], replicability, content validity, and
   feasibility. The test-retest reliability study was administered to 77
   patients with established IBD and axSpA. Kappa agreement coefficients
   and absolute agreement were calculated for items.
   Results. Three domains included IBD, inflammatory back symptoms, and
   extraaxial features. The entry criterion required a patient to have IBD
   and back pain or stiffness that ever persisted for >= 3 months.
   Iterative sensibility assessment involved 16 items and a diagram of the
   back. Kappa coefficients ranged from 0.81-1.00 for each item. Absolute
   agreement across all items ranged from 91% to 100%.
   Conclusion. TASQ-IBD is a newly developed, sensible, and reliable
   case-finding questionnaire to be administered to patients with IBD who
   have ever had chronic back pain or stiffness persisting for >= 3 months.
   It should facilitate identification and timely referral of patients with
   IBD to rheumatologists and minimize the delay in diagnosis of axSpA.
   Consequently, it should assess the prevalence of axSpA in IBD.

AB This paper reports recent developments in Rapfish, a normative, scalable
   and flexible rapid appraisal technique that integrates both ecological
   and human dimensions to evaluate the status of fisheries in reference to
   a norm or goal. Appraisal status targets may be sustainability,
   compliance with a standard (such as the UN code of conduct for
   responsible fisheries) or the degree of progress in meeting some other
   goal or target. The method combines semi-quantitative (e.g. ecological)
   and qualitative (e.g. social) data via multiple evaluation fields, each
   of which is assessed through scores assigned to six to 12 attributes or
   indicators: the scoring method allows user flexibility to adopt a wide
   range of utility relationships. For assessing sustainability, six
   evaluation fields have been developed: ecological, technological,
   economic, social, ethical and institutional. Each field can be assessed
   directly with a set of scored attributes, or several of the fields can
   be dealt with in greater detail using nested subfields that themselves
   comprise multidimensional Rapfish assessments (e.g. the hierarchical
   institutional field encompasses both governance and management,
   including a detailed analysis of legality). The user has the choice of
   including all or only some of the available sustainability fields. For
   the attributes themselves, there will rarely be quantitative data, but
   scoring allows these items to be estimated. Indeed, within a normative
   framework, one important advantage with Rapfish is transparency of the
   rigour, quality and replicability of the scores. The Rapfish technique
   employs a constrained multidimensional ordination that is scaled to
   situate data points within evaluation space. Within each evaluation
   field, results may be presented as a two-dimensional plot or in a
   one-dimensional rank order. Uncertainty is expressed through the
   probability distribution of Monte-Carlo simulations that use the c.l. on
   each original observation. Overall results of the multidisciplinary
   analysis may be shown using kite diagrams that compare different
   locations, time periods (including future projections) and management
   scenarios, which make policy trade-offs explicit. These enhancements are
   now available in the R programming language and on an open website,
   where users can run Rapfish analyses by downloading the software or
   uploading their data to a user interface. (C) 2013 The Authors Journal

   assessment in both high stakes and classroom contexts. However, because
   of the vague definition of what constitutes an integrated task, the
   types of tasks included in this area and the assessment of the resulting
   writing is highly varied. In this paper, we argue for a better
   definition of the term 'integrated writing task'. We start by reviewing
   current definitions available in the literature, discuss the construct
   underlying integrated tasks and then propose a number of features which
   we feel need to be present in integrated tasks. We then propose a new,
   narrower definition of the term. We hope that this will result in better
   task design, improved assessment outcomes for test takers, more detailed
   test specifications, better replicability of research and a shared
   research agenda. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   independently. The robot's flexibility and open coding system (g-code)
   make it capable of performing custom tasks that are not supported by
   commercial systems. Its applications include, but are not limited to,
   drilling holes, sharp edge craniotomies, skull thinning, and lowering
   electrodes or cannula. In order to expedite the writing of g-coding for
   simple surgeries, we have developed custom scripts that allow
   individuals to design a surgery with no knowledge of programming.
   However, for users to get the most out of the motorized stereotax, it
   would be beneficial to be knowledgeable in mathematical programming and
   G-Coding (simple programming for CNC machining).
   The recommended drill speed is greater than 40,000 rpm. The stepper
   motor resolution is 1.8 degrees/Step, geared to 0.346 degrees/Step. A
   standard stereotax has a resolution of 2.88 degrees m/step. The maximum
   recommended cutting speed is 500 mu m/sec. The maximum recommended

AB We present new data on the prevalence and patterning of the maxillary
   premolar accessory ridge (MxPAR), a common but understudied
   morphological dental trait that is expressed as a linear elevation
   extending from the buccal cusp ridge to the medial sulcus of maxillary
   premolar teeth. A total of 579 sets of dental casts, representing six
   ethnic groups, were scored using the five-grade system proposed by
   Burnett et al. (2010). The frequency and distribution of the MxPAR were
   determined by tooth type, sex, side, locus and ethnicity, and the
   applicability of the scoring system was assessed. The MxPAR was found in
   approximately two-thirds of premolar teeth, more often on second than
   first premolars, and more often on the distal aspect of the occlusal
   surface than the mesial. There was some evidence that more pronounced
   forms of the feature occurred more often in males than females, and that
   there may be some directionality in its expression between sides.
   Variation was also noted in the frequency of occurrence and degree of
   expression of the MxPAR between ethnic groups. Intra- and inter-observer
   concordance rates for scoring the MxPAR were low, confirming that it was
   difficult to score the trait identically on two different occasions. Our
   findings have clarified the distribution of the MxPAR within the
   dentition and between ethnic groups, and highlighted the need for
   researchers to carry out thorough replicability studies and to decide on
   an appropriate breakpoint for determining presence or absence of this
   feature before embarking on genetic studies or bio-distance analyses.

AB In this article, we address the current state and general role of
   replication in empirical sciences in general and music psychology in
   particular. We argue that replication should be an integral part of the
   quality management of science because it helps to improve and maintain
   the general benefit of empirical sciences by enhancing the confidence in
   scientific phenomena and theories. Replicating empirical experiments has
   two major benefits: (1) It increases the sheer number of observations
   and (2) it provides independent evidence which works as a safety net
   against methodological fallacies, causally influential but unknown
   (i.e., random) factors, researcher degrees of freedom, and outright
   fraud. Furthermore, we argue that for low-gain/low-cost sciences such as
   music psychology, measures to ensure quality standards, in particular
   the amount of replication experiments conducted, can be expected to be
   lower than in high gain/high cost sciences. These lower expectations
   stem from the general acknowledgments that in low-gain/low-cost sciences
   (1) research resources are normally scarce and (2) the consequences of
   inadequate theories are relatively harmless. We argue that the view of
   music psychology as a low-cost/low-gain science can explain the striking
   lack of replication studies and meta-analyses. We also discuss possible
   counter-measures to enhance the reliability of music-psychological
   knowledge.

   American (58%) and White (42%) urban dwellers living above (49%) and
   below (51%) 125% of the federal poverty line. The NEO-PI-R, administered
   via telephone, was evaluated for data quality (percent valid,
   acquiescence, internal consistency), congruence with the normative
   factor structure, and readability. All indices of data quality and
   factor congruence were excellent in the full sample. Literacy was the
   most consistent predictor of data quality. A slightly worse structure
   was found for the Openness to Experience and Extraversion factors among
   lower socioeconomic status African American and White participants. The
   overall index of factor congruence, however, supports replication of the
   normative structure well beyond chance levels even among those with
   lower literacy. Despite the challenges of low literacy, the present
   findings indicate that personality traits can be assessed reliably in

AB This article explores an agenda towards post-carbon cities, extending
   and deepening established debates around low-carbon, sustainable cities
   in the process. The label post-carbon builds upon issues beyond those of
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy conservation and climate change,
   adding a broader set of concerns, including economic justice, behaviour
   change, wellbeing, land ownership, the role of capital and the state,
   and community self-management. The article draws upon a case study of an
   embryonic post-carbon initiative completed in early 2013 called Lilac.
   Based in Leeds, Lilac stands for Low Impact Living Affordable Community
   and is the first attempt to build an affordable, ecological cohousing
   project in the UK. Its three aspects each respond to significant
   challenges: low-impact living and the challenge of post-carbon value
   change; affordability and the challenge of mutualism and equality; and
   community and the challenge of self-governance. I conclude the article
   by exploring six lessons from Lilac that tentatively outline a roadmap
   towards post-carbon cities: the need for holistic approaches that deal
   with complex challenges, prioritizing self-determination rather than
   just participation, engaging with productive political tensions,
   adopting a process rather than an outcomes-based approach, developing
   strategy for replicability, and finally, embracing a non-parochial
   approach to localities.

AB Rule learning algorithms, for example, RIPPER, induces univariate rules,
   that is, a propositional condition in a rule uses only one feature. In
   this paper, we propose an omnivariate induction of rules where under
   each condition, both a univariate and a multivariate condition are
   trained, and the best is chosen according to a novel statistical test.
   This paper has three main contributions: First, we propose a novel
   statistical test, the combined 5 x 2 cv t test, to compare two
   classifiers, which is a variant of the 5 x 2 cv t test and give the
   connections to other tests as 5 x 2 cv F test and k-fold paired t test.
   Second, we propose a multivariate version of RIPPER, where support
   vector machine with linear kernel is used to find multivariate linear
   conditions. Third, we propose an omnivariate version of RIPPER, where
   the model selection is done via the combined 5 x 2 cv t test. Our
   results indicate that 1) the combined 5 x 2 cv t test has higher power
   (lower type II error), lower type I error, and higher replicability
   compared to the 5 x 2 cv t test, 2) omnivariate rules are better in that
   they choose whichever condition is more accurate, selecting the right
   model automatically and separately for each condition in a rule.

AB Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a well-known neurodegenerative disease that
   is associated with dramatic morphological abnormalities. The default
   mode network (DMN) is one of the most frequently studied resting-state
   networks. However, less is known about specific structural dependency or
   interactions among brain regions within the DMN in AD. In this study, we
   performed a Bayesian network (BN) analysis based on regional grey matter
   volumes to identify differences in structural interactions among core
   DMN regions in structural MRI data from 80 AD patients and 101 normal
   controls (NC). Compared to NC, the structural interactions between the
   medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and other brain regions, including the
   left inferior parietal cortex (IPC), the left inferior temporal cortex
   (ITC) and the right hippocampus (HP), were significantly reduced in the
   AD group. In addition, the AD group showed prominent increases in
   structural interactions from the left ITC to the left HP, the left HP to
   the right ITC, the right HP to the right ITC, and the right IPC to the
   posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). The BN models significantly
   distinguished AD patients from NC with 87.12% specificity and 81.25%
   sensitivity. We then used the derived BN models to examine the
   replicability and stability of AD-associated BN models in an independent
   dataset and the results indicated discriminability with 83.64%
   specificity and 80.49% sensitivity. The results revealed that the BN
   analysis was effective for characterising regional structure
   interactions and the AD-related BN models could be considered as valid
   and predictive structural brain biomarker models for AD. Therefore, our
   study can assist in further understanding the pathological mechanism of
   AD, based on the view of the structural network, and may provide new
   insights into classification and clinical application in the study of AD
   in the future.

AB The effect of mild depression on time estimation and production was
   investigated. Participants made both magnitude estimation and magnitude
   production judgments for five time intervals (specified in seconds) from
   3 sec to 65 sec. The parameters of the best fitting psychophysical
   function (power law exponent, intercept, and threshold) were determined
   individually for each participant in every condition. There were no
   significant effects of mood (high BDI, low BDI) or judgment (estimation,
   production) on the mean exponent, n = .98, 95% confidence interval
   (.96-1.04) or on the threshold. However, the intercept showed a
   'depressive realism' effect, where high BDI participants had a smaller
   deviation from accuracy and a smaller difference between estimation and
   judgment than low BDI participants. Accuracy bias was assessed using
   three measures of accuracy: difference, defined as psychological time
   minus physical time, ratio, defined as psychological time divided by
   physical time, and a new logarithmic accuracy measure defined as In
   (ratio). The In (ratio) measure was shown to have approximately normal
   residuals when subjected to a mixed ANOVA with mood as a between groups
   explanatory factor and judgment and time category as repeated measures
   explanatory factors. The residuals of the other two accuracy measures
   flagrantly violated normality. The mixed ANOVAs of accuracy also showed
   a strong depressive realism effect, just like the intercepts of the
   psychophysical functions. There was also a strong negative correlation
   between estimation and production judgments. Taken together these
   findings support a clock model of time estimation, combined with
   additional cognitive mechanisms to account for the depressive realism
   effect. The findings also suggest strong methodological recommendations.

   recently developed for the differentiation of hES/iPS cells into the
   authentic human striatal projection medium spiny neurons (MSNs) that die
   in Huntington's Disease (HD). Authenticity is judged by the convergence
   of multiple features within individual cells. Our procedure lasts 80
   days and couples neural induction via BMP/TGF-beta inhibition with
   exposure to the developmental factors sonic hedgehog (SHH) and dickkopf1
   (DKK-1) to drive ventral telencephalic specification, followed by
   terminal differentiation [1]. Authenticity of the resulting neuronal
   population is monitored by the appearance of FOXG1(+)/GSX2(+) progenitor
   cells of the lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) at day 15-25 of
   differentiation, followed by appearance of CTIP2-, FOXP1- and
   FOXP2-positive cells at day 45. These precursor cells then mature into
   MAP2(+)/GABA(+) neurons with 20 % of them ultimately co-expressing the
   DARPP-32 and CTIP2 diagnostic markers and carrying electrophysiological
   properties expected for fully functional MSNs.The protocol is
   characterized by its replicability in at least three human pluripotent
   cell lines. Altogether this protocol defines a useful platform for in
   vitro developmental neurobiology studies, drug screening, and
   regenerative medicine approaches.

AB On forested paths, dendrogeomorphology has been demonstrated to
   represent a powerful tool to reconstruct past activity of avalanches, an
   indispensable step in avalanche hazard assessment. Several quantitative
   and qualitative approaches have been shown to yield reasonable event
   chronologies but the question of the completeness of tree-ring records
   remains debatable. Here, we present an alternative semi-quantitative
   approach for the determination of past snow avalanche events. The
   approach relies on the assessment of the number and position of
   disturbed trees within avalanche paths as well as on the intensity of
   reactions in trees. In order to demonstrate that no bias was induced by
   the dendrogeomorphic expert, we cany out a statistical evaluation
   (Classification and Regression Trees, or CART) of the approach. Results
   point to the consistency and replicability of the procedure and to the
   fact that the approach is not restricted to the identification of
   high-magnitude avalanches. Evaluation of the semi-quantitative approach
   is illustrated on a well-documented path in Chamonix, French Alps. For
   the period 1905-2010, comparison between the avalanche years recorded in
   a substantial database (Enquete Permanente sur les Avalanches, or EPA)
   and those defined with dendrogeomorphic techniques shows that the
   avalanche record reconstructed from tree-ring series contains 38% of the
   observed events.

AB Most people want to know how they can improve their health by
   implementation of a proper diet. Therefore nutritional epidemiology
   studies, which correlate the intake of specific nutrients, food items,
   or dietary patterns with health outcomes, receive substantial interest
   in the media. However, the results of many nutritional epidemiology
   studies have not been replicated in subsequent studies. This paper
   reviews the primary methodological problems in nutritional epidemiology
   that result in lack of replicability and inconsistency across studies.
   The problematic methodological issues include substantial measurement
   error, confounding, the variable effects of food items, variable
   reference groups, interactions, and multiple testing.

AB Palliative care in the U.S. has evolved from a system primarily reliant
   on community-based hospices to a combined model that includes inpatient
   services at most large hospitals. However, these two dominant approaches
   leave most patients needing palliative care-those at home (including
   nursing homes) but not yet ready for hospice-unable to access the
   positive impacts of the palliative care approach. We propose a
   community-based palliative care (CPC) model that spans the array of
   inpatient and outpatient settings in which palliative care is provided
   and links seamlessly to inpatient care; likewise, it would span the full
   trajectory of advanced illness rather than focusing on the period just
   before death. Examples of CPC programs are developing organically across
   the U.S. As our understanding of CPC expands, standardization is needed
   to ensure replicability, consistency, and the ability to relate
   intervention models to outcomes. A growing body of literature examining
   outpatient palliative care supports the role of CPC in improving
   outcomes, including reduction in symptom burden, improved quality of
   life, increased survival, better satisfaction with care, and reduced
   health care resource utilization. Furthermore the examination of how to
   operationalize CPC is needed before widespread implementation can be
   realized. This article describes the key characteristics of CPC,
   highlighting its role in longitudinal care across patient transitions.
   Distinguishing features include consistent care across the disease
   trajectory independent of diagnosis and prognosis; inclusion of
   inpatient, outpatient, long-term care, and at-home care delivery;
   collaboration with other medical disciplines, nursing, and allied
   health; and full integration into the health care system (rather than
   parallel delivery). J Pain Symptom Manage 2013;46:254-264. (C) 2013 U.S.

AB Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the most commonly used controller
   medications prescribed for asthma. Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms
   (SNPs), rs1876828 in corticotrophin releasing hormone receptor 1 and
   rs37973 in GLCCI1, have previously been associated with corticosteroid
   efficacy. We studied data from four existing clinical trials of
   asthmatics, who received ICS and had lung function measured by forced
   expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) before and after the period of such
   treatment. We combined the two SNPs rs37973 and rs1876828 into a
   predictive test of FEV1 change using a Bayesian model, which identified
   patients with good or poor steroid response (highest or lowest quartile,
   respectively) with predictive performance of 65.7% (P=0.039 vs random)
   area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve in the training
   population and 65.9% (P=0.025 vs random) in the test population. These
   findings show that two genetic variants can be combined into a
   predictive test that achieves similar accuracy and superior
   replicability compared with single SNP predictors.

   and collectivism constructs, suggesting that these two instruments
   assess individualism and collectivism differently.

AB Functional images of the resting brain can be empirically parsed into
   intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) which closely resemble patterns
   of evoked task-based brain activity and which have a biological and
   genetic basis. Recently, ICNs have become popular for investigating
   brain functioning and brain-behavior relationships. However, the
   replicability and neurometrics of these networks are only beginning to
   be reported. Using a meta-level independent component analysis (ICA), we
   produced ICNs from three data sets collected from two samples of healthy
   adults. The ICNs from our data sets demonstrated robust and independent
   replication of 12 intrinsic networks that reflected 17 canonical,
   task-based, brain networks. We found within-subject reliability of ICNs
   was modest overall, but ranged from poor to good, and that voxels with
   the highest measured connectivity rarely had the highest reliability.
   Networks associated with executive functions, visuospatial reasoning,
   motor coordination, speech and audition, default mode, vision, and
   interoception showed moderate to high group-level reproducibility and
   replicability. However, only the first four of these networks also
   showed fair or better within-subject reliability over time. Our findings
   highlight the replicability of ICNs across data sets, the range of
   within-subject neurometrics across different networks, and the shared
   characteristics between resting and task-based networks. (C) 2013

AB The existence of seasonal or circannual effects on laboratory rodent
   behavior has been the subject of much debate in recent conversations
   with colleagues. If such effects are real, they could explain poor
   replicability or hinder the detection of treatment effects. Here, we
   review the literature in which seasonal or circannual rhythms were
   examined under typical 12:12 h photoperiods and present our historical
   data of locomotor activity of male and female Sprague-Dawley rats across
   several seasons and years. In general, there was little evidence to
   indicate significant effects on the locomotor activity of rats or mice,
   while studies of depression behaviors were somewhat inconsistent in
   their findings. Results of the few anxiety behavior assessments were
   fairly consistent, at least in rat studies. Two studies of pain-related
   behaviors indicated decreased responses during spring or summer testing.
   If such seasonal effects are real, this would imply that laboratory
   rodents have a type of internal Type 2 circannual clock or endogenous
   oscillator. However, photoperiod, temperature, or humidity cannot be the
   zeitgeber. Further, the need for a circannual clock in a short-lived
   rodent is debatable. Published by Elsevier Inc.

   age, weight, and hormone therapy, had a sensitivity of 91.2 %, a
   specificity of 50.6 %, and an AUC of 0.709 with a specific cut-off score
   of -9. Comparable results were shown in the validation dataset:
   sensitivity 84.8 %, specificity 51.6 %, and AUC 0.682. Additionally,
   risk categorization with KORAM showed improved reclassification over
   that of OSTA from 7.4 to 41.7 %. KORAM can be easily used as a
   pre-screening tool to identify candidates for DXA tests. Further studies
   investigating cost-effectiveness and replicability in other datasets are
   required to establish the clinical utility of KORAM.

AB There is currently an unprecedented level of doubt regarding the
   reliability of research findings in psychology. Many recommendations
   have been made to improve the current situation. In this article, we
   report results from PsychDisclosure.org, a novel open-science initiative
   that provides a platform for authors of recently published articles to
   disclose four methodological design specification details that are not
   required to be disclosed under current reporting standards but that are
   critical for accurate interpretation and evaluation of reported
   findings. Grassroots sentimentas manifested in the positive and
   appreciative response to our initiativeindicates that psychologists want
   to see changes made at the systemic level regarding disclosure of such
   methodological details. Almost 50% of contacted researchers disclosed
   the requested design specifications for the four methodological
   categories (excluded subjects, nonreported conditions and measures, and
   sample size determination). Disclosed information provided by
   participating authors also revealed several instances of questionable
   editorial practices, which need to be thoroughly examined and redressed.
   On the basis of these results, we argue that the time is now for
   mandatory methods disclosure statements for all psychology journals,
   which would be an important step forward in improving the reliability of
   findings in psychology.

AB In recent years the topic of entrepreneurship has become a major focus
   in the social sciences, with renewed interest in the links between
   personality and entrepreneurship. Taking a socioecological perspective
   to psychology, which emphasizes the role of social habitats and their
   interactions with mind and behavior, we investigated regional variation
   in and correlates of an entrepreneurship-prone Big Five profile.
   Specifically, we analyzed personality data collected from over half a
   million U.S. residents (N = 619,397) as well as public archival data on
   state-level entrepreneurial activity (i.e., business-creation and
   self-employment rates). Results revealed that an entrepreneurship-prone
   personality profile is regionally clustered. This geographical
   distribution corresponds to the pattern that can be observed when
   mapping entrepreneurial activity across the United States. Indeed, the
   state-level correlation (N = 51) between an entrepreneurial personality
   structure and entrepreneurial activity was positive in direction,
   substantial in magnitude, and robust even when controlling for regional
   economic prosperity. These correlations persisted at the level of U.S.
   metropolitan statistical areas (N = 15) and were replicated in
   independent German (N = 19,842; 14 regions) and British (N = 15,617; 12
   regions) samples. In contrast to these profile-based analyses, an
   analysis linking the individual Big Five dimensions to regional measures
   of entrepreneurial activity did not yield consistent findings.
   Discussion focuses on the implications of these findings for
   interdisciplinary theory development and practical applications.

AB ScriptingRT is a new open source tool to collect response latencies in
   online studies of human cognition. ScriptingRT studies run as Flash
   applets in enabled browsers. ScriptingRT provides the building blocks of
   response latency studies, which are then combined with generic Apache
   Flex programming. Six studies evaluate the performance of ScriptingRT
   empirically. Studies 1-3 use specialized hardware to measure variance of
   response time measurement and stimulus presentation timing. Studies 4-6
   implement a Stroop paradigm and run it both online and in the
   laboratory, comparing ScriptingRT to other response latency software.
   Altogether, the studies show that Flash programs developed in
   ScriptingRT show a small lag and an increased variance in response
   latencies. However, this did not significantly influence measured
   effects: The Stroop effect was reliably replicated in all studies, and
   the found effects did not depend on the software used. We conclude that
   ScriptingRT can be used to test response latency effects online.

AB Background: An incremental, loosely planned development approach is
   often used in bioinformatic studies when dealing with custom data
   analysis in a rapidly changing environment. Unfortunately, the lack of a
   rigorous software structuring can undermine the maintainability,
   communicability and replicability of the process. To ameliorate this
   problem we propose the Leaf system, the aim of which is to seamlessly
   introduce the pipeline formality on top of a dynamical development
   process with minimum overhead for the programmer, thus providing a
   simple layer of software structuring.
   Results: Leaf includes a formal language for the definition of pipelines
   with code that can be transparently inserted into the user's Python
   code. Its syntax is designed to visually highlight dependencies in the
   pipeline structure it defines. While encouraging the developer to think
   in terms of bioinformatic pipelines, Leaf supports a number of automated
   features including data and session persistence, consistency checks
   between steps of the analysis, processing optimization and publication
   of the analytic protocol in the form of a hypertext.
   Conclusions: Leaf offers a powerful balance between plan-driven and
   change-driven development environments in the design, management and
   communication of bioinformatic pipelines. Its unique features make it a
   valuable alternative to other related tools.

AB Concerns exist within the medical and psychological sciences that many
   published research findings are not replicable. Guidelines accordingly
   recommend that the file drawer effect should be eliminated and that
   statistical significance should not be a criterion in the decision to
   submit and publish scientific results. By means of a simulation study,
   we show that selectively publishing effects that differ significantly
   from the cumulative meta-analytic effect evokes the Proteus phenomenon
   of poorly replicable and alternating findings. However, the simulation
   also shows that the selective publication approach yields a scientific
   record that is content rich as compared to publishing everything, in the
   sense that fewer publications are needed for obtaining an accurate
   meta-analytic estimation of the true effect. We conclude that, under the
   assumption of self-correcting science, the file drawer effect can be
   beneficial for the scientific collective.

AB Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have detected many disease
   associations. However, the reported variants tend to explain small
   fractions of risk, and there are doubts about issues such as the
   portability of findings over different ethnic groups or the relative
   roles of rare versus common variants in the genetic architecture of
   complex disease. Studying the degree of sharing of disease-associated
   variants across populations can help in solving these issues. We present
   a comprehensive survey of GWAS replicability across 28 diseases. Most
   loci and SNPs discovered in Europeans for these conditions have been
   extensively replicated using peoples of European and East Asian
   ancestry, while the replication with individuals of African ancestry is
   much less common. We found a strong and significant correlation of Odds
   Ratios across Europeans and East Asians, indicating that underlying
   causal variants are common and shared between the two ancestries.
   Moreover, SNPs that failed to replicate in East Asians map into genomic
   regions where Linkage Disequilibrium patterns differ significantly
   between populations. Finally, we observed that GWAS with larger sample
   sizes have detected variants with weaker effects rather than with lower
   frequencies. Our results indicate that most GWAS results are due to
   common variants. In addition, the sharing of disease alleles and the
   high correlation in their effect sizes suggest that most of the
   underlying causal variants are shared between Europeans and East Asians
   and that they tend to map close to the associated marker SNPs.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship
   between typically measured prenatal screening biomarkers and
   early-preterm birth in euploid pregnancies.
   STUDY DESIGN: The study included 345 early-preterm cases (<30 weeks of
   gestation) and 1725 control subjects who were drawn from a
   population-based sample of California pregnancies who had both first-
   and second-trimester screening results. Logistic regression analyses
   were used to compare patterns of biomarkers in cases and control
   subjects and to develop predictive models. Replicability of the
   biomarker early-preterm relationships that was revealed by the models
   was evaluated by examination of the frequency and associated adjusted
   relative risks (RRs) for early-preterm birth and for preterm birth in
   general (<37 weeks of gestation) in pregnancies with identified abnormal
   markers compared with pregnancies without these markers in a subsequent
   independent California cohort of screened pregnancies (n = 76,588).
   RESULTS: The final model for early-preterm birth included
   first-trimester pregnancy-associated plasma protein A in the <= 5th
   percentile, second-trimester alpha-fetoprotein in the >= 95th
   percentile, and second-trimester inhibin in the >= 95th percentile (odds
   ratios, 2.3-3.6). In general, pregnancies in the subsequent cohort with
   a biomarker pattern that were found to be associated with early-preterm
   delivery in the first sample were at an increased risk for early-preterm
   birth and preterm birth in general (<37 weeks of gestation; adjusted RR,
   1.6-27.4). Pregnancies with >= 2 biomarker abnormalities were at
   particularly increased risk (adjusted RR, 3.6-27.4).
   CONCLUSION: When considered across cohorts and in combination,
   abnormalities in routinely collected biomarkers reveal predictable risks
   for early-preterm birth.

AB We report on the development of a life sciences curriculum, targeted to
   undergraduate students, which was modeled after a commercially available
   physics curriculum and based on aspects of how people learn. Our paper
   describes the collaborative development process and necessary
   modifications required to apply a physics pedagogical model in a life
   sciences context. While some approaches were easily adapted, others
   provided significant challenges. Among these challenges were:
   representations of energy, introducing definitions, the placement of
   Scientists' Ideas, and the replicability of data. In modifying the
   curriculum to address these challenges, we have come to see them as
   speaking to deeper differences between the disciplines, namely that
   introductory physics-for example, Newton's laws, magnetism, light-is a
   science of pairwise interaction, while introductory biology-for example,
   photosynthesis, evolution, cycling of matter in ecosystems-is a science
   of linked processes, and we suggest that this is how the two disciplines
   are presented in introductory classes. We illustrate this tension
   through an analysis of our adaptations of the physics curriculum for
   instruction on the cycling of matter and energy; we show that
   modifications of the physics curriculum to address the biological
   framework promotes strong gains in student understanding of these
   topics, as evidenced by analysis of student work.

   helps achieve the aims set forth in MARS. Examples of best practices are
   provided to aid readers in finding models for their own research.
   Meta-analytic reviews are a primary avenue for the accumulation of
   knowledge in the organizational sciences as well as many other areas of
   science. Unfortunately, many meta-analytic reviews in the organizational
   sciences do not fully follow professional guidelines and standards as
   closely as they should. Such deviations from best practice undermine the
   transparency and replicability of the reviews and thus their usefulness
   for the generation of cumulative knowledge and evidence-based practice.
   This study shows how implementing "best" meta-analytic practices helps
   to achieve the aims set forth in MARS. Although the paper is written
   primarily for organizational scientists, the paper's recommendations are

AB A growing number of structural neuroimaging studies have reported
   significant changes in gray matter density or volume and white matter
   microstructure in the adult human brain following training. Such reports
   appear consistent with animal studies of training-dependent structural
   plasticity showing changes in, for example, dendritic spines. However,
   given the microscopic nature of these changes in animals and the
   relatively low spatial resolution of MRI, it is unclear that such
   changes can be reliably detected in humans. Here, we critically evaluate
   the robustness of the current evidence in humans, focusing on the
   specificity, replicability, and the relationship of the reported changes
   with behavior. We find that limitations of experimental design,
   statistical methods, and methodological artifacts may underlie many of
   the reported effects, seriously undermining the evidence for
   training-dependent structural changes in adult humans. The most robust
   evidence, showing specificity of structural changes to training, task
   and brain region, shows changes in anterior hippocampal volume with
   exercise in elderly participants. We conclude that more compelling
   evidence and converging data from animal studies is required to
   substantiate structural changes in the adult human brain with training,
   especially in the neocortex. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The development of successful treatments for humans after traumatic
   brain or spinal cord injuries (TBI and SCI, respectively) requires
   animal research. This effort can be hampered when promising experimental
   results cannot be replicated because of incorrect data analysis
   procedures. To identify and hopefully avoid these errors in future
   studies, the articles in seven journals with the highest number of basic
   science central nervous system TBI and SCI animal research studies
   published in 2010 (N = 125 articles) were reviewed for their data
   analysis procedures. After identifying the most common statistical
   errors, the implications of those findings were demonstrated by
   reanalyzing previously published data from our laboratories using the
   identified inappropriate statistical procedures, then comparing the two
   sets of results. Overall, 70% of the articles contained at least one
   type of inappropriate statistical procedure. The highest percentage
   involved incorrect post hoc t-tests (56.4%), followed by inappropriate
   parametric statistics (analysis of variance and t-test; 37.6%). Repeated
   Measures analysis was inappropriately missing in 52.0% of all articles
   and, among those with behavioral assessments, 58% were analyzed
   incorrectly. Reanalysis of our published data using the most common
   inappropriate statistical procedures resulted in a 14.1% average
   increase in significant effects compared to the original results.
   Specifically, an increase of 15.5% occurred with Independent t-tests and
   11.1% after incorrect post hoc t-tests. Utilizing proper statistical
   procedures can allow more-definitive conclusions, facilitate
   replicability of research results, and enable more accurate translation
   of those results to the clinic.

AB NOTCH1 has been found recurrently mutated in a subset of patients with
   chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). To analyze biological features and
   clinical impact of NOTCH1 mutations in CLL, we sequenced this gene in
   565 patients. NOTCH1 mutations, found in 63 patients (11%), were
   associated with unmutated IGHV, high expression of CD38 and ZAP-70,
   trisomy 12, advanced stage and elevated lactate dehydrogenase.
   Sequential analysis in 200 patients demonstrated acquisition of mutation
   in one case (0.5%) and disappearance after treatment in two. Binet A and
   B patients with NOTCH1-mutated had a shorter time to treatment.
   NOTCH1-mutated patients were more frequently refractory to therapy and
   showed shorter progression-free and overall survival after complete
   remission. Overall survival was shorter in NOTCH1-mutated patients,
   although not independently from IGHV. NOTCH1 mutation increased the risk
   of transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma independently from
   IGHV, with this being validated in resampling tests of replicability. In
   summary, NOTCH1 mutational status, that was rarely acquired during the
   course of the disease, identify a genetic subgroup with high risk of
   transformation and poor outcome. This recently identified genetic
   subgroup of CLL patients deserves prospective studies to define their
   best management.

AB Entheseal changes (ECs) have been widely recorded using visual methods,
   but size and shape affect stress distribution which cannot be quantified
   visually. The aim of this paper is to present a simple method for
   quantifying size and shape by applying parameters to quantify shape and
   to highlight preliminary results indicating that this method provides
   useful data. Hypotheses tested were: common extensor origin size
   correlates with humerus size; ECs change the size and shape of entheses;
   surface area is increased in those entheses with bony proliferation. The
   common extensor origins of 43 male skeletons from medieval York were
   recorded. The entheses were recorded visually for any deviation from a
   smooth surface. The chord was measured using sliding calipers and the
   shape of the entheses recorded using a profile gauge and quantified
   using parameters (e.g. the standard deviation of the surface from a mean
   line) which assess the relationship of the surface to a flat surface. To
   test replicability, disarticulated humeri were also recorded
   (inter-observer error n = 9; intra-observer error n = 20) using the same
   methodology. Replicability for size and shape was good for
   intra-observer error but weaker for inter-observer error. There is
   variability in enthesis size and distal humeral condyle size; normal
   entheses are smaller than those with EC while their surface shape
   differs and is affected by the type of EC (proliferative or
   destructive); surface area in those entheses with proliferative ECs is
   increased. The use of these parameters for quantifying enthesis size and
   shape provides insights into enthesis variability which cannot be tested
   using visual methods alone. These parameters can be recorded using this
   two-dimensional method or can be measured on data collected with a laser
   scanner. Future research will test the relationship between surface
   size/shape and the effects of biological sex, age and occupation.

AB Applicability of Terrestrial Laser Scanners/Scanning (TLS) in
   deformation measurement in dams is an active area of study. With the
   advance of modern technology, accuracy of measurements is much improved
   by developments in design of terrestrial laser scanners. Currently, this
   technology is used in large and complex engineering structures such as
   dams. Although TLS is a high cost technology, it is particularly used in
   monitoring of dam deformations, due to its speed in obtaining thousands
   of data points, ability to visualize the scanned object and its
   environment with high accuracy and ability to take long-range
   measurements. In order to determine the effect of change in water
   reservoir levels on body of the dam, TLS are used to take deformation
   measurements in different time intervals, where the water level was at
   maximum, minimum and medium levels. This paper provides an overview of
   terrestrial laser scanning technology for deformation monitoring. The
   concrete arch dam in Antalya Oymapinar, Turkey was used for case study.
   Four different scannings were performed in this dam in order to verify
   the replicability of TLS results on same water levels and equivalent
   conditions. Digital Surface Models reflecting dam surface have been
   created. Results obtained from surface model differences were examined
   using surface matching method.

AB DSM-IV-TR defines four subtypes of bipolar disorder (BP): bipolar I,
   bipolar II, cyclothymic disorder and bipolar not otherwise specified
   (NOS). However, cyclothymic disorder in children is rarely researched,
   or often subsumed in an "NOS" category. The present study tests the
   replicability of findings from an earlier study, and expands on the
   criterion validity of cyclothymic disorder in youth. Using the Robins
   and Guze (1970) framework we examined the validity of cyclothymic
   disorder as a subtype of BP. Using a youth (ages 5-17) outpatient
   clinical sample (N = 894), participants with cyclothymic disorder (n =
   53) were compared to participants with other BP spectrum disorders (n =
   399) and to participants with non-bipolar disorders (n = 442). Analyses
   tested differences in youth with cyclothymic disorder and bipolar
   disorder not otherwise specified who do, and those who do not, have a
   parent with BP. Compared to youth with non-bipolar disorders, youth with
   cyclothymic disorder had higher irritability (p < 0.001), more
   comorbidity (p < 0.001), greater sleep disturbance (p < 0.005), and were
   more likely to have a family history of BP (p < 0.001). Cyclothymic
   disorder was associated with a younger age of onset compared to
   depression (p < 0.001) and bipolar II (p = 0.05). Parental BP status was
   not significantly associated with any variables. Results support that
   cyclothymic disorder belongs on the bipolar spectrum. Epidemiological
   studies indicate that cyclothymic disorder is not uncommon and involves
   significant impairment. Failing to differentiate between cyclothymic
   disorder and bipolar NOS limits our knowledge about a significant
   proportion of cases of bipolarity.

AB Diatoms respond rapidly to eutrophication and diatom-based models for
   inferring total phosphorus (TP) have found wide application in
   palaeolimnology, especially in tracking trajectories of past and recent
   nutrient enrichment and in establishing pre-disturbance targets for
   restoration. Using new analysis of existing training sets and
   sediment-cores we examine the statistical and ecological constraints of
   diatom-inferred TP (DI-TP) models. Although the models show an
   apparently strong relationship between measured and inferred TP in the
   training sets, even under cross-validation, the models display three
   fundamental weaknesses, namely (1) the relationship between TP and
   diatom relative abundance is heavily confounded with secondary variables
   such as alkalinity and lake depth, (2) the models contain many taxa that
   are not significantly related to TP, and (3) comparison between
   different models shows poor or no spatial replicability. At some sites
   the sediment-core diatom assemblage change tracks the TP gradient in the
   training sets and DI-TP reconstructions are consistent with monitored TP
   data and known catchment histories for the recent past. At others diatom
   species turnover is apparently related to variables other than TP, and
   DI-TP fails to even reproduce plausible trends. Pre-disturbance DI-TP
   values are also questionable atmost sites. We argue that these problems
   pervade many DI-TP models, particularly those where violations of the
   basic assumptions of the transfer function approach are ignored.

   shopping, depression, and anxiety In Study 2, temporal stability of the
   SI-R was investigated by administering the scale to 75 participants
   twice with a 4-week interval in between. In Study 3, 452 participants
   completed the SI-R through the internet. Evidence of internal
   consistency, test-retest reliability, construct validity and
   replicability of the original three-correlated-factor structure was
   obtained. After ruling out the bias due to nonrandomized assignment to
   administration methods through propensity matching, multiple-group
   confirmatory factor analyses provided evidence of measurement invariance
   among the administration formats. However, higher latent and manifest
   mean scores were observed in online participants, consistent with the
   "online disinhibition effect." These results suggest that the Italian
   version of the SI-R retains the psychometric properties of the original
   in both the paper-and-pencil and online versions, though different norms

AB BACKGROUND: Self-management is proposed as the standard of care in
   chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but details of the process
   and training required to deliver effective self-management are not
   widely available. In addition, recent data suggest that patient
   engagement and motivation are critical ingredients for effective
   self-management. This article carefully describes a self-management
   intervention using motivational interviewing skills, aimed to increase
   engagement and commitment in severe COPD patients.
   METHODS: The intervention was developed and pilot tested for fidelity to
   protocol, for patient and interventionist feedback (qualitative) and
   effect on quality of life. Engagement between patient and
   interventionists was measured by the Working Alliance Inventory. The
   intervention was refined on the basis of the results of the pilot study
   and delivered in the active arm of a prospective randomized study.
   RESULTS: The pilot study suggested improvements in quality of life,
   fidelity to theory, and patient acceptability. The refined
   self-management intervention was delivered 540 times in the active arm
   of a randomized study. We observed a retention rate of 86% (patients
   missing or not available for only 14% the scheduled encounters).
   CONCLUSIONS: A self-management intervention that includes motivational
   interviewing as the way if guiding patients into behavior change is
   feasible in severe COPD and may increase patient engagement and
   commitment to self-management. This provides a very detailed description
   of the process for the specifics of training and delivering the
   intervention, which facilitates replicability in other settings and
   could be translated to cardiac rehabilitation.

AB Many previous works suggested that visual indicators could be used to
   predict landscape preferences. Most works, however, judged the visual
   indicators by a subjective method, which was criticized for lack of
   standardization in methodology, nontransparent application of values,
   and lack of replicability. This paper studied the relationships between
   landscape preferences and 10 visual indicators, among which seven
   indicators were evaluated by an objective measurement. Another three
   indicators (years of history heritages, number of landscape elements,
   and impression) were evaluated by a subjective method because they
   depend on a human's perception. The landscape preferences were judged by
   undergraduate students based on the stimuli of 30 photographs taken in
   the two cities of Hangzhou and Suzhou in the east of China. The results
   show that students prefer landscape with historical heritage of 200-600
   years, moderate impression, approximately 60% of open land cover and 45%
   of water body cover, lower plant cover, more heterogeneities, and higher
   naturalness; no significantly statistical relationships exist between
   students' preference scores and the ratio of disturbed area, building
   cover, or topographic variation cover. These results were confirmed by
   another six photographs; and last, some suggestions for landscape design
   were given. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)UP.1943-5444.0000137. (C) 2013 American

AB The Vehicle in the Loop (VIL) is a simulator, which combines real
   driving experience with the replicability and safety of simulators. In
   the VIL test setup a real test vehicle is combined with a virtual
   testing environment which is displayed to the user via a head-mounted
   display (HMD). In theory, this simulation concept renders the VIL
   uniquely suited to the development and evaluation of numerous automotive
   applications, including driver assistance systems. Aiming to assess the
   extent to which the VIL elicits realistic driving responses, a
   validation study was performed. In this first validation study the focus
   was on longitudinal driving behavior. 44 participants performed five
   common traffic maneuvers in reality and the VIL setup. Simulator
   sickness was assessed with the simulator sickness questionnaire (SSQ).
   Descriptive and inferential analyses of the data showed that the VIL
   achieves relative validity concerning brake pressure and reaction times
   and absolute validity concerning the steering angle. However, subjects
   showed longer reaction times and accelerated more smoothly while driving
   the VIL. One possible explanation for these results could be the
   presence of simulator sickness. Overall, the study indicates that the
   VIL represents a suitable testing method for the evaluation and
   development of driver assistance systems. The study also provided clear
   indications for the future development of the VIL.

AB BACKGROUND: Future physicians may not be prepared for the challenges of
   caring for the growing population of poor patients in this country.
   Given the potential for a socioeconomic "gulf" between physicians and
   patients and the lack of curricula that address the specific needs of
   poor patients, resident knowledge about caring for this underserved
   population is low.
   INTERVENTION: We created a 2-day Resident Academy orientation, before
   the start of residency training, to improve community knowledge and
   address resident attitudes toward poor patients through team-based
   experiential activities. We collected demographic and satisfaction data
   through anonymous presurvey and postsurvey t tests, and descriptive
   analysis of the quantitative data were conducted. Qualitative comments
   from open-ended questions were reviewed, coded, and divided into themes.
   We also offer information on the cost and replicability of the Academy.
   RESULTS: Residents rated most components of the Academy as "very good"
   or "excellent." Satisfaction scores were higher among residents in
   primary care training programs than among residents in nonprimary care
   programs for most Academy elements. Qualitative data demonstrated an
   overall positive effect on resident knowledge and attitudes about
   community resource availability for underserved patients, and the
   challenges of poor patients to access high-quality health care.
   CONCLUSIONS: The Resident Academy orientation improved knowledge and
   attitudes of new residents before the start of residency, and residents
   were satisfied with the experience. The commitment of institutional
   leaders is essential for success.

AB The paper reports on a prototype urban metabolism approach to model
   carbon cycling through an urban neighborhood. The approach uses
   bottom-up modeling of urban form components (buildings, vehicles,
   people, plants) to assess the neighborhood-wide storage, intake and
   export (including atmospheric emissions) of carbon. Model inputs (land
   cover, population, building types, vegetation structure) were derived
   through integration of spatial and non-spatial data from remote sensing,
   statistical and cadastral sources. Results are quantified and
   illustrated as whole system and component carbon flows attributable to
   (i) buildings, (ii) transportation, (iii) humans (including food and
   waste), and (iv) vegetation and soils sectors. Three emissions reduction
   scenarios use these results as a baseline against which to illustrate
   the potential of familiar climate change planning strategies. These
   scenarios achieve per capita emission reductions targets of
   approximately 37%, 52% and 69% from that baseline. Concluding discussion
   considers the limits, replicability and potential of the approach for
   linking climate change to local planning. Crown Copyright (C) 2012

AB Mechanisms of visual perception should be robustly fast and provide
   veridical information about environmental objects in order to facilitate
   survival and successful coping. Because species-specific brain
   mechanisms for fast vision must have evolved under heavy pressure for
   efficiency, it has been held that different human individuals see the
   physical world in the same way and produce psychophysical functions of
   visual discrimination that are qualitatively the same. For many years,
   this assumption has been implicitly accepted in vision research studying
   extremely fast, basic visual processes, including studies of visual
   masking. However, in recent studies of metacontrast masking surprisingly
   robust individual differences in the qualitative aspects of subjects'
   performance have been found. As the basic species-specific visual
   functions very likely are based on universal brain mechanisms of vision,
   these differences probably are the outcome of variability in ontogenetic
   development (i.e., formation of idiosyncrasic skills of perception).
   Such developmental differences can be brought about by variants of genes
   that are differentially expressed in the course of CNS development. The
   objective of this study was to assess whether visual discrimination in
   metacontrast masking is related to three widely studied genetic
   polymorphisms implicated in brain function and used here as independent
   variables. The findings suggest no main effects of BDNF Val66Met,
   NRG1/rs6994992, or 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms on metacontrast performance,
   but several notable interactions of genetic variables with gender, stage
   of the sequence of experimental trials, perceptual strategies, and
   target/mask shape congruence were found. Thus, basic behavioral
   functions of fast vision may be influenced by common genetic
   variability. Also, when left uncontrolled, genetic factors may seriously
   confound variables in vision research using masking, obscure clear
   theoretical interpretation, lead to unexplicable inter-regional
   differences and create problems of replicability of formerly successful
   experiments.

   shows that the regional festivals clusters have a certain scale, with an
   clear economic and social effects; regional sports tourism is developing
   separately, with a broad prospect, but the development is slow or
   stagnant; the basis of the coupling consist of the homology of the
   cultural form, the identity of the region, the consistency of the target
   and the replicability of the experiences. With the aid of the brand
   effects of the festivals clusters, regional sports tourism will get a
   wide range of social awareness in a short time, in turn, the festivals
   clusters will get some new development power. At present, we should
   strengthen the linkage of the festivals clusters, absorb the sports
   tourism elements for the contents and forms of the festivals clusters,
   and widen the marine development direction for the festivals clusters;
   develop the sports tourism products suitable for the festivals clusters,
   promote the integrated development of culture, sports and tourism,

AB India's wildlife conservation strategy relies on creating 'inviolate'
   protected areas (PAs) free from human disturbance, using policing of PAs
   and physical displacement of human populations as the preferred tools to
   do so. Conservation-induced displacement causes not just loss of
   livelihood and dwellings but also increases vulnerability and
   impoverishment risks of displaced people. By and large, the state's
   record of rehabilitating people displaced from PAs has been quite dismal
   in India. This article examines a rare case of conservation-induced
   displacement and resettlement where the livelihood outcomes for the
   displaced people are said to be positive. The relocation of over 400
   households from the Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary in Karnataka in the late
   1990s has been held up as a case where both conservation goals and local
   people's livelihoods gained from displacement. The success of Bhadra has
   inspired a spate of calls by conservationists in India to use village
   relocation as a 'win-win' opportunity to attain simultaneously the goals
   of wildlife conservation and poverty alleviation for forest-dwelling
   communities. This article delves into the process and politics of
   displacement, resettlement and rehabilitation in Bhadra from the point
   of view of examining this claim and assessing its replicability
   elsewhere.

AB BACKGROUND: Honey is a viscous, supersaturated sugar solution derived
   from nectar gathered and modified by the honeybee, Apis mellifera. Honey
   has been used since ancient times as a remedy in wound care. Evidence
   from animal studies and some trials has suggested that honey may
   accelerate wound healing.
   OBJECTIVES: The objective was to determine whether honey increases the
   rate of healing in acute wounds (e.g. burns, lacerations) and chronic
   wounds (e.g. skin ulcers, infected surgical wounds).
   SEARCH METHODS: For this first update of the review we searched the
   Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 13 June 2012); The
   Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane
   Library 2012, Issue 5); Ovid MEDLINE (2008 to May Week 5 2012); Ovid
   MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations 12 June 2012); Ovid
   EMBASE (2008 to 2012 Week 23); and EBSCO CINAHL (2008 to 8 June 2012).
   SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised trials that
   evaluated honey as a treatment for any sort of acute or chronic wound
   were sought. There was no restriction in terms of source, date of
   publication or language. Wound healing was the primary endpoint.
   DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data from eligible trials were extracted
   and summarised by one review author, using a data extraction sheet, and
   independently verified by a second review author.
   MAIN RESULTS: We identified 25 trials (with a total of 2987
   participants) that met the inclusion criteria, including six new trials
   that were added to this update. In acute wounds, three trials evaluated
   the effect of honey in acute lacerations, abrasions or minor surgical
   wounds and 12 trials evaluated the effect of honey in burns. In chronic
   wounds, two trials evaluated the effect of honey in venous leg ulcers,
   and single trials investigated its effect in infected post-operative
   wounds, pressure injuries, cutaneous Lieshmaniasis, diabetic foot ulcers
   and Fournier's gangrene. Three trials recruited people into mixed groups
   of chronic or acute wounds. Most trials were at high or unclear risk of
   bias. In acute wounds, specifically partial-thickness burns, honey might
   reduce time to healing compared with some conventional dressings (WMD
   -4.68 days, 95%CI -4.28 to -5.09 days), but, when compared with early
   excision and grafting, honey delays healing in partial- and
   full-thickness burns (WMD 13.6 days, 95% CI 10.02 to 17.18 days). In
   chronic wounds, honey does not significantly increase healing in venous
   leg ulcers when used as an adjuvant to compression (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.96
   to 1.38), and may delay healing in cutaneous Leishmaniasis when used as
   an adjuvant to meglumine antimoniate compared to meglumine antimoniate
   alone (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.01).
   AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Honey dressings do not increase rates of healing
   significantly in venous leg ulcers when used as an adjuvant to
   compression. Honey may delay healing in partial- and full-thickness
   burns in comparison to early excision and grafting, and in cutaneous
   Leishmaniasis when used as an adjuvant with meglumine antimoniate. Honey
   might be superior to some conventional dressing materials, but there is
   considerable uncertainty about the replicability and applicability of
   this evidence. There is insufficient evidence to guide clinical practice
   in other types of wounds, and purchasers should refrain from providing
   honey dressings for routine use until sufficient evidence of effect is
   available.

   Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire (ZKPQ) at the factor-level.
   The ZKPQ assesses the five basic factors of Zuckerman's alternative
   five-factor model (AFFM). Study 1 (n = 449) assessed the psychometric
   properties of the Romanian version of the ZKPQ and verified its
   factorial structure. The factors reliability ranged from .69 to .88, and
   gender differences were similar to those found in the Spanish, French,
   and Chinese samples. Exploratory factor analysis supported the
   replicability of the original five-factor structure, and correlations
   between the scales showed that the five basic factors of the AFFM are
   relatively independent. Study 2 (n = 238) verified the convergent and
   divergent validity of the Romanian version of the ZKPQ, by testing its
   links with DECAS, a personality inventory based on the five-factor
   model, developed and well-validated on the Romanian population. The
   results showed good convergent and divergent validity, with all
   identified correlations supporting the correspondence between the two
   personality models. Overall, the present findings showed that the
   Romanian version of the ZKPQ is a valid tool for assessing personality
   traits according to the AFFM.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a method for
   ultrasonically molding polymer powder in a micro plastic part mold. In
   the method, a printed circuit board (PCB) in which micro-hole arrays are
   drilled is used as a micro cavity insert. With the utilization of
   ultrasonic vibration, the polymer powder, which is prefilled and
   compacted in a micro cavity, mutually generates great sliding friction
   heat so as to be rapidly plasticized and molded.
   Design/methodology/approach - Micro carbide drill bits of which the
   diameters are 100.0 mu m, 150.0 mu m and 200.0 mu m, respectively, are
   used for drilling the PCB to form a micro-hole array insert. Next, two
   kinds of various ultra-high molecule weight polyethylene (UHMW-PE)
   powder with various grain diameters are directly filled into a charging
   barrel and a mold cavity with the micro-hole array insert. Proper
   process parameters are set on ultrasonic plasticizing and molding
   equipment so that a molding test can be performed. The melt of UHMW-PE
   can be rapidly filled into the cavity. Finally, micro-column array
   plastic parts are successfully prepared.
   Findings - The micro-hole array PCB is a mold insert which is quite
   applicable for the ultrasonic molding of the powder in the mold. When a
   molding material is the coarse UHMW-PE powder with the grain diameter of
   about 350 mu m, the diameter replication rates of the micro-column array
   plastic parts become good in order with the increased micro-hole
   diameter of the PCB. When the fine UHMW-PE powder with the grain
   diameter of about 80 tan is adopted, the diameter replication rates of
   the micro-column array plastic parts become good in order with the
   decreased micro-hole diameter of the PCB.
   Originality/value - In this paper, the micro-column array plastic parts
   with good replicability are successfully prepared by a technique for
   ultrasonically plasticizing and molding in the cavity. The technique can
   be applied to the fields of medical treatment communication, optics,
   chemistry and so on, such as biological micro needle arrays, micro
   biological chips, optical memories, and micro chemical reaction chips.

PD 2013
PY 2013
AB Background
   Honey is a viscous, supersaturated sugar solution derived from nectar
   gathered and modified by the honeybee, Apis mellifera. Honey has been
   used since ancient times as a remedy in wound care. Evidence from animal
   studies and some trials has suggested that honey may accelerate wound
   healing.
   Objectives
   The objective was to determine whether honey increases the rate of
   healing in acute wounds (e. g. burns, lacerations) and chronic wounds
   (e. g. skin ulcers, infected surgical wounds).
   Search methods
   For this first update of the review we searched the Cochrane Wounds
   Group Specialised Register (searched 13 June 2012); The Cochrane Central
   Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012,
   Issue 5); Ovid MEDLINE (2008 to May Week 5 2012); Ovid MEDLINE
   (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations 12 June 2012); Ovid EMBASE
   (2008 to 2012 Week 23); and EBSCO CINAHL (2008 to 8 June 2012).
   Selection criteria
   Randomised and quasi-randomised trials that evaluated honey as a
   treatment for any sort of acute or chronic wound were sought. There was
   no restriction in terms of source, date of publication or language.
   Wound healing was the primary endpoint.
   Data collection and analysis
   Data from eligible trials were extracted and summarised by one review
   author, using a data extraction sheet, and independently verified by a
   second review author.
   Main results
   We identified 25 trials (with a total of 2987 participants) that met the
   inclusion criteria, including six new trials that were added to this
   update. In acute wounds, three trials evaluated the effect of honey in
   acute lacerations, abrasions or minor surgical wounds and 12 trials
   evaluated the effect of honey in burns. In chronic wounds, two trials
   evaluated the effect of honey in venous leg ulcers, and single trials
   investigated its effect in infected post-operative wounds, pressure
   injuries, cutaneous Lieshmaniasis, diabetic foot ulcers and Fournier's
   gangrene. Three trials recruited people into mixed groups of chronic or
   acute wounds. Most trials were at high or unclear risk of bias.
   In acute wounds, specifically partial-thickness burns, honey might
   reduce time to healing compared with some conventional dressings (WMD
   -4.68 days, 95% CI -4.28 to -5.09 days), but, when compared with early
   excision and grafting, honey delays healing in partial- and
   full-thickness burns (WMD 13.6 days, 95% CI 10.02 to 17.18 days). In
   chronic wounds, honey does not significantly increase healing in venous
   leg ulcers when used as an adjuvant to compression (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.96
   to 1.38), and may delay healing in cutaneous Leishmaniasis when used as
   an adjuvant to meglumine antimoniate compared to meglumine antimoniate
   alone (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.01).
   Authors' conclusions
   Honey dressings do not increase rates of healing significantly in venous
   leg ulcers when used as an adjuvant to compression. Honey may delay
   healing in partial-and full-thickness burns in comparison to early
   excision and grafting, and in cutaneous Leishmaniasis when used as an
   adjuvant with meglumine antimoniate. Honey might be superior to some
   conventional dressing materials, but there is considerable uncertainty
   about the replicability and applicability of this evidence. There is
   insufficient evidence to guide clinical practice in other types of
   wounds, and purchasers should refrain from providing honey dressings for
   routine use until sufficient evidence of effect is available.

AB This study analyses the fundamental components shaping the violence
   legitimation discourse of ETA (Euskadi Ta Askasuna). With this aim, a
   category system has been built, which organizes the psychosocial
   processes identified in previous studies related to violence
   legitimation. Based on the proposed category system, a content analysis
   was conducted on 21 statements of ETA, released between 1998 and 2011.
   An intra-observer and inter-observer reliability analysis reveals high
   level stability and replicability of the categorization. The results
   show, firstly, that outgroup components have a predominant presence over
   ingroup components. Secondly, in the components hierarchy, we observe
   that elements referring to identity come in first place, followed in
   similar frequencies by those related to violence representation and the
   definition of the situation.

   participants throughout the same critical traffic scenario experienced
   in a real driving environment and in the VIL simulation. Steering
   behavior was found to be less intense in the virtual driving
   environment. It was, however, affected equally in both driving
   environments by driver-independent steering wheel torque, demonstrating
   relative validity of the VIL setup with regard to steering responses in
   challenging situations.

AB Psychology has been historically plagued by the under-reporting of both
   replications and null findings. The avoidance of these core ingredients
   of scientific practice means that the psychology literature is
   unquestionably distorted. The bias in psychology is pervasive and
   systemic, afflicting researchers, reviewers, editors and journals, all
   of whom are wed to pursuing the novel and the curious at the expense of
   the reliable. Psychology therefore operates in a manner that is askew of
   other sciences, with the links between replicability and believability
   seemingly much weaker. Additional problems follow from the distorted way
   that psychology currently operates - including spinning findings,
   publication bias, and sadly, outright fraud. Such problems represent a
   serious challenge for psychologists to get their house-in-order - and
   one step is to make sure that replications and null findings find a home
   in psychology rather than remain our dirty little secrets that further
   eat away at the credibility of our science.

AB Background: Widespread changes in the health care landscape require a
   paradigm shift from an educational model where quality improvement (QI)
   expertise is centralized to a model where foundational and functional QI
   knowledge is widespread through all levels of a health care
   organization. Methods: To support a new educational structure
   prioritizing QI education as a stand-alone priority, a 6-month
   educational course was introduced for operational leaders (requiring
   completion of a real-life improvement project) and a second,
   introductory QI education set of 5 stand-alone classes was introduced
   for managers and frontline staff; the latter is provided at centralized
   sites, on-site, and via webinars. Additional QI courses have been
   introduced for board members. Results: Sixty operational leaders
   attended the first 2 offerings of the 6-month course and completed 50
   associated QI projects, as of July 2012; nearly 1500 participants have
   attended the "Just-in-Time" classes, representing 13 University of
   Pittsburgh Medical Center hospitals and affiliated facilities.
   Eighty-three percent of recent participants rated the 6-month course a 4
   or 5 in terms of efficacy. Two-thirds of participants from both 6-month
   series reported that they continued to work on their project once the
   class was over. Discussion: The number of course attendees and their
   feedback regarding efficacy of this educational approach, as well as the
   volume of associated completed projects, indicate success in providing
   greater numbers of staff at all levels of the organization with QI
   education and tools. This educational format shows promise for further
   refinement and replicability.

AB The use of manual-based interventions tends to improve client outcomes
   and promote replicability. With an increasingly strong link between
   funding and the use of empirically supported prevention and intervention
   programs, manual development and adaptation have become research
   priorities. As a result, researchers and scholars have generated
   guidelines for developing manuals from scratch, but there are no extant
   guidelines for adapting empirically supported, manualized prevention and
   intervention programs for use with new populations. Thus, this article
   proposes step-by-step guidelines for the manual adaptation process. It
   also describes two adaptations of an extensively researched anger
   management intervention to exemplify how an empirically supported
   program was systematically and efficiently adapted to achieve similar
   outcomes with vastly different populations in unique settings.

AB The micro-molding of thermoplastic polymer is a popular fabrication
   method for micro/nano devices because several thousand parts can be
   produced after a mold insert has been made. Most micro-molding
   techniques such as hot embossing or injection molding use thermal energy
   to plasticize the thermoplastic polymer, and require an additional
   cooling stage. Recently ultrasonic vibration energy has been used to
   soften a local region of thermoplastic polymer by inducing frictional
   heat between an ultrasonic tool horn and the polymer material. The
   present study aims to develop an ultrasonic patterning process in which
   the micro-patterns engraved on the tool horn are replicated onto the
   surface of a polymer film. For this purpose, the design of a tool horn
   for the ultrasonic patterning was investigated to obtain good
   replication characteristics of micro-patterns with uniformity thorough
   the entire pattern area. Finite element analyses were conducted to
   predict the vibration characteristics of the tool horn. Statistical
   analysis using the response surface method was concurrently performed to
   find the optimal design conditions to ensure high and uniform pattern
   replicability. Experimental verifications were then followed by
   application of the proposed horn design.

AB The use of confidence intervals (CIs) as an addition or as an

   promoted as a means to make researchers more aware of the uncertainty
   that is inherent in statistical inference. Little is known, however,
   about whether presenting results via CIs affects how readers judge the
   probability that an effect is present in the population of interest and
   whether a replication would be likely to reveal the same results. In the
   present study, 66 PhD students were asked to interpret statistical
   outcomes presented as CIs or as conventional statistics (t statistics
   and associated p values). Fewer misinterpretations of statistics-such as
   accepting the null hypothesis-and more references to effect size were
   found when results were presented as CIs. Furthermore, participants
   tended to be more certain about the existence of a population effect in
   the expected direction and about the replicability of the results when
   the results were presented following the conventions of NHST than when
   presented using CIs. Contrary to expectations, no evidence of a more
   precipitous drop in the belief of the existence of a population effect
   and replicability estimates when p values exceeded the significance
   level of .05 was found when data were presented using NHST instead of by
   CIs.

   their claims. We evaluate their results in terms of replicability and
   robustness. Overall, their analysis generally meets the standard of
   statistical replicability, though not perfectly. On the other hand, we
   do not find that their results are robust to changes in their baseline
   statistical specification. When model-averaging methods are employed to
   integrate information across alternative statistical specifications,
   little evidence survives that religious variables help to predict

AB We discuss three arguments voiced by scientists who view the current
   outpouring of concern about replicability as overblown. The first idea
   is that the adoption of a low alpha level (e.g., 5%) puts reasonable
   bounds on the rate at which errors can enter the published literature,
   making false-positive effects rare enough to be considered a minor
   issue. This, we point out, rests on statistical misunderstanding: The
   alpha level imposes no limit on the rate at which errors may arise in
   the literature (Ioannidis, 2005b). Second, some argue that whereas
   direct replication attempts are uncommon, conceptual replication
   attempts are common-providing an even better test of the validity of a
   phenomenon. We contend that performing conceptual rather than direct
   replication attempts interacts insidiously with publication bias,
   opening the door to literatures that appear to confirm the reality of
   phenomena that in fact do not exist. Finally, we discuss the argument
   that errors will eventually be pruned out of the literature if the field
   would just show a bit of patience. We contend that there are no
   plausible concrete scenarios to back up such forecasts and that what is
   needed is not patience, but rather systematic reforms in scientific
   practice.

   The tendency of psychological science to avoid publishing null results
   produces a situation that limits the replicability assumption of
   science, as replication cannot be meaningful without the potential
   acknowledgment of failed replications. We argue that the field often
   constructs arguments to block the publication and interpretation of null
   results and that null results may be further extinguished through
   questionable researcher practices. Given that science is dependent on
   the process of falsification, we argue that these problems reduce
   psychological science's capability to have a proper mechanism for theory
   falsification, thus resulting in the promulgation of numerous "undead"
   theories that are ideologically popular but have little basis in fact.

AB This article revisits two classical issues in experimental methodology:
   experimenter bias and demand characteristics. We report a content
   analysis of the method section of experiments reported in two psychology
   journals (Psychological Science and the Journal of Personality and
   Social Psychology), focusing on aspects of the procedure associated with
   these two phenomena, such as mention of the presence of the
   experimenter, suspicion probing, and handling of deception. We note that
   such information is very often absent, which prevents observers from
   gauging the extent to which such factors influence the results. We
   consider the reasons that may explain this omission, including the
   automatization of psychology experiments, the evolution of research
   topics, and, most important, a view of research participants as passive
   receptacles of stimuli. Using a situated social cognition perspective,
   we emphasize the importance of integrating the social context of
   experiments in the explanation of psychological phenomena. We illustrate
   this argument via a controversy on stereotype-based behavioral priming
   effects.

AB This article suggests that undergraduate research can help advance the
   science of psychology. We introduce a hypothetical "question-list
   paradigm" as a mechanism to do this. Each year, thousands of
   undergraduate projects are completed as part of the educational
   experience. Although many of these studies may not contain sufficient
   contributions for publication, they provide a good test of the
   replicability of established findings across populations at different
   institutions and geographic locations. Thus, these projects could meet
   the needs of recent calls for increased replications of psychological
   studies while simultaneously benefiting the student researchers, their
   instructors, and the field in general.

AB Several influential publications have sensitized the community of
   behavioral scientists to the dangers of inflated effects and
   false-positive errors leading to the unwarranted publication of
   nonreplicable findings. This issue has been related to prominent cases
   of data fabrication and survey results pointing to bad practices in
   empirical science. Although we concur with the motives behind these
   critical arguments, we note that an isolated debate of false positives
   may itself be misleading and counter-productive. Instead, we argue that,
   given the current state of affairs in behavioral science, false
   negatives often constitute a more serious problem. Referring to Wason's
   (1960) seminal work on inductive reasoning, we show that the failure to
   assertively generate and test alternative hypotheses can lead to
   dramatic theoretical mistakes, which cannot be corrected by any kind of
   rigor applied to statistical tests of the focal hypotheses. We conclude
   that a scientific culture rewarding strong inference (Platt, 1964) is
   more likely to see progress than a culture preoccupied with tightening
   its standards for the mere publication of original findings.

AB Objective: Our aim was to assess the effectiveness and reliability of
   spatiotemporal signal space separation (tSSS) and movement correction
   (MC) in magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings disturbed by head
   movements and magnetized material on the head.
   Methods: We recorded MEG from 20 healthy adults in stationary
   (reference) head position and during controlled head movements. Nearby
   magnetic interference sources were simulated by attaching magnetized
   particles on the subject's head. Auditory and somatosensory stimuli were
   presented. MC, tSSS and averaging were performed to obtain auditory
   (AEF) and somatosensory (SEF) evoked fields. Neuronal sources were
   modeled as equivalent current dipoles. MC was also validated by
   reconstructing signals generated by current dipoles in a phantom.
   Results: After MC, the AEF and SEF responses recorded during
   intermittent head movements were similar in amplitude to the reference
   recordings and differed by 5-7 mm in source location. The tSSS method
   removed artifacts due to the attached magnetized particles but did not
   affect the reference data.
   Conclusions: The methods are able to reliably recover MEG responses
   contaminated by movements and magnetic artifacts on the head.
   Significance: The combination of tSSS and MC methods is especially
   useful in clinical measurements, where movements and magnetic
   disturbances are commonly present. (C) 2012 International Federation of

AB Herpes keratitis is one of the most severe pathologies associated with
   the herpes simplex virus-type 1 ( HSV-1). Herpes keratitis is currently
   the leading cause of both cornea-derived and infection-associated
   blindness in the developed world. Typical presentation of herpes
   keratitis includes infection of the corneal epithelium and sometimes the
   deeper corneal stroma and endothelium, leading to such permanent corneal
   pathologies as scarring, thinning, and opacity (1).
   Corneal HSV-1 infection is traditionally studied in two types of
   experimental models. The in vitro model, in which cultured monolayers of
   corneal epithelial cells are infected in a Petri dish, offers
   simplicity, high level of replicability, fast experiments, and
   relatively low costs. On the other hand, the in vivo model, in which
   animals such as rabbits or mice are inoculated directly in the cornea,
   offers a highly sophisticated physiological system, but has higher
   costs, longer experiments, necessary animal care, and a greater degree
   of variability.
   In this video article, we provide a detailed demonstration of a new ex
   vivo model of corneal epithelial HSV-1 infection, which combines the
   strengths of both the in vitro and the in vivo models. The ex vivo model
   utilizes intact corneas organotypically maintained in culture and
   infected with HSV-1. The use of the ex vivo model allows for highly
   physiologically-based conclusions, yet it is rather inexpensive and
   requires time commitment comparable to that of the in vitro model.

AB K-means is one of the most widely used clustering algorithms in various
   disciplines, especially for large datasets. However the method is known
   to be highly sensitive to initial seed selection of cluster centers.
   K-means++ has been proposed to overcome this problem and has been shown
   to have better accuracy and computational efficiency than k-means. In
   many clustering problems though - such as when classifying georeferenced
   data for mapping applications - standardization of clustering
   methodology, specifically, the ability to arrive at the same cluster
   assignment for every run of the method i.e. replicability of the
   methodology, may be of greater significance than any perceived measure
   of accuracy, especially when the solution is known to be non-unique, as
   in the case of k-means clustering. Here we propose a simple initial seed
   selection algorithm for k-means clustering along one attribute that
   draws initial cluster boundaries along the "deepest valleys" or greatest
   gaps in dataset. Thus, it incorporates a measure to maximize distance
   between consecutive cluster centers which augments the conventional
   k-means optimization for minimum distance between cluster center and
   cluster members. Unlike existing initialization methods, no additional
   parameters or degrees of freedom are introduced to the clustering
   algorithm. This improves the replicability of cluster assignments by as
   much as 100% over k-means and k-means++, virtually reducing the variance
   over different runs to zero, without introducing any additional
   parameters to the clustering process. Further, the proposed method is
   more computationally efficient than k-means++ and in some cases, more
   accurate. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Flowshop scheduling is a very active research area. This problem still
   attracts a considerable amount of interest despite the sheer amount of
   available results. Total flowtime minimization of a flowshop has been
   actively studied and many effective algorithms have been proposed in the
   last few years. New best solutions have been found for common benchmarks
   at a rapid pace. However, these improvements many times come at the cost
   of sophisticated algorithms. Complex methods hinder potential
   applications and are difficult to extend to small problem variations.
   Replicability of results is also a challenge. In this paper, we examine
   simple and easy to implement methods that at the same time result in
   state-of-the-art performance. The first two proposed methods are based
   on the well known Iterated Local Search (ILS) and Iterated Greedy (IG)
   frameworks, which have been applied with great success to other flowshop
   problems. Additionally, we present extensions of these methods that work
   over populations, something that we refer to as population-based ILS
   (pILS) and population-based IG (pIGA), respectively. We calibrate the
   presented algorithms by means of the Design of Experiments (DOE)
   approach. Extensive comparative evaluations are carried out against the
   most recent techniques for the considered problem in the literature. The
   results of a comprehensive computational and statistical analysis show
   that the presented algorithms are very effective. Furthermore, we show
   that, despite their simplicity, the presented methods are able to
   improve 12 out of 120 best known solutions of Taillard's flowshop
   benchmark with total flowtime criterion. [All rights reserved Elsevier].

AB Sleep deprivation is a condition that is more and more observed in
   modern society bringing various neurobehavioral effects, being anxious
   states one of the main problems. Many studies have successfully
   demonstrated the relationship between sleep deprivation and anxiety in
   clinical research. As to basic experimentation, various models have been
   efficiently used in order to evaluate an anxious behavior. However, the
   same efficacy is not found on basic studies that deal with the
   relationship between paradoxical sleep and anxiety. The great majority
   of studies which approach this matter in animal models do not present
   results that may be applied to clinical practice and this is basically
   due to two reasons: inconsistency among results and lack of
   replicability as related to clinical studies. It has to be emphasized
   that the use of animal models is extremely useful, mainly under
   experimental conditions which cannot be ethically or plausibly be
   approached in human beings. So, the present theoretical assay tries to
   evaluate in a brief and critical manner the applicability of animal
   models in sleep deprivation under a translational perspective.

AB Stephen Jay Gould argued that replaying the "tape of life" would result
   in a radically different evolutionary outcome. Some biologists and
   philosophers, however, have pointed to convergent evolution as evidence
   for robust replicability in macroevolution. These authors interpret
   homoplasy, or the independent origination of similar biological forms,
   as evidence for the power of natural selection to guide form toward
   certain morphological attractors, notwithstanding the diversionary
   tendencies of drift and the constraints of phylogenetic inertia. In this
   paper, I consider the implications of homoplasy for the debate over the
   nature of macroevolution. I argue that once the concepts of contingency
   and convergence are fleshed out, it becomes clear that many instances of
   homoplasy fail to negate Gould's overarching thesis, and may in fact
   support a Gouldian view of life. My argument rests on the distinction
   between parallelism and convergence, which I defend against a recent
   challenge from developmental biology. I conclude that despite the
   difficulties in defining and identifying parallelism, the concept
   remains useful and relevant to the contingency controversy insofar as it
   underscores the common developmental origins of iterated evolution.

AB Hazardous alcohol use is a well-established risk factor for men's

   the association. The current study extends understanding of the
   hazardous alcohol use-IPV link by examining what factors moderate this
   association in a more systematic and broader way that has been done in
   past studies. Individual, family, workplace, community, and
   developmental factors were tested as moderators of the hazardous alcohol
   use and IPV link in a large, representative sample of active duty
   service members (the 2006 Community Assessment), and the results were
   tested for replicability in a hold-out sample. Two family variables
   (relationship satisfaction and parent-child satisfaction), 1 community
   variable (community safety), and 3 developmental variables (years in the
   military, marital length, and family income/pay grade) cross-validated
   as significant moderators of the association between men's hazardous
   alcohol use and IPV. Across the significant moderators, the association
   between hazardous alcohol use and men's IPV was weakened by
   maturation/development, improved community safety, and better
   relationship functioning. No individual or workplace variables were
   significant moderators for men, and there were no significant moderators
   found for women. The results support the importance of a developmental
   and relational perspective to understanding the hazardous alcohol
   use-IPV link, rather than solely an individual coping perspective.

   still needed on a group ripe for early IPV intervention: high
   school-aged adolescents. This article revisits our previous analyses of
   young female reproductive clinic patients (Messinger, Davidson, &
   Rickert, 2011) by examining how the adolescent and young adult
   respondents differ. To explore replicability of the adolescent results
   across populations, they are compared to 487 adolescent female students
   sampled from four urban high schools. Across samples, all communication
   strategies were used more frequently within violent relationships.
   Multivariate analysis identified escalating strategies used and received
   as being positively associated with physical violence used and received
   in all three samples. Regarding verbal reasoning and temporary conflict
   avoidance, substantial differences appeared between the young adult and
   adolescent clinic samples, and results from the adolescent clinic sample
   were largely replicated with the adolescent school sample, suggesting
   that young adult samples in this literature are not adequate proxies for
   adolescents.

AB Background: The goal of this study was to test a hypothesis associating
   impulsivity with an elevated body mass index (BMI). Methods: To this
   end, we examined associations of BMI with putative genetic,
   neurophysiological, psychiatric, and psychological indicators of
   impulsivity in 78 women and 74 men formerly dependent on alcohol or
   drugs. A second analysis was designed to test the replicability of the
   genetic findings in an independent sample of 109 women and 111 men with
   a similar history of substance dependence. Results: The results of the
   first analysis showed that BMI was positively correlated with Total and
   Nonplanning Scale Scores on the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale and the
   number of childhood symptoms of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder
   in women. It was also positively correlated, in women, with a GABRA2
   variant previously implicated as a risk factor for substance dependence
   and an objective electroencephalographic feature previously associated
   with GABRA2 and relapse risk. The second analysis confirmed that the
   correlation between BMI and the substance-dependence-associated GABRA2
   genotype was reliable and sex-specific. Conclusions: We conclude that an
   elevated BMI is associated with genetic, neurophysiological,
   psychiatric, and psychological indicators of impulsivity. The sex
   difference may be explained by greater opportunities to eat and overeat,
   a preference for higher calorie foods, a longer duration of alcohol/drug
   abstinence, or previous pregnancies in women. (Am J Addict

AB Background: The population with multiple chronic conditions is growing.
   Prior studies indicate that patients with comorbidities are frequently
   excluded from trials but do not address whether information is available
   in trials to draw conclusions about treatment effects for these
   patients.
   Methods and Findings: We conducted a literature survey of trials from 11
   Cochrane Reviews for four chronic diseases (diabetes, heart failure,
   chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and stroke). The Cochrane Reviews
   systematically identified and summarized trials on the effectiveness of
   diuretics, metformin, anticoagulants, longacting beta-agonists alone or
   in combination with inhaled corticosteroids, lipid lowering agents,
   exercise and diet. Eligible studies were reports of trials included in
   the Cochrane reviews and additional papers that described the methods of
   these trials. We assessed the exclusion and inclusion of people with
   comorbidities, the reporting of comorbidities, and whether comorbidities
   were considered as potential modifiers of treatment effects. Overall,
   the replicability of both the inclusion criteria (mean [standard
   deviation (SD)]: 6.0 (2.1), range (min-max): 1-9.5) and exclusion
   criteria(mean(SD): 5.3 (2.1), range: 1-9.5) was only moderate. Trials
   excluded patients with many common comorbidities. The proportion of
   exclusions for comorbidities ranged from 042 percent for heart failure,
   0-55 percent for COPD, 0-44 percent for diabetes, and 0-39 percent for
   stroke. Seventy of the 161 trials (43.5%) described the prevalence of
   any comorbidity among participants with the index disease. The reporting
   of comorbidities in trials was very limited, in terms of reporting an
   operational definition and method of ascertainment for the presence of
   comorbidity and treatments for the comorbidity. It was even less common
   that the trials assessed whether comorbidities were potential modifiers
   of treatment effects.
   Conclusions: Comorbidities receive little attention in chronic disease
   trials. Given the public health importance of people with multiple
   chronic conditions, trials should better report on comorbidities and
   assess the effect comorbidities have on treatment outcomes.

AB The financial viability of Social Security, the single largest U.S.
   government program, depends on accurate forecasts of the solvency of its
   intergenerational trust fund. We begin by detailing information
   necessary for replicating the Social Security Administration's (SSA's)
   forecasting procedures, which until now has been unavailable in the
   public domain. We then offer a way to improve the quality of these
   procedures via age- and sex-specific mortality forecasts. The most
   recent SSA mortality forecasts were based on the best available
   technology at the time, which was a combination of linear extrapolation
   and qualitative judgments. Unfortunately, linear extrapolation excludes
   known risk factors and is inconsistent with long-standing demographic
   patterns, such as the smoothness of age profiles. Modern statistical
   methods typically outperform even the best qualitative judgments in
   these contexts. We show how to use such methods, enabling researchers to
   forecast using far more information, such as the known risk factors of
   smoking and obesity and known demographic patterns. Including this extra
   information makes a substantial difference. For example, by improving
   only mortality forecasting methods, we predict three fewer years of net
   surplus, $730 billion less in Social Security Trust Funds, and program
   costs that are 0.66% greater for projected taxable payroll by 2031
   compared with SSA projections. More important than specific numerical
   estimates are the advantages of transparency, replicability, reduction
   of uncertainty, and what may be the resulting lower vulnerability to the
   politicization of program forecasts. In addition, by offering with this
   article software and detailed replication information, we hope to
   marshal the efforts of the research community to include ever more
   informative inputs and to continue to reduce uncertainties in Social
   Security forecasts.

AB Background: The first step in the analysis of a dermatoscopically imaged
   melanocytic lesion is segmentation informally, isolating those points in
   the image belonging to the lesion from those belonging to the
   surrounding non-lesional skin. Although typically studied in the context
   of automated analysis, segmentation is a necessary step even for human
   operators who plan to evaluate quantitative features of a lesion (such
   as diameter or asymmetry). Methods: In a double blind evaluation of the
   segmentation of 77 digital dermatoscopic images, we observed a
   significant inter-operator variability. Results: The area of the
   disagreement region was on average 15.28% of the area of the lesion
   itself, and in 10% of the cases it was more than 28%. More experienced
   dermatologists showed greater agreement among themselves than with less
   experienced dermatologists, and a slight tendency toward tighter
   segmentations. Conclusion: The evaluation methodology addresses a number
   of crucial difficulties encountered in previous studies and may be of
   independent interest. Our results underscore the necessity of taking
   into account inter-operator variability in large epidemiological
   studies, in particular those involving less experienced dermatologists,
   and of striving toward techniques allowing greater standardization and
   replicability in the evaluation of the fundamental visual parameters of
   lesions.

AB Introduction: Through The Global Plan Towards the Elimination of New HIV
   Infections Among Children by 2015 and Keeping their Mothers Alive,
   leaders have called for broader action to strengthen the involvement of
   communities. The Global Plan aspires to reduce new HIV infections among
   children by 90 percent, and to reduce AIDS-related maternal mortality by
   half. This article summarizes the results of a review commissioned by
   UNAIDS to help inform stakeholders on promising practices in community
   engagement to accelerate progress towards these ambitious goals.
   Methods: This research involved extensive literature review and key
   informant interviews. Community engagement was defined to include
   participation, mobilization and empowerment while excluding activities
   that involve communities solely as service recipients. A promising
   practice was defined as one for which there is documented evidence of
   its effectiveness in achieving intended results and some indication of
   replicability, scale up and/or sustainability.
   Results: Promising practices that increased the supply of preventing
   mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) services included extending
   community cadres, strengthening linkages with community- and faith-based
   organizations and civic participation in programme monitoring. Practices
   to improve demand for PMTCT included community-led social and behaviour
   change communication, peer support and participative approaches to
   generate local solutions. Practices to create an enabling environment
   included community activism and government leadership for greater
   involvement of communities.
   Committed leadership at all levels, facility, community, district and
   national, is crucial to success. Genuine community engagement requires a
   rights-based, capacity-building approach and sustained financial and
   technical investment. Participative formative research is a first step
   in building community capacity and helps to ensure programme relevance.
   Building on existing structures, rather than working in parallel to
   them, improves programme efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability.
   Monitoring, innovation and information sharing are critical to scale up.
   Conclusions: Ten recommendations on community engagement are offered for
   ending vertical transmission and enhancing the health of mothers and
   families: (1) expand the frontline health workforce, (2) increase
   engagement with community- and faith-based organizations, (3) engage
   communities in programme monitoring and accountability, (4) promote
   community- driven social and behaviour change communication including
   grassroots campaigns and dialogues, (5) expand peer support, (6) empower
   communities to address programme barriers, (7) support community
   activism for political commitment, (8) share tools for community
   engagement, (9) develop better indicators for community involvement and
   (10) conduct cost analyses of various community engagement strategies.
   As programmes expand, care should be taken to support and not to
   undermine work that communities are already doing, but rather to
   actively identify and build on such efforts.

AB A 1-hour temperature-based toxicity test using Daphnia magna was
   developed and then compared with a 24-hour standard acute toxicity test.
   The 1-hour toxicity test was based on the observation that daphnids in
   high temperatures become weak and more susceptible to toxicants than
   daphnids at room temperature. Theorizing that this relationship could be
   utilized to produce a short-term toxicity test, we analyzed the
   experimental data and identified 36.5 degrees C as the ideal temperature
   for a 1-hour temperature-based toxicity test. After the test was
   formulated, it was used to screen 15 toxicants. Eight heavy metals, 4
   pesticides, 2 anions, phenol, and 2 industrial wastewaters were
   screened, using the 1-hour toxicity test and the 24-hour standard acute
   toxicity test. For the 1-hour toxicity test, vials containing 5 daphnids
   (<24 h), medium, and toxicant, all at room temperature, were prepared
   and placed in a water bath set at 36.5 degrees C for 1 hour. After 1
   hour, the numbers of live (no toxic effect) daphnids and immobilized
   (toxic effect) daphnids were counted, and the median effective
   concentrations (EC50) were determined.
   A comparison of the EC50 values of the 1-hour temperature-based toxicity
   test and those of the 24-hour standard acute toxicity test produced a
   correlation of 0.9999. When individual toxicants were compared, the
   24-hour standard acute toxicity test was better at detecting lower test
   concentrations than the 1-hour temperature-based toxicity test. When
   both tests were used to screen industrial wastewater and their results
   were compared, the 1-hour toxicity test showed some promise. However,
   further testing will need to be done, because only 2 of the 10 samples
   collected initially contained significant amounts of toxicants for EC50
   calculation. Finally, while the 1-hour toxicity test was effective in
   screening 15 tested toxicants and has the potential to be useful in
   screening industrial wastewater, this conclusion is limited to those 15
   tested toxicants and 2 industrial wastewaters. Additional experiments
   will be needed for other toxicants. The 1-hour toxicity test presented
   in this study is the first temperature-based toxicity test developed for
   D. magna, and it will be an attractive short-term assay for its
   convenience, cost-efficiency, and replicability.

AB Depression affects 20-30% of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in the
   U.S. and predicts greater sexual risk behaviors, lower antiretroviral
   (ARV) medication adherence, and worse clinical outcomes. Yet little
   experimental evidence addresses the critical clinical question of
   whether depression treatment improves ARV adherence and clinical
   outcomes in PLWHA with depression. The Strategies to Link Antidepressant
   and Antiretroviral Management at Duke, UAB, and UNC (SLAM DUNC) Study is
   a randomized clinical effectiveness trial funded by the National
   Institute for Mental Health. The objective of SLAM DUNC is to test
   whether a depression treatment program integrated into routine HIV
   clinical care affects ARV adherence. PLWHA with depression (n = 390) are
   randomized to enhanced usual care or a depression treatment model called
   Measurement-Based Care (MBC). MBC deploys a clinically supervised
   Depression Care Manager (DCM) to provide evidence-based antidepressant
   treatment recommendations to a non-psychiatric prescribing provider,
   guided by systematic and ongoing measures of depressive symptoms and
   side effects. MBC has limited time requirements and the DCM role can be
   effectively filled by a range of personnel given appropriate training
   and supervision, enhancing replicability. In SLAM DUNC, MBC is
   integrated. into HIV care to support HIV providers in antidepressant
   prescription and management. The primary endpoint is ARV adherence
   measured by unannounced telephone-based pill counts at 6 months with
   follow-up to 12 months and secondary endpoints including viral load,
   health care utilization, and depressive severity. Important outcomes of
   this study will be evidence of the effectiveness of MBC in treating
   depression in PLWHA and improving HIV-related outcomes. (C) 2012

   embossing method, which enables the replication of microfeatures onto
   the surfaces of flexible polymer substrates. An IR-assisted roll-to-roll
   embossing facility was designed and built in our laboratory especially
   for this study. Metallic rollers bearing micropatterns of two different
   feature sizes, namely 150 and 20 mu m in depth, were employed. The
   former one was prepared by microelectric discharge machining the roller,
   whereas the latter was fabricated by electroplating a thin layer of
   nickel on the surface of the roller, followed by a diamond turning
   process to create the microstructures. The embossing facility was used
   to replicate the microstructure onto polyethylene terephthalate and
   polycarbonate films in the experiments. During roller embossing, the IR
   radiation shed on the rollers, and the energy was converted into heat to
   melt the polymer substrates and to replicate the microstructures. The
   influence of various processing parameters on the replicability of
   microfeatures was investigated. Under the proper processing conditions,
   double-sided flexible polymer substrates with microstructures could be
   successfully fabricated. The proposed method shows great potential for

   bodies. It is composed of a Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) created in
   2007, SDI-OTALEX (www.ideotalex.eu), which is an exchange platform for
   geographic information and Webmapping services among project partners.
   The integration of environmental indicators such as landscape
   indicators, for the characterization and monitoring of the Alentejo
   Extremadura area is one of the most relevant components of the project.
   This paper reports the achievements in defining Local Landscape Units
   (LLU) for a pilot area of Central Alentejo - the Pardiela river basin.
   The methodological approach applied Geographic Information System tools
   to integrate soils, geomorphology and land cover. The land cover map
   applies the CORINE Land Cover Legend Level 5 to Central Alentejo at a
   scale of 1 : 10,000. This map contains variables related to vegetation,
   hydrology (streams and water bodies) and human settlements (buildings,
   equipment, roads). The validation of the results obtained for LLU with
   previously defined Landscape Units and potential vegetation mapping
   confirm the reliability and replicability of the present methodology for
   similar territories.

AB Purpose: Prostate cancer patients often suffer from treatment-associated
   morbidities which lead to severe physical and mental impairments.
   Nevertheless, only a relatively small percentage of this patient
   population uses medical rehabilitation services; there is still a lack
   of evidence concerning possible factors causing use and non-use of
   services. Therefore, this study exploratively aims at the identification
   of predictors of the use of rehabilitation services in a cohort of
   prostate cancer patients.
   Method: In a prospective multicentre study to evaluate outpatient
   oncological rehabilitation services, n=242 prostate cancer patients who
   used outpatient or inpatient rehabilitation services ("users") were
   compared with n=253 prostate cancer patients who did not use
   rehabilitation ("non-users") at measure point 1. At the beginning of the
   rehabilitation programme and at the end of primary treatment,
   respectively, patients completed a self-report questionnaire consisting
   of standardized instruments designed to assess the following independent
   variables: autonomy striving (TPF), self-efficacy expectancy (GSE),
   distress (distress thermometer), anxiety and depression (HADS-D),
   quality of life (SF-8), social support (SSUK), rehabilitation
   motivation: readiness to change, knowledge, scepticism regarding
   rehabilitation services (PAREMO-20). Illness- and treatment-related
   variables (tumour state, comorbidity, primary therapies) were documented
   by the attending oncologists.
   Results: Only few significant and effective differences between
   rehabilitation users and non-users are observed: Non-users are suffering
   more often from gastrointestinal comorbidities (18% vs. 2%, w=0.25).
   Both patient groups report severe quality-of-life impairments,
   particularly with respect to their physical functioning. Non-users
   achieve significantly higher scores on the scale "scepticism"
   (PAREMO-20) than users (eta(2)=0.19). The scale "scepticism" is also
   identified as the dominant predictor of utilization of rehabilitation
   services (R-2=0.23). Suffering from comorbid diseases of the digestive
   system, self-efficacy expectation and employment status emerge as
   further significant predictors (R-2=0.12, and R-2=0.02 each). With
   increasing scepticism and in case of comorbidity the probability of
   rehabilitation utilization was decreasing.
   Conclusion: Besides illness-related variables prostate cancer patients'
   expectancies regarding the effectiveness of rehabilitation services to
   alleviate their medical conditions seem to be more relevant for
   rehabilitation utilization than sociodemographic variables or

   about rehabilitative treatment options in order to remove any doubts and
   to be able to optimize oncological care.

AB Objective: The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a widely used
   measure of subjective sleep disturbance in clinical populations,
   including individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
   Although the severity of sleep disturbance is generally represented by a
   global symptom score, recent factor analytic studies suggest that the
   PSQI is better characterized by a two- or three-factor model than a
   one-factor model. This study examined the replicability of two- and
   three-factor models of the PSQI, as well as the relationship between
   PSQI factors and health outcomes, in a female sample with PTSD.
   Methods: The PSQI was administered to 319 women with PTSD related to
   sexual or physical assault. Confirmatory factor analyses tested the
   relative fit of one-, two-, and three-factor solutions. Bivariate
   correlations were performed to examine the shared variance between PSQI
   sleep factors and measures of PTSD, depression, anger, and physical
   symptoms.
   Results: Confirmatory factor analyses supported a three-factor model
   with Sleep Efficiency, Perceived Sleep Quality, and Daily Disturbances
   as separate indices of sleep quality. The severity of symptoms
   represented by the PSQI factors was positively associated with the
   severity of PTSD, depression, and physical symptoms. However, these
   health outcomes correlated as much or more with the global PSQI score as
   with PSQI factor scores.
   Conclusions: These results support the multidimensional structure of the
   PSQI. Despite this, the global PSQI score has as much or more
   explanatory power as individual PSQI factors in predicting health
   outcomes. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Twenty years since the Rio Summit, the global community is still
   struggling to develop a world with universal access to sustainable
   energy services. The discussion on energy and its linkages with
   sustainable development is at the heart of the debate in achieving the
   Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). This paper discusses the role of
   innovations in terms of partnerships and business models to enhance
   energy access, especially for those living at the so-called bottom of
   pyramid. The role of innovative energy options and policy choices that
   enable overall operationalization of energy access in developing
   countries as well as new forms of partnerships and innovative mechanisms
   that are based on established success, replicability and potential for
   scaling up has been examined through two case-studies, namely the
   Lighting a Billion Lives project and India's National Rural
   Electrification Programme. This paper suggests the need for new forms of
   public and private sector partnerships, especially the pro-poor ones
   that are effective in enhancing energy access. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Mutations in the synaptic scaffolding protein gene SHANK3 are strongly
   implicated in autism and Phelan-McDermid 22q13 deletion syndrome. The
   precise location of the mutation within the Shank3 gene is key to its
   phenotypic outcomes. Here, we report the physiological and behavioral
   consequences of null and heterozygous mutations in the ankyrin repeat
   domain in Shank3 mice. Both homozygous and heterozygous mice showed
   reduced glutamatergic transmission and long-term potentiation in the
   hippocampus with more severe deficits detected in the homozygous mice.
   Three independent cohorts were evaluated for magnitude and replicability
   of behavioral endophenotypes relevant to autism and Phelan-McDermid
   syndrome. Mild social impairments were detected, primarily in juveniles
   during reciprocal interactions, while all genotypes displayed normal
   adult sociability on the three-chambered task. Impaired novel object
   recognition and rotarod performance were consistent across cohorts of
   null mutants. Repetitive self-grooming, reduced ultrasonic
   vocalizations, and deficits in reversal of water maze learning were
   detected only in some cohorts, emphasizing the importance of replication
   analyses. These results demonstrate the exquisite specificity of
   deletions in discrete domains within the Shank3 gene in determining
   severity of symptoms.

AB Background. Symptom dimensions have not yet been comprehensively tested
   as predictors of the substantial heterogeneity in outcomes of
   antidepressant treatment in major depressive disorder.
   Method. We tested nine symptom dimensions derived from a previously
   published factor analysis of depression rating scales as predictors of
   outcome in 811 adults with moderate to severe depression treated with
   flexibly dosed escitalopram or nortriptyline in Genome-based Therapeutic
   Drugs for Depression (GENDEP). The effects of symptom dimensions were
   tested in mixed-effect regression models that controlled for overall
   initial depression severity, age, sex and recruitment centre.
   Significant results were tested for replicability in 3637 adult
   out-patients with non-psychotic major depression treated with citalopram
   in level I of Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression
   (STAR*D).
   Results. The interest-activity symptom dimension (reflecting low
   interest, reduced activity, indecisiveness and lack of enjoyment) at
   baseline strongly predicted poor treatment outcome in GENDEP,
   irrespective of overall depression severity, antidepressant type and
   outcome measure used. The prediction of poor treatment outcome by the
   interest-activity dimension was robustly replicated in STAR*D,
   independent of a comprehensive list of baseline covariates.
   Conclusions. Loss of interest, diminished activity and inability to make
   decisions predict poor outcome of antidepressant treatment even after
   adjustment for overall depression severity and other clinical
   covariates. The prominence of such symptoms may require additional
   treatment strategies and should be accounted for in future
   investigations of antidepressant response.

AB With the emergence of online publishing, opportunities to maximize
   transparency of scientific research have grown considerably. However,
   these possibilities are still only marginally used. We argue for the
   implementation of (1) peer-reviewed peer review, (2) transparent
   editorial hierarchies, and (3) online data publication. First,
   peer-reviewed peer review entails a community-wide review system in
   which reviews are published online and rated by peers. This ensures
   accountability of reviewers, thereby increasing academic quality of
   reviews. Second, reviewers who write many highly regarded reviews may
   move to higher editorial positions. Third, online publication of data
   ensures the possibility of independent verification of inferential
   claims in published papers. This counters statistical errors and overly
   positive reporting of statistical results. We illustrate the benefits of
   the sestrategies by discussing an example in which the classical
   publication system has gone awry, namely controversial IQ research. We
   argue that this case would have likely been avoided using more
   transparent publication practices. We argue that the proposed system
   leads to better reviews, meritocratic editorial hierarchies, and a
   higher degree of replicability of statistical analyses.

AB The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is increasingly used in

   for depression. However, we know little about its factor structure
   across groups of women with implications for measuring symptom levels in

   using a confirmatory factor analyses model comparison approach of five
   factor models from the literature in a purposive community sample of 169
   postpartum African American women of low socioeconomic status.
   Participants were identified through an exhaustive review of local
   health department program files dated August 2006 to August 2010 in a
   Midwestern state of USA. Tuohy and McVey's (Br JClin Psychol 47:153-169,
   2008) three-factor model (depression, anxiety, and anhedonia)
   demonstrated the best fit to the data with a nonsignificant
   Satora-Bentler scaled chi-square value (21.70, df=24, p=0.60) and the
   lowest root mean square error of approximation (0.00) and standardized
   root mean square residual (0.05) values. The results call for further
   study of the factor structure of the EPDS in other racial and ethnic
   groups and cautious use of the EPDS among perinatal women of racially,
   ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse backgrounds until its
   factorial invariance is better understood.

AB Positive relationships with skilled frontline staff are critical to
   positive youth outcomes (Bouffard & Little, 2004), and yet many youth
   workers are insufficiently prepared to deal with these complex
   environments (Casey Foundation, 2003). There is also concern that there
   is little motivation for frontline youth workers to stay in a field rife
   with danger of burnout, feelings of being overwhelmed, and low pay
   (Anderson-Nathe, 2008; Borden, Craig, & Villaruel, 2004). This article
   establishes the important role higher education can play towards
   stabilizing the youth workforce, and posits that coursework that is
   multidisciplinary, relevant to students' jobs, and supported by
   employers is important to the success of college programs.
   The 12-credit Youth Studies Certificate (YSC) was offered by the City
   University of New York (CUNY) to 223 youth workers from 1999 to 2011.
   Coursework addresses the complex field of youth development by recasting
   traditional courses in education, human services, psychology, sociology,
   development, and recreation. Frontline workers combine their practical
   knowledge of the field with the theoretical framework of a college
   course. Additionally, the certificate is an opportunity to develop
   academically and in critical thinking, skills which enhance a worker's
   development and delivery of service in the practice setting.
   Public/private partnership is an important feature of this replicable
   model aimed to build the stability and capacity of the youth development
   field and the workers within it. Recommendations for replicability and
   future research are provided. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Butterflies are widely used in biodiversity surveys, and several methods
   of relative abundance counts have been developed. The most frequently
   used linear transects are praised for a good replicability, but recently
   have been criticised for poor species detecting ability, especially for
   poorly visible or extremely sedentary species. As an alternative, timed
   surveys, based on zigzagging study sites and flexibly checking transient
   butterfly resources, have been proposed by some authors. We tested the
   utility of the two methods while studying the effect of restoration
   practices on butterfly assemblages in limestone quarries in the Czech
   Republic. Numbers of species and individuals detected per 10 min
   transect walk were compared with numbers of species and individuals
   detected during 10 min timed survey. Mobile and imperceptible species
   were compared in separate analyses as a measure of detection efficiency.
   More species and individuals per visit were recorded by timed surveys.
   No difference in detectability of mobile and imperceptible species
   between both methods used was observed. Whereas linear transects will
   probably remain the method of choice for long-term monitoring programs
   employing armies of recorders, timed surveys appear more appropriate for
   studies in which it is important to obtain the most comprehensive
   check-list of species occurring at study sites, which is often the case
   in conservation inventories in species rich regions with limited number
   of experienced researchers.

AB Recent reports have suggested that many published results are
   unreliable. To increase the reliability and accuracy of published
   papers, multiple changes have been proposed, such as changes in
   statistical methods. We support such reforms. However, we believe that
   the incentive structure of scientific publishing must change for such
   reforms to be successful. Under the current system, the quality of
   individual scientists is judged on the basis of their number of
   publications and citations, with journals similarly judged via numbers
   of citations. Neither of these measures takes into account the
   replicability of the published findings, as false or controversial
   results are often particularly widely cited. We propose tracking
   replications as a means of post-publication evaluation, both to help
   researchers identify reliable findings and to incentivize the
   publication of reliable results. Tracking replications requires a
   database linking published studies that replicate one another. As any
   such database is limited by the number of replication attempts
   published, we propose establishing an open-access journal dedicated to
   publishing replication attempts. Data quality of both the database and
   the affiliated journal would be ensured through a combination of
   crowd-sourcing and peer review. As reports in the database are
   aggregated, ultimately it will be possible to calculate replicability
   scores, which may be used alongside citation counts to evaluate the
   quality of work published in individual journals. In this paper, we lay
   out a detailed description of how this system could be implemented,
   including mechanisms for compiling the information, ensuring data
   quality, and incentivizing the research community to participate.

AB As new analytical techniques are brought to sourcing studies and
   researchers compile data into multi-laboratory databases, systematic
   evaluation is essential. The importance of precision and accuracy is
   clear, but Shackley (2005) also calls for "archaeological accuracy."
   Hughes (1998) offered a framework to consider precision and accuracy
   alongside the concepts of reliability and validity. These four concepts
   can serve as a foundation to evaluate archaeological sourcing data and
   procedures, but adoption of Hughes' framework has been nearly
   nonexistent. Unfortunately, Hughes' formulations of reliability and
   validity are somewhat at odds with their conventional definitions,
   hindering his framework. Furthermore, the concept of precision has
   become outdated in analytical circles, and superfluous terms (e. g.,
   replicability) have emerged in the archaeological literature. Here I
   consider the basis of Hughes' framework and how its four components,
   when applied consistently by the sourcing community, are best applied to
   evaluate analytical data and techniques for sourcing. (C) 2012 Wiley

   components from on a prior investigation of the reliability and
   construct validity of measures of reading component skills (MacArthur,
   Konold, Glutting, & Alamprese, 2010). In that investigation,
   confirmatory factor analysis found that a model with those 5 factors fit
   the data best and fit equally well for native and non-native English
   speakers. The study included 486 students, 334 born or educated in the
   United States (native) and 152 not born nor educated in the US
   (non-native) but who spoke English well enough to participate in English
   reading classes. The cluster analysis found an 8-cluster solution with
   good internal cohesion, external isolation, and replicability across
   subsamples. Of the 8 subgroups, 4 had relatively flat profiles (range of
   mean scores across factors < 0.5 SD), 2 had higher comprehension than
   decoding, and 2 had higher decoding than comprehension. Profiles were
   consistent with expectations regarding demographic factors. Non-native
   speakers were overrepresented in subgroups with relatively higher
   decoding and underrepresented in subgroups with relatively higher
   comprehension. Adults with self-reported learning disabilities were
   overrepresented in the lowest performing subgroup. Older adults and men
   were overrepresented in subgroups with lower performance. The study adds
   to the limited research on the reading skills of ABE learners and, from
   the perspective of practice, supports the importance of assessing
   component skills to plan instruction.

AB Drug discovery for brain disorders is undergoing a period of upheaval.
   Faced with an empty drug pipeline and numerous failures of potential new
   drugs in clinical trials, many large pharmaceutical companies have been
   shrinking or even closing down their research divisions that focus on
   central nervous system (CNS) disorders. In this paper, we argue that
   many of the difficulties facing CNS drug discovery stem from a lack of
   robustness in pre-clinical (i.e., non-human animal) testing. There are
   two main sources for this lack of robustness. First, there is the lack
   of replicability of many results from the pre-clinical stage, which we
   argue is driven by a combination of publication bias and inappropriate
   selection of statistical and experimental designs. Second, there is the
   frequent failure to translate results in non-human animals to parallel
   results in humans in the clinic. This limitation can only be overcome by
   developing new behavioral tests for non-human animals that have
   predictive, construct, and etiological validity. Here, we present these
   translational difficulties as a "grand challenge" to researchers from
   comparative cognition, who are well positioned to provide new methods
   for testing behavior and cognition in non-human animals. These new
   experimental protocols will need to be both statistically robust and
   target behavioral and cognitive processes that allow for better
   connection with human CNS disorders. Our hope is that this downturn in
   industrial research may represent an opportunity to develop new
   protocols that will re-kindle the search for more effective and safer
   drugs for CNS disorders. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: The aim of the present work was to examine the correlated
   eight-syndrome model of the Youth Self-Report (YSR) proposed by Ivanova
   et al [1], using a confirmatory factor analysis for ordinal data.
   Likewise, we explored the measurement invariance of the YSR across
   gender and age using multigroup comparisons, and checked whether there
   were differences in the latent means.
   Methods: The sample was made up of 4,868 nonclinical adolescents (47.6%
   males), with a mean age of 14.6 years (SD = 1.6).
   Results: The correlated eight-syndrome model proposed by Ivanova et al
   [1] showed a reasonable fit to the data, both for the total sample and
   by participants' gender and age. Moreover, the factor-equivalence
   analysis showed that the hypothesized dimensional model was invariant
   across gender and age. Statistically significant differences were found
   when comparing latent means between the groups.
   Conclusions: These results coincide with those found in the literature
   and are in support of the replicability, generalizability, and
   consistency of the eight-syndrome model of the YSR, as well as its
   measurement invariance across gender and age. Future studies should
   explore the measurement invariance of this model through multigroup
   comparisons across cultures. (C) 2012 Society for Adolescent Health and

AB Introduction. The use of manualized treatment programs offers a useful
   research framework for assessing psychotherapeutic interventions for
   female sexual dysfunctions (FSDs), but it does not address all issues
   related to methodological rigor and replication, and raises new research
   issues in need of discussion.
   Aims. The goals of this manuscript are to review the literature on
   treatment trials utilizing manualized psychotherapy treatments for FSD
   and to explore the benefits and research issues associated with the
   flexible use of treatment manuals.
   Methods. The method used was the review of the relevant literature.
   Results. While the use of manualized treatments for FSDs can address
   certain methodological issues inherent in psychotherapy research,
   flexibility in manual administration is necessary in order to allow
   tailoring for individual needs that can be beneficial to both the
   participant and the research. The flexible use of manuals, as opposed to
   strict manual adherence, may also be more relevant for clinical utility.
   Conclusions. In order to administer manualized treatments for FSDs with
   appropriate flexibility, while also maximizing internal validity and
   replicability, the authors recommend that predetermined decision rules
   be utilized to guide individual tailoring, that potential gaps in the
   manual be identified and addressed, and that differing levels of
   motivation and readiness for treatment be taken into consideration in
   the treatment protocol. Hucker A and McCabe MP. Manualized treatment

AB Business processes have become one of the key assets of organization,
   since these processes allow them to discover and control what occurs in
   their environments, with information systems automating most of an
   organization's processes. Unfortunately, and as a result of uncontrolled
   maintenance, information systems age over time until it is necessary to
   replace them with new and modernized systems. However, while systems are
   aging, meaningful business knowledge that is not present in any of the
   organization's other assets gradually becomes embedded in them. The
   preservation of this knowledge through the recovery of the underlying
   business processes is, therefore, a critical problem. This paper
   provides, as a solution to the aforementioned problem, a model-driven
   procedure for recovering business processes from legacy information
   systems. The procedure proposes a set of models at different abstraction
   levels, along with the model transformations between them. The paper
   also provides a supporting tool, which facilitates its adoption.
   Moreover, a real-life case study concerning an e-government system
   applies the proposed recovery procedure to validate its effectiveness
   and efficiency. The case study was carried out by following a formal
   protocol to improve its rigor and replicability. Copyright (C) 2011 John

AB European Union's legislative mandate on road infrastructure safety is
   limited to the cross-border network. In this framework was issued the
   Directive 2008/96/CE on road infrastructure safety management. The
   implementation of the Directive's guidelines is mandatory only for the
   major European cross boarder highways (TEN-T), while it is well known
   that the highest number of fatalities occurs on the "secondary roads"
   not only in Europe but worldwide. To encourage Member States to apply
   the same guidelines also on national and regional road networks, the
   European Commission co-financed a study with the aim to extend the
   Directive's approach through a common training and education of road
   safety auditors and inspectors, entitled to practice at national and
   international level. This approach is a model in every situation where
   there is a need to train and educate a new generation of road safety
   professionals. The shared procedure will lead to a common standard of
   infrastructure safety management, with the appropriate flexibility to be
   adapted to specific local situations. The high replicability of the
   study's results and recommendations will allow a number of European and
   non-European central and local Authorities to set up their own training
   and certification system. The basic training documentation resulting
   from the project can be adapted to be used wherever requested and
   needed, where urgent upgrade and maintenance of the infrastructure asset
   is badly needed.

AB Computer-based aids for writing assistance have been around since at
   least the early 1980s, focussing primarily on aspects such as spelling,
   grammar and style. The potential audience for such tools is very large
   indeed, and this is a clear case where we might expect to see language
   processing applications having a significant real-world impact. However,
   existing comparative evaluations of applications in this space are often
   no more than impressionistic and anecdotal reviews of commercial
   offerings as found in software magazines, making it hard to determine
   which approaches are superior. More rigorous evaluation in the scholarly
   literature has been held back in particular by the absence of shared
   datasets of texts marked-up with errors, and the lack of an agreed
   evaluation framework. Significant collections of publicly available data
   are now appearing; this paper describes a complementary evaluation
   framework, which has been piloted in the Helping Our Own shared task.
   The approach, which uses stand-off annotations for representing edits to
   text, can be used in a wide variety of text-correction tasks, and easily
   accommodates different error tagsets.

AB Through the use of an iterated learning experiment, we investigate the
   emergence of self-organised structure in a random initial alien
   language, as it is replicated through successive `generations' of
   language learners in three distinct iteration chains. Experiments in the
   iterated learning paradigm have frequently shown that languages evolve
   to become more compositional and thus more easily learnable and
   replicable over the course of an iteration chain (see, e.g., Kirby et
   al. 2008). Here, we closely analyse the dynamics of this replication,
   identifying which features actually correlate with greater
   replicability, as well as suggesting which mechanisms may be driving the
   evolution towards a more replicable language. These findings ultimately
   show us that certain very broad generalisations about language structure
   can be explained purely by appeal to the self-organisational dynamics of
   replication through the cognitive environment of individual language
   learners, even prior to taking social and cultural interaction and
   population dynamics into account.

   to evaluate and reconcile data of unknown and varying quality from
   multiple and potentially conflicting sources. Moreover, exceptional
   events may be difficult to incorporate in modelled estimates.
   Computational logic provides a methodology and tools for incorporating
   analyst's judgement, integrating multiple data sources and modelling
   methods, ensuring transparency and replicability, and making
   documentation computationally accessible. Representations using
   computational logic can be implemented in a variety of computer-based
   languages for automated production. Computational logic complements
   standard mathematical and statistical techniques and extends the
   flexibility of mathematical and statistical modelling. A basic overview
   of computational logic is presented and its application to official
   statistics is illustrated with the WHO & UNICEF estimates of national

AB Selecting appropriate suppliers has strategic significance for every

   Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). In many real world applications, data
   are often stochastic. A successful approach to address uncertainty in
   data is to replace deterministic data via random variables, leading to
   chance-constrained DEA. In this paper, a Chance-Constrained FRH (CCFRH)
   model is developed; its deterministic equivalent, which is a nonlinear
   programme, is also derived. Furthermore, it is shown that the
   deterministic equivalent of the CCFRH model can be converted into a
   quadratic programme. In addition, sensitivity analysis of the CCFRH
   model is discussed with respect to changes in parameters. Finally, a
   numerical example demonstrates the application of the proposed model.

AB Metropolitan WiFi positioning is widely used to complement GPS on mobile
   devices. WiFi positioning typically has very fast time-to-first-fix and
   can provide reliable location information when GPS signals are too weak
   for a position fix. Several commercial WiFi positioning systems have
   been developed in recent years and most newer model smart phones have
   the technology embedded. This study empirically determined the
   performance of WiFi positioning system on two different mobile devices.
   Skyhook's system, running on an iPhone and a laptop, was selected for
   this study. Field work was carried out in three cities at a total of 90
   sites. The positional accuracy of WiFi positioning was found to be very
   similar on the two devices with no statistically significant difference
   between the two error distributions. This suggests that the
   replicability of WiFi positioning on different devices is high based on
   aggregate performance metrics. Median values for positional accuracy in
   the three study areas ranged from 43 to 92 m. These results are similar
   to earlier independent evaluations of Skyhook's system. The number of
   access points (APs) observed on the iPhone was consistently lower than
   that on the laptop. This lower number of APs, however, was not found to
   reduce positional accuracy. In general, no relationship was found
   between the number of APs and positional accuracy for either device,
   counter to earlier findings. The results indicate, however, that WiFi
   positioning can be achieved with a small number of APs (5-10), but that
   increased numbers of APs do not contribute to improved positional
   accuracy. Despite the agreement in aggregate performance metrics between
   the two devices, the replicability of WiFi positioning using Skyhook's
   system in terms of getting the same location by using two different
   devices at approximately the same place and time was relatively poor.
   Implications for location-based services on mobile devices are
   discussed.

AB Desertification and sandification monitoring was carried out regularly
   in China, and a large amount of monitoring data was accumulated. It is
   critical to explore the law of succession of desertification and
   sandification by extracting its dynamic information. A dynamic analysis
   solution and technique framework of desertification and sandification
   monitoring data was proposed to avoid the weak points of existing
   dynamic analysis methods. And then, the auxiliary database and dynamic
   database were constructed to ensure the comparability of mass
   multi-period and multi-thematic monitoring data and the accuracy and
   efficiency of dynamic analysis. Meanwhile, a simple and practical
   dynamic analysis program system based on the multi-tier architecture of
   component GIS was developed by utilizing the third and fourth national
   monitoring data. The results show that the dynamic analysis technique is
   effective and feasible and has the characteristics of general
   applicability and replicability to some extent.

AB The temporal annotation scheme Time ML was developed to support research
   in complex temporal question answering (QA). Given the complexity of
   temporal QA, most of the efforts have focused, so far, on extracting
   temporal information, which has been evaluated with corpus-based
   evaluation. However, the QA task represents a natural way to evaluate
   temporal information understanding, and creating question sets is less
   costly for humans than manually annotating temporal information, which
   is required to perform corpus-based evaluation. Additionally, QA
   performance better captures the understanding of important temporal
   information as compared to corpus-based evaluation where all information
   is equally important for scoring. This paper presents a temporal QA
   system that performs temporal reasoning. It can be used to answer
   temporal questions (factoid, list and yes/no), about any document
   annotated in Time ML. In the paper, we show how this system can be used
   to evaluate automated temporal information understanding. Our QA-based
   evaluation results suggest that (i) the available temporal annotations
   are not complete, and (ii) QA provides a less costly and more reliable
   way of evaluating temporal understanding systems. To favour
   replicability, we made the temporal QA system and the question set used
   in the evaluation available.

AB In 1932, Frederic Bartlett laid the foundation for the later schema
   theory. His key assumption of previous knowledge affecting the
   processing of new stimuli was illustrated in the famous "portrait
   d'homme" series. Sequenced reproductions of ambiguous stimuli showed
   progressive object-likeness. As Bartlett pointed out, activation of
   specific schemata, for instance "the face schema", biases memory
   retrieval towards such schemata. In five experiments (Experiment 1, n =
   53; Experiment 2, n = 177; Experiment 3, n = 36; Experiment 4, n = 6;
   Experiment 5, n = 2), we tested several factors potentially influencing
   retrieval biases-for example, by varying the general procedure of
   reproduction (repeated vs. serial) and by omitting versus providing
   visual or semantic cues for activating face schemata. Participants
   inspected face-like stimuli with the caption "portrait of the human" and
   reproduced them repeatedly under specific conditions. None of the
   experiments revealed a systematic tendency towards Bartlett's described
   case, even when the participants were explicitly instructed to draw "a
   face" like the previously inspected one. In one of the "serial
   reproduction" experiments, we even obtained contrary effects with
   decreasing face-likeness over the reproduction generations. A close
   analysis of the original findings raises questions about the
   replicability of Bartlett's findings, qualifying the "portrait d'homme"
   series more or less as an illustrative example of the main idea of
   reconstructive memory.

   the problems associated with large and diverse audiences. The
   replicability, scalability, persistence, and searchability features of
   networked publics influence both how mourners grieve and their control
   over depictions of the deceased. This article analyzes a corpus of posts
   and comments on Facebook memorial pages (N = 37). We examine how the
   social and technical affordances of social media, and Facebook in
   particular, affect public displays of grief and portrayals of the
   deceased. The visibility of social media both encourages performative
   displays of mourning and allows wider audiences to pay respects. This
   openness allows for context collapse and potentially unwelcome
   participants such as trolls. We consider the ways in which the
   publicness of the SNS memorial page affects displays of grieving,
   specifically around efforts to engage in impression management of the
   deceased.

   in-situ investigation,testing and health questionnaire were used for a
   cross-sectional survey in 361 male Gin residents from the
   Sino-Vietnamese border,aged 20-35 years.The response rate for the
   questionnaire was 100%.SPSS 17.0 software was applied to analyze the
   related indicators,and then initial factor model and rotated factor
   model were established for quantitative correlation analysis between the
   morphological characteristics and health quality of life in Gin
   residents from the Sino-Vietnamese border.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION:All the
   data were included in result analysis.Correlation analysis showed a
   higher relevance among indicators,of which,there was a higher
   correlation in 21 coefficients(P < 0.01),and correlation in 14
   coefficients(P < 0.05).Correlation coefficients accounted for 44.48%.The
   main components influencing the body shape and health quality of life in
   border residents were health life basic quality as the first,life
   happiness index as the second,life happiness as the third,and nutrition
   development as the fourth.Using dimension reduction method,we can
   observe the extremely complex correlation between variables to
   objectively evaluate the health quality of life of the minority
   populations of the border.This method is characterized as
   practicality,generalizability and replicability.

AB As the use of computer simulation is increasingly becoming central to
   scientific enterprise, lack of proper documentation, validation and
   distribution of models and experiments may hamper reproducibility and
   hence cause a credibility gap. Building on prior research requires
   ability to reproduce simulation experiments and to further extend models
   to address increasingly challenging problems. In this article, we
   delineate three dimensions of reproducible research. For each dimension,
   issues, strategies and implications for simulation model development are
   identified. From a technical infrastructure point of view, we introduce
   the e-Portfolio concept, which is an ensemble of integrated active
   documents that interweave published manuscript, computer code, data and
   scientific workflow specification. From the process point of view,
   strategies and potential mechanisms are delineated to enable authors,
   publishers, funding agencies, journals and the broader scientific
   community to cooperate and establish a sustained model base,
   simulations, experiments and documentation, so that scientists can build
   on each other's work and achievements.

AB Purpose - Inconsistent research output makes critical literature reviews
   crucial tools for assessing and developing the knowledge base within a
   research field. Literature reviews in the field of supply chain
   management (SCM) are often considerably less stringently presented than
   other empirical research. Replicability of the research and traceability
   of the arguments and conclusions call for more transparent and
   systematic procedures. The purpose of this paper is to elaborate on the
   importance of literature reviews in SCM.
   Design/methodology/approach - Literature reviews are defined as
   primarily qualitative synthesis. Content analysis is introduced and
   applied for reviewing 22 literature reviews of seven sub-fields of SCM,
   published in English-speaking peer-reviewed journals between 2000 and
   2009. A descriptive evaluation of the literature body is followed by a
   content analysis on the basis of a specific pattern of analytic
   categories derived from a typical research process.
   Findings - Each paper was assessed for the aim of research, the method
   of data gathering, the method of data analysis, and quality measures.
   While some papers provide information on all of these categories, many
   fail to provide all the information. This questions the quality of the
   literature review process and the findings presented in respective
   papers.
   Research limitations/implications - While 22 literature reviews are
   taken into account in this paper as the basis of the empirical analysis,
   this allows for assessing the range of procedures applied in previous
   literature reviews and for pointing to their strengths and shortcomings.
   Originality/value - The findings and subsequent methodological
   discussions aim at providing practical guidance for SCM researchers on
   how to use content analysis for conducting literature reviews.

AB The paper addresses the methodological commonalities linking
   quantitative and qualitative methodologies. It offers a three
   dimensional framework of research methodology that spans the assumed
   divide and shows that quantitative and qualitative research approaches
   can be mutually complementary and offer a more nuanced approximation of
   the truth. The framework, Research methodology in 3D, is based on a
   meta-methodological analysis and consists of three root dimensions,
   namely, firstly, four constituent components presented in all forms of
   research (concepts, questions/hypotheses, observation/measurement and
   communication). The second dimension of the framework consists of the
   core set of criteria that all scientific research must comply with
   (reliability, validity, 'objectivity' and replicability), each may be
   expressed under different labels and in different forms depending on the
   specific research tradition. The third dimension represents the basic
   goals of research, viz. to describe, to explain or to understand. A
   three dimensional framework emerges when the above dimensions are
   combined. The framework shows some of the tangent planes between
   quantitative and qualitative scientific research and suggests possible
   complementarity between research approaches. The framework furthermore
   serves at least the following functions: firstly, as map to assist
   students in charting their way through a maze of new concepts. Secondly,
   the framework is a useful planning instrument for comprehensive and
   complex research programmes. Thirdly, the framework can be utilized as a
   useful guide in evaluating research proposals on the one hand and
   research reports, on the other.

AB This paper takes it as its target to optimize the Fisher method of
   monitoring sites in comprehensive assessment of the soil pollution
   situation.To achieve our goal,we have sorted ordinal samples properly to
   make the discrepancies maximization in different categories and
   minimization in the same category.We have also applied the error
   functions relating to the sum total of the category diameters to
   estimate the discrepancy of different categories.After that,we have
   tested the rationality of the above classification results by F-detected
   and t-detected methods.The above steps taken,we began to explore the
   applicability of the optimal sites selection to the comprehensive
   assessment of heavy metals in the soil according to the basic Fisher
   theory.While proceeding with our assessment experiments,we have chosen
   the estuary wetland of Minjiang River in Fujian Province as a case study
   sample.To begin with,we have gained the diameters of various categories
   from a series of calculation of the synthetic pollution indexes and a
   number of the optimized monitoring sites with the changing tendency of
   the minimum error functions.Then,we have taken the situations of
   pollution-causing sources into account to decide on the most desirable
   monitoring locations.The results of our study show that the eight
   original monitoring sites of the estuary wetland along the Minjiang
   River have been optimized into three typical sites,that is,those of
   Langqidaqiao,Shanyutan and Meihuazhen.Combining the detected method with
   the data information analysis of the three sites above,we have finally
   arrived at the conclusion that the comprehensive assessment results of
   heavy metals pollution of the said estuary wetland prove to be able to
   reflect the pollution situation objectively.Though the connotation of
   Fisher method may seem to be intuitive and clear-cut,it is essential to
   help to identify the corresponding management practices in favor of
   improving the soil quality in monitoring network design.It also proves
   to be of great value to the replicability and reliable assessment
   results.The clustering effect of optimized layout for monitoring points
   based on the proposed method was increased due to eliminating redundant
   monitoring sites.From the method we have improved above,it can be seen
   that the Fisher optimal dissection method proves to be a useful
   decision-supporting tool for expanding the application areas in other
   optimized environment monitoring sites selection.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to integrate existing body of
   knowledge on evidence-based management, develop a theory of evidence,
   and propose a model of evidence-based decision making.
   Design/methodology/approach - Following a literature review, the paper
   takes a conceptual approach toward developing a theory of evidence and a
   process model of decision making. Formal research propositions amplify
   both theory and model.
   Findings - The paper suggests that decision making is at the heart of
   management practice. It underscores the importance of both research and
   experiential evidence for making professionally sound managerial
   decisions. It argues that the strength of evidence is a function of its
   rigor and relevance manifested by methodological fit, relevance to the
   context, transparency of its findings, replicability of the evidence,
   and the degree of consensus within the decision community. A multi-stage
   mixed level model of evidence-based decision making is proposed with
   suggestions for future research.
   Practical implications - An explicit, formal, and systematic
   collaboration at the global level among the producers of evidence and
   its users akin to the Cochrane Collaboration will ensure sound evidence,
   contribute to decision quality, and enable professionalization of
   management practice.
   Originality/value - The unique value contribution of this paper comes
   from a critical review of the evidence-based management literature, the
   articulation of a formal theory of evidence, and the development of a
   model for decision making driven by the theory of evidence.

AB Background: Some scientific fields, such as automobile, drugs discovery
   or engineer have used simulation-based studies (SBS) to faster the
   observation of phenomena and evolve knowledge. All of them organize
   their working structure to perform computerized experiments based on
   explicit research protocols and evidence. The benefits have been many
   and great advancements are continuously obtained for the society.
   However, could the same approach be observed in Software Engineering
   (SE)? Are there research protocols and evidence based models available
   in SE for supporting SBS? Are the studies reports good enough to support
   their understanding and replication? AIM: To characterize SBS in SE and
   organize a set of reporting guidelines aiming at improving SBS'
   understandability, replicability, generalization and validity. METHOD:
   To undertake a secondary study to characterize SBS. Besides, to assess
   the quality of reports to understand the usually reported information
   regarding SBS. RESULTS: From 108 selected papers, it has been observed
   several relevant initiatives regarding SBS in software engineering.
   However, most of the reports lack information concerned with the
   research protocol, simulation model building and evaluation, used data,
   among others. SBS results are usually specific, making their
   generalization and comparison hard. No reporting standard has been
   observed. CONCLUSIONS: Advancements can be observed in SBS in Software
   Engineering. However, the lack of reporting consistency can reduce
   understandability, replicability, generalization and compromise their
   validity. Therefore, an initial set of guidelines is proposed aiming at
   improving SBS report quality. Further evaluation must be accomplished to
   assess the guidelines feasibility when used to report SBS in Software
   Engineering.

AB Muslim consumers are concerned about the status of Islamic religious
   requirements of products and services. The producers' ability to trace
   the beginning to end processes will gain the confidence of the consumers
   that the whole processes from the production, processing and
   distribution of the products are Shariah-compliant. Halal traceability
   provides further information about which Halal standards have been
   applied, allows the consumer to verify the Halal claims and ensures that
   the product delivered to the customer is thoyyib (wholesome, healthy,
   safe, nutritious and of good quality). This paper seeks to develop a
   Halal traceability framework for Halal food producers based on Halal
   traceability deployments in a Halal certified food production company.
   The case study method is employed to learn about the initiatives of the
   company in relation to traceability of Halal food production. Based on
   the experience of the studied case, a framework is generated that Halal
   food producers can refer to as a proper guideline to ensure Halal
   compliance along the production, transportation and distribution system.
   The framework has theoretical interest for replicability to other Halal

AB Purpose - In this paper the authors aim to investigate the importance of
   factors for the adoption of free/libre open source software (FLOSS) in
   the public sector. They seek to evaluate how different factors impact
   during the initiation and implementation phases of the adoption process.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors base the methodological
   approach on two exploratory case studies with a contrasting result
   logic. They build a multi-level framework grounded both on literature
   review, and feedback from stakeholders. They then apply the framework to
   two case studies to better frame the findings. They consider phases of
   adoption (initiation, implementation) and the levels of adoption
   (technological, organizational, environmental, individual).
   Findings - In the case studies, the authors found the importance of a
   strong and decision-centric management board to give the impulse for the
   initiation phase of the process. As perceived by the stakeholders, a
   strong governmental support is of paramount importance to increase the
   adoption at the public level, although in the case studies examined the
   initiation stage started from the impulse of a championing management.
   Both case studies passed the initiation phase successfully. Continuous
   employees' training, organizational objectives consensus, and business
   process reengineering have been found important for the implementation
   phase. In the case study in which these factors were not in place, the
   implementation phase of adoption failed. Environmental factors -
   although relevant for the initiation of the adoption process - are less
   significant during the actual implementation of the adoption process, as
   the contrasting result logic from the case studies shows.
   Research limitations/implications - The study refers to two public
   organizations in a specific environmental setting. No causality among
   factors has been inferred. Quantitative objective data have been used to
   determine the success of adoption, for qualitative data multiple sources
   have been used when possible to limit threats to validity.
   Practical implications - The framework can be used by stakeholders in
   public organizations to better frame their adoption strategies and to
   compare results across institutions. Lessons learnt from the case
   studies can be useful to drive future adoptions of FLOSS.
   Originality/value - The framework combines phases of adoption and levels
   making it possible to frame the analysis of the case studies. It has
   been operationalized with a set of metrics, and with a protocol for the
   case studies to increase replicability value.

AB Associations between trajectories of depressive symptoms and subsequent
   tobacco and alcohol use were examined in two samples of girls assessed
   at age 11.5 (T1), 12.5 (T2), and 13.5 (T3). Two samples were examined to
   ascertain if there was generalizability of processes across risk levels
   and cultures. Study 1 comprised a United States-based sample of 100
   girls in foster care; Study 2 comprised 264 girls in a United Kingdom
   community-based sample. Controlling for T1 aggression and T1 substance
   use, individual variation in intercept and slope of depressive symptoms
   was associated with tobacco use at T3 in both samples: greater intercept
   and increases in depressive symptoms increased the risk for T3 tobacco
   use. A similar pattern of associations was found for alcohol use in
   Study 1. The replicability of findings for the prediction of tobacco use
   from trajectories of depressive symptoms suggests potential benefit in
   identifying girls with elevated depressive symptoms for tobacco use
   prevention programs, prior to the transition to secondary school.

AB Objectives and methods: Earlier research indicates that the ability to
   use everyday technology (ET) may be sensitive to subtle functional
   change. People with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have been identified
   as significantly more disabled in ET use compared to controls, albeit
   less disabled than people with dementia. The aim of this study was to
   investigate the replicability of these findings using an improved
   version of the Everyday Technology Use Questionnaire (ETUQ) to compare
   perceptions of relevance and difficulty in ET use in participants with
   MCI or Alzheimer's disease (AD) and controls. Additional aims were to
   explore the validity of ETUQ, and the relationships between perceived
   difficulty in ET use and cognitive status, mood state, and involvement
   in everyday life activities. In total, 118 participants were included,
   37 with AD, 37 with MCI, and 44 controls.
   Results: Analyses confirmed that the rating scale of the ETUQ functioned
   well. The three groups overlapped but differed significantly in their
   perceptions of ETs relevance (p<0.05) as well as of difficulties in ET
   use (p<0.001). Moderate correlations were also found between ETUQ
   measures and cognitive status, mood, and involvement in activities, the
   strongest being that between ETUQ measures and involvement in activities
   (r=0.563).
   Conclusion: Taken together, the findings underscore the plausibility of
   disability already in people with MCI, as the use of ET strongly
   correlates to involvement in activities. It is therefore important that
   professionals who meet older adults with cognitive impairment take this
   aspect of function into account in assessments and targeted
   interventions.

   validating the Zuckerman-Kuhlman-Aluja Personality Questionnaire
   (ZKA-PQ) simultaneously in 4 French-speaking countries. The total sample
   was made up of 1,497 subjects from Belgium, Canada, France, and
   Switzerland. The internal consistencies for all countries were generally
   similar to those found for the normative U.S. and Spanish samples. A
   factor analysis confirmed that the normative structure replicated well
   and was stable within this French-speaking context. Moreover, multigroup
   confirmatory factor analyses have shown that the ZKA-PQ reaches scalar
   invariance across these 4 countries. Mean scores were slightly different
   for women and men, with women scoring higher on Neuroticism but lower on
   Sensation Seeking. Globally, mean score differences across countries
   were small. Overall, the ZKA-PQ seems an interesting alternative to
   assess both lower and higher order personality traits for applied or
   research purposes.

AB In the State of Uttarakhand, availability of safe drinking water has
   been a serious problem. In order to tackle the problem, State government
   installed several rural water supply schemes in the past, but efforts
   could not yield desired results due to lack of community participation
   in operation and maintenance of these schemes. Few years back, State
   government with funding support from World Bank installed Rural Water
   Supply and Environmental Sanitation Projects with NGOs and community
   support. The idea was that with the installation of such projects, time
   used in water collection would be considerably saved which a rural
   household can utilise in economic activities to earn additional income.
   The total income, thus, earned would provide an economic advantage when
   such benefits exceeded the costs incurred in these projects. The
   analysis in the paper focused on two issues. (i) The situational
   analysis of various dimensions of drinking water collection in the
   State. (ii) The cost-benefit analysis of a rural water supply scheme.
   The findings revealed that drinking water collection was arduous and a
   time-consuming activity for the rural households in the State. The
   economic benefits which resulted due to time savings from rural water
   supply scheme were higher than the investment made and rural water
   supply schemes of the Uttarakhand State provided a model of
   replicability in other hilly areas of the country.

AB Methods of research on complex interventions have received increasing
   awareness in nursing and health care science. The British Medical
   Research Council's (MRC) framework on the development and evaluation of
   complex interventions has been widely applied. It does, however, not
   specifically support authors to comprehensively and transparently report
   their complex study to ensure interpretation of study results and
   replicability of the intervention. So far, no reporting criteria for the
   development and evaluation of complex interventions have been published.
   Based on the updated MRC framework and corresponding methodological
   literature, a set of criteria on the reporting and evaluation of complex
   interventions has been developed and reviewed by experts in the field.
   As a result, a criteria list comprising 16 items has been created
   covering the first three stages of the MRC framework: (1) development:
   (2) feasibility and piloting: and (3) introduction of the intervention
   and evaluation. The list provides a minimum standard of criteria
   necessary to ensure high quality reporting of studies on the development
   and evaluation of complex interventions. In a final step, the reporting
   criteria on complex interventions have to pass a formal consensus
   process according to the methods recommended by the EQUATOR network. (C)

AB Experimental ecosystems such as mesocosms have been developed to improve
   the ecological relevance of ecotoxicity test. However, in mesocosm
   studies, the number of replicates is limited by practical and financial
   constraints. In addition, high levels of biological organization are
   characterized by a high variability of descriptive variables. This
   variability and the poor number of replicates have been recognized as a
   major drawback for detecting significant effects of chemicals in
   mesocosm studies. In this context, a tool able to predict precisely
   control mesocosms outputs, to which endpoints in mesocosms exposed to
   chemicals could be compared should constitute a substantial improvement.
   We evaluated here a solution which consists in stochastic modelling of
   the control fish populations to assess the probabilistic distributions
   of population endpoints. An individual-based approach was selected,
   because it generates realistic fish length distributions and accounts
   for both individual and environmental sources of variability. This
   strategy was applied to mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) populations
   monitored in lentic mesocosms. We chose the number of founders as a
   so-called "stressor" because subsequent consequences at the population
   level could be expected. Using this strategy, we were able to detect
   more significant and biologically relevant perturbations than using
   classical methods. We conclude that designing an individual-based model
   is very promising for improving mesocosm data analysis. This methodology
   is currently being applied to ecotoxicological issues.

AB What do we know clinically and empirically about the education of

   supervisor training and supervision have been studied. The importance of
   such matters as training format and methods, supervision topics for
   study, supervisor development, and supervisor competencies are
   considered, and some prototypical, competency-based supervisor training
   programs that hold educational promise are identified and described.
   Twenty supervisor training studies are critiqued, and their implications
   for practice and research are examined. Based on this review of training
   programs and research, the following conclusions are drawn: (1) the
   clinical validity of supervisor education appears to be strong, solid,
   and sound, (2) although research suggests that supervisor training can
   have value in stimulating the development of supervisor trainees and
   better preparing them for the supervisory role, any such base of
   empirical support or validity should be regarded as tentative at best;
   and (3) the most formidable challenge for psychotherapy supervisor
   education may well be correcting the imbalance that currently exists
   between clinical and empirical validity and "raising the bar" on the
   rigor, relevance, and replicability of future supervisor training
   research.

AB INTRODUCTION: Through the Global Plan Towards the Elimination of New HIV
   Infections Among Children by 2015 and Keeping their Mothers Alive,
   leaders have called for broader action to strengthen the involvement of
   communities. The Global Plan aspires to reduce new HIV infections among
   children by 90 percent, and to reduce AIDS-related maternal mortality by
   half. This article summarizes the results of a review commissioned by
   UNAIDS to help inform stakeholders on promising practices in community
   engagement to accelerate progress towards these ambitious goals.
   METHODS: This research involved extensive literature review and key
   informant interviews. Community engagement was defined to include
   participation, mobilization and empowerment while excluding activities
   that involve communities solely as service recipients. A promising
   practice was defined as one for which there is documented evidence of
   its effectiveness in achieving intended results and some indication of
   replicability, scale up and/or sustainability.
   RESULTS: Promising practices that increased the supply of preventing
   mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) services included extending
   community cadres, strengthening linkages with community- and faith-based
   organizations and civic participation in programme monitoring. Practices
   to improve demand for PMTCT included community-led social and behaviour
   change communication, peer support and participative approaches to
   generate local solutions. Practices to create an enabling environment
   included community activism and government leadership for greater
   involvement of communities. Committed leadership at all levels,
   facility, community, district and national, is crucial to success.
   Genuine community engagement requires a rights-based, capacity-building
   approach and sustained financial and technical investment. Participative
   formative research is a first step in building community capacity and
   helps to ensure programme relevance. Building on existing structures,
   rather than working in parallel to them, improves programme efficiency,
   effectiveness and sustainability. Monitoring, innovation and information
   sharing are critical to scale up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Ten recommendations on community engagement are offered for
   ending vertical transmission and enhancing the health of mothers and
   families: (1) expand the frontline health workforce, (2) increase
   engagement with community- and faith-based organizations, (3) engage
   communities in programme monitoring and accountability, (4) promote
   community-driven social and behaviour change communication including
   grassroots campaigns and dialogues, (5) expand peer support, (6) empower
   communities to address programme barriers, (7) support community
   activism for political commitment, (8) share tools for community
   engagement, (9) develop better indicators for community involvement and
   (10) conduct cost analyses of various community engagement strategies.
   As programmes expand, care should be taken to support and not to
   undermine work that communities are already doing, but rather to
   actively identify and build on such efforts.

   to their acceptable fit. Some explanation will be given of how material
   properties affect marginal fit, what the expected longevity of different
   materials is relative to marginal fit, and how marginal fit affects
   development of secondary or marginal caries. Marginal fit is assumed to
   affect restoration longevity by either encouraging or discouraging
   microleakage and development of secondary or marginal caries. Marginal
   fit and its effect on the health of the gingival tissues have been
   reviewed in an earlier paper on polishing and will not be reviewed here.
   Is there some correlation between marginal fit of the various materials
   used in restorative dentistry and this assumption? This paper will
   review the literature found on Medline and present the science behind
   the clinical significance of marginal fit utilizing in vitro studies
   where necessary and in vivo studies whenever possible. Numerous authors

AB Background: This paper has two goals. First, we explore the feasibility
   of conducting online expert panels to facilitate consensus finding among
   a large number of geographically distributed stakeholders. Second, we
   test the replicability of panel findings across four panels of different
   size.
   Method: We engaged 119 panelists in an iterative process to identify
   definitional features of Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI). We
   conducted four parallel online panels of different size through three
   one-week phases by using the RAND's ExpertLens process. In Phase I,
   participants rated potentially definitional CQI features. In Phase II,
   they discussed rating results online, using asynchronous, anonymous
   discussion boards. In Phase III, panelists re-rated Phase I features and
   reported on their experiences as participants.
   Results: 66% of invited experts participated in all three phases. 62% of
   Phase I participants contributed to Phase II discussions and 87% of them
   completed Phase III. Panel disagreement, measured by the mean absolute
   deviation from the median (MAD-M), decreased after group feedback and
   discussion in 36 out of 43 judgments about CQI features. Agreement
   between the four panels after Phase III was fair (four-way kappa =
   0.36); they agreed on the status of five out of eleven CQI features.
   Results of the post-completion survey suggest that participants were
   generally satisfied with the online process. Compared to participants in
   smaller panels, those in larger panels were more likely to agree that
   they had debated each others' view points.
   Conclusion: It is feasible to conduct online expert panels intended to
   facilitate consensus finding among geographically distributed
   participants. The online approach may be practical for engaging large
   and diverse groups of stakeholders around a range of health services
   research topics and can help conduct multiple parallel panels to test
   for the reproducibility of panel conclusions.

AB Because of the relatively recent application of scientific methods to
   the study of persuasion effects-and the consequent replicability of
   those effects-the relationship between governments and students of
   persuasion has changed radically. As is clear from Sara King's (2010)
   article, the U. S. government seeks a beneficial relationship. Not so
   clear is the proper role of the persuasion scientist in that
   relationship. I advocate one such role, that of audience-empowering
   educator. Therein, the goal is not to use persuasion to strengthen the
   desired message artificially but to convince desired audiences to be
   open to processing the message fully.

AB The hybrid populations of peach palm (Bactris gasipaes Kunth) have
   accumulated genetic variability from adjacent landraces, which is
   expected to increase their variability. To test this hypothesis, 176
   plants maintained in the peach palm Germplasm Bank at INPA, including
   four hybrid populations [Belem (n=26); Manaus (n=38); Iquitos, Peru
   (n=41); Yurimaguas, Peru (n=41)], two wild populations (B. gasipaes
   variety chichagui) types 1 (n=21) and 3 (n=7), and two samples of a
   related species, B. riparia, were genotyped with RAPD markers and
   compared to adjacent landraces reported in other studies. Eight RAPD
   primers generated 88 polymorphic and 11 monomorphic markers. The
   replicability test presented a Dice similarity of 0.67, considered
   acceptable. The average heterozygosity of the hybrid populations was
   0.34 and the polymorphism was 87.9%, greater than in the wild
   populations (0.31; 74.7%). The dendrogram of Dice similarities did not
   present groups that clearly correspond to the hybrid populations. The
   gene flow between Iquitos and Yurimaguas (Nm=12.75), and between Iquitos
   and Manaus (Nm=9.47) was high, while between Belem and Manaus it was
   lower than expected (Nm=7.72), probably due to the influence of the
   Solimoes landrace near Manaus. The high value of heterozygosity in
   Manaus seems to be the result of the union of two dispersals after
   domestication: the western Amazonian dispersal, with Iquitos and
   Yurimaguas, and the eastern Amazonian, with Belem, joining in Manaus.
   However, these hybrid populations did not present an accumulation of
   genetic variability expressive enough to differentiate them from the
   landraces.

AB In this methodological commentary, we use Bem's (2011) recent article
   reporting experimental evidence for psi as a case study for discussing
   important deficiencies in modal research practice in empirical
   psychology. We focus on (a) overemphasis on conceptual rather than close
   replication, (b) insufficient attention to verifying the soundness of
   measurement and experimental procedures, and (c) flawed implementation
   of null hypothesis significance testing. We argue that these
   deficiencies contribute to weak method-relevant beliefs that, in
   conjunction with overly strong theory-relevant beliefs, lead to a
   systemic and pernicious bias in the interpretation of data that favors a
   researcher's theory. Ultimately, this interpretation bias increases the
   risk of drawing incorrect conclusions about human psychology. Our
   analysis points to concrete recommendations for improving research
   practice in empirical psychology. We recommend (a) a stronger emphasis
   on close replication, (b) routinely verifying the integrity of
   measurement instruments and experimental procedures, and (c) using
   stronger, more diagnostic forms of null hypothesis testing.

   Objectives: This study aimed to translate, adapting to Brazilian version
   in Portuguese, validate and measure inter and intra-examinator
   reliability and internal consistency of the Thoracic-Lumbar Control
   Scale instrument.
   Setting: State University of Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.
   Methods: This instrument was translated to Brazilian Portuguese by a
   bilingual translator, and it was retranslated to English for conflict
   correction and cultural adaptation. Two physiotherapists were previously
   trained to standardize the scale administration. In all, 22 patients
   were selected and initially assessed through FIM and American Spinal
   Injury Association (ASIA) instruments. Furthermore, they were evaluated
   through the Thoracic-Lumbar Control Scale by two examiners and
   revaluated 1 week after by only one examinator.
   Results: The Brazilian Portuguese version of Thoracic-Lumbar Control
   Scale showed excellent intra and inter-examinator reliability (0.961 and
   0.986), high value of internal consistence (0.934) and significant
   correlation with ASIA sensory score (r = 0.83, P = 0.001).
   Conclusions: The Brazilian Portuguese version of Thoracic-Lumbar Control
   Scale is a valid and efficient instrument to assess trunk control of
   after-spinal cord injury patients, which certifies its replicability by
   other neurology professionals. Spinal Cord (2011) 49, 1198-1202;

AB Discriminant space defining area classes is an important conceptual
   construct for uncertainty characterization in area-class maps.
   Discriminant models were promoted as they can enhance consistency in
   area-class mapping and replicability in error modeling. As area classes
   are rarely completely separable in empirically realized discriminant
   space, where class inseparability becomes more complicated for change
   categorization, we seek to quantify uncertainty in area classes (and
   change classes) due to measurement errors and semantic discrepancy
   separately and hence assess their relative margins objectively.
   Experiments using real datasets were carried out, and a Bayesian method
   was used to obtain change maps. We found that there are large
   differences between uncertainty statistics referring to data classes and
   information classes. Therefore, uncertainty characterization in change
   categorization should be based on discriminant modeling of measurement
   errors and semantic mismatch analysis, enabling quantification of
   uncertainty due to partially random measurement errors, and systematic
   categorical discrepancies, respectively.

AB From the works of Broca and Krogman to modern-day Jantz and Buikstra,
   the orbit has been used for both quantitative and qualitative sex and

   estimations. Orbital height and breadth were measured to determine the
   orbital index and assess differences between men and women or black
   people and white people in the Hamann-Todd Collection. Replicability of
   these measures was also examined. Finally, a geometric morphometric
   study was performed to assess shape differences using the entire margin.
   Significant differences were found in both the index and the
   geomorphometric study; however, further investigation revealed that the
   differences were of little practical use. The measurement differences
   were found to be smaller than intra-observer error, while the geometric
   morphometric analysis demonstrated that minimal percentage of variation
   in shape was attributable to group differences. Thus, these techniques
   should not be used to estimate sex or race.

AB While the use of population-based samples is a common strategy in
   genome-wide association studies (GWASs), family-based samples have
   considerable advantages, such as robustness against population
   stratification and false-positive associations, better quality control,
   and the possibility to check for both linkage and association. In a
   genome-wide linkage study of schizophrenia in Arab-Israeli families with
   multiple affected individuals, we previously reported significant
   evidence for a susceptibility locus at chromosome 6q23.2-q24.1 and
   suggestive evidence at chromosomes 10q22.3-26.3, 2q36.1-37.3 and
   7p21.1-22.3. To identify schizophrenia susceptibility genes, we applied
   a family-based GWAS strategy in an enlarged, ethnically homogeneous,
   Arab-Israeli family sample. We performed genome-wide single nucleotide
   polymorphism (SNP) genotyping and single SNP transmission disequilibrium
   test association analysis and found genome-wide significant association
   (best value of P=1.22x10-(11)) for 8 SNPs within or near highly
   reasonable functional candidate genes for schizophrenia. Of particular
   interest are a group of SNPs within and flanking the transcriptional
   factor LRRFIP1 gene. To determine replicability of the significant
   associations beyond the Arab-Israeli population, we studied the
   association of the significant SNPs in a German case-control validation
   sample and found replication of associations near the UGT1 subfamily and
   EFHD1 genes. Applying an exploratory homozygosity mapping approach as a
   complementary strategy to identify schizophrenia susceptibility genes in
   our Arab Israeli sample, we identified 8 putative disease loci. Overall,
   this GWAS, which emphasizes the important contribution of family based
   studies, identifies promising candidate genes for
   schizophrenia.-Alkelai, A., Lupoli, S., Greenbaum, L., Giegling, I.,

AB Objective: The aim was to study how the measurement error affects the
   repeatability of mismatch negativity (MMN) measurements.
   Methods: Event-related potentials (ERPs) to changes in sound frequency,
   location, intensity, duration, and composition were recorded five times
   during 1-3 weeks from 13 healthy adults using a multi-feature MMN
   paradigm. The accumulation of MMN was modeled empirically with respect
   to measurement error, and repeatability was estimated at 0.6-3.5-mu V
   error levels. The analysis was made for the results in the single
   deviant conditions and their pattern (auditory discrimination profile).
   Results: At the single-subject level, the measurement error
   significantly affected the repeatability until it went below 9-17% of
   MMN peak amplitude. At the group level, the threshold was higher. Peak
   amplitude was generally the most repeatable parameter. Latency was
   superior when the error was moderate or small (<2-3 mu V).
   Conclusions: The measurement error affects the repeatability of MMN. In
   single-subject studies, it should not be neglected if it exceeds 10% of
   the MMN amplitude. The application of the auditory discrimination
   profile is recommended for future applications.
   Significance: The study provided quantitative results to support the
   discussion on improving the repeatability of the MMN measurements. They
   are expected to apply conditionally to other ERP measurements, too. (C)

AB In the void left by the declining popularity of public-private
   partnerships, the concept of 'water operator partnerships' (WOPs) has
   increasingly been promoted as an alternative for improving water
   services provision in developing countries. This paper assesses the
   potential of such partnerships as a 'model' for contributing to the
   MDGs, by focusing on 4 water utilities in Mozambique. Although, the
   study found these partnerships to be successful, it is more sceptical
   about the potential for this type of water operator partnership to
   significantly contribute towards achieving the MDGs. The main reason for
   this is that the replicability of the partnership-model studied in
   Mozambique was found to be quite limited. The case presented in this
   article highlights 3 main lessons for water operator partnerships in the
   water services sector. First, the availability of investment funds is a
   crucial component of a partnership. Without access to such funds the
   impact of such a partnership is likely to be limited. Secondly, the
   level of commitment to the partnership needs to be high if it is to be
   successful. This commitment is likely to take shape in the form of both
   financial commitment as well as commitment of time and effort of the
   organisations involved. Thirdly, even if the partnership is a success,
   the question of how sustainable the achieved performance gains are
   remains a point of concern. All in all, although we acknowledge the
   success achieved by the studied partnership, the findings have made us
   hesitant about the potential for replicating this 'model' at a large
   scale.

AB Regression techniques are versatile in their application to medical
   research because they can measure associations, predict outcomes, and
   control for confounding variable effects. As one such technique,
   logistic regression is an efficient and powerful way to analyze the
   effect of a group of independent variables on a binary outcome by
   quantifying each independent variable's unique contribution. Using
   components of linear regression reflected in the logit scale, logistic
   regression iteratively identifies the strongest linear combination of
   variables with the greatest probability of detecting the observed
   outcome. Important considerations when conducting logistic regression
   include selecting independent variables, ensuring that relevant
   assumptions are met, and choosing an appropriate model building
   strategy. For independent variable selection, one should be guided by
   such factors as accepted theory, previous empirical investigations,
   clinical considerations, and univariate statistical analyses, with
   acknowledgement of potential confounding variables that should be
   accounted for. Basic assumptions that must be met for logistic
   regression include independence of errors, linearity in the logit for
   continuous variables, absence of multicollinearity, and lack of strongly
   influential outliers. Additionally, there should be an adequate number
   of events per independent variable to avoid an overfit model, with
   commonly recommended minimum "rules of thumb" ranging from 10 to 20
   events per covariate. Regarding model building strategies, the three
   general types are direct/standard, sequential/hierarchical, and
   stepwise/statistical, with each having a different emphasis and purpose.
   Before reaching definitive conclusions from the results of any of these
   methods, one should formally quantify the model's internal validity
   (i.e., replicability within the same data set) and external validity
   (i.e., generalizability beyond the current sample). The resulting
   logistic regression model's overall fit to the sample data is assessed
   using various goodness-of-fit measures, with better fit characterized by
   a smaller difference between observed and model-predicted values. Use of
   diagnostic statistics is also recommended to further assess the adequacy
   of the model. Finally, results for independent variables are typically
   reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

   evolved to treat. An approach based in intersubjective systems theory
   can address this problem. The writings of Robert Stolorow (2007) in
   Trauma and Human Existence, which the author first read while deployed
   to Iraq as a psychiatrist, fundamentally changed his understanding of
   trauma and its treatment. The author gives an overview of Stolorow's
   ideas about trauma, and then describes his six-phase short-term
   intersubjective treatment approach. Extensive case material from a
   treatment that occurred in Iraq illustrates each of these phases. The
   author then compares his and Stolorow's views to those of other
   contemporary relational psychoanalytic writers. Future directions
   include the manualization and empirical testing of this approach in
   order to determine its replicability, its utility for therapists who
   lack extensive psychoanalytic training, and its generalizability to
   populations with adult-onset trauma outside the military.

AB Although Resilients, Undercontrollers, and Overcontrollers are
   frequently used in research on personality, their status as replicable
   personality types is not undisputed. This study adds to the debate
   concerning the replicability of these types, by attempting to derive
   them directly from 30 NEO-PI-3 personality facets in a sample of 250
   mid-adolescents. As such, a first description of mid-adolescent
   personality type profiles in terms of personality facets is also
   provided. Results provide remarkable evidence for the replicability of
   Resilients, Undercontrollers, and Overcontrollers from NEO-PI-3
   facet-level data. Furthermore, domain-level differences between types
   were not necessarily reflected in differences across facets underlying
   these domains. Overall, our study can be considered as a demonstration
   of the utility of personality facets and types. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB OBJECTIVE: The present study is concerned with stress distribution in a
   photoelastic model, caused by lower incisor intrusion using utility
   arch. The stress levels on the radicular thirds of each lower incisors
   were compared and the stress concentration differences on each incisor
   were evaluated. METHODS: Fifteen intrusion utility arches were made up.
   The activation force of 50 gf was measured in the midline. The
   photoelastic model was observed using a circular polariscope in a dark
   field configuration, and, then, photographed. Frontal photographs were
   analyzed, and the fringe order in each region was registered. The method
   replicability was assessed by the Kappa weighted analysis. The
   comparison between the stress levels was carried out using
   Kruskall-Wallis test followed by the Dunn test at p<0.05. RESULTS AND
   CONCLUSIONS: The cervical regions were identified with the highest
   stress levels. By comparing the fringe order among the teeth it could be
   concluded that the highest stress levels are located in the central
   incisors. Therefore the cervical region can be more prone to resorptions
   as well as the central incisors, where higher stresses are concentrated.

   inferiores. Compararam-se as tensões entre os terços radiculares de cada
   incisivo e, ainda, verificou-se a existência de diferenças de
   concentrações de tensões entre incisivos. MÉTODOS: foram confeccionados
   15 arcos base de intrusão e a força de ativação foi mensurada em 50gf na
   região da linha média. O modelo fotoelástico foi observado em
   polariscópio circular, na configuração de campo escuro, e fotografado.
   As fotografias frontais foram analisadas e as ordens de franjas em cada

   repetibilidade do método. A comparação entre as tensões foi realizada
   pelo teste de Kruskal-Wallis complementado com teste de Dunn com nível
   alfa de 5%. RESULTADOS E CONCLUSÕES: os resultados identificaram que as
   maiores magnitudes de tensões foram observadas nas regiões cervicais. Ao
   se comparar as ordens de franjas entre os dentes, as maiores magnitudes
   de tensões foram observadas nos incisivos centrais. Portanto, a região
   cervical pode estar mais sujeita a reabsorções, assim como os incisivos
   centrais, por concentrarem maiores tensões.

AB Background. Numerous studies have shown smoothing and inaccuracies in
   handwritten anaesthetic records, but the clinical relevance of these
   findings is unclear. We therefore sought to determine whether the
   behaviour of anaesthetists differed in assessing anaesthetic records
   re-synthesized from either handwritten or automated records.
   Methods. In a recent New Zealand study (ACTRN12608000068369), both
   manual and automated records were acquired from the same anaesthetics.
   Manual records were digitized using digital callipers. Selected data
   (systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure; heart rate; Sp(O2);
   E(CO2)') were replayed in a computerized anaesthetic record-keeping
   system with which the participants were familiar, to present manual and
   corresponding automated anaesthetic records. Ten anaesthetists, randomly
   selected from participants in this study, assessed 24 replayed records
   (a manual and an automated record from each of 10 anaesthetics, with two
   of each displayed twice). They indicated where and how they would have
   intervened if administering these anaesthetics. We compared the number
   of interventions for each pair of anaesthetics and subjective measures
   of anaesthetic quality.
   Results. In our selected sample of unstable anaesthetics, the mean (SD)
   number of interventions per anaesthetic was 4.0 (2.9) vs 5.2 (3.4) for
   manual and automated records, respectively (P=0.013). Subjective
   measures did not differ significantly between record types. Assessors
   identified 32 artifacts in six manual records (0.32/record assessment)
   and 105 artifacts in eight automated records (1.05/record assessment),
   P=0.14. Replicability was moderate (COV 39.8%).
   Conclusions. In comparison with computerized record-keeping, manual
   record-keeping resulted in loss of clinically relevant information.

AB Ramped calibration strips have been suggested as a way for grain
   producers to determine nitrogen needs more accurately. The strips use
   incrementally increasing levels of nitrogen and enable producers to
   conduct an experiment in each field to determine nitrogen needs. This
   study determines whether predictions from the program Ramp Analyzer 1.2
   are replicable in Oklahoma hard red winter wheat (Triticum aestivum).
   Predictions are derived from 36 individual strips from on-farm
   experiments-two pairs of adjacent strips at each of nine winter wheat
   fields in Canadian County, OK. The two pairs of strips within each field
   were between 120 and 155 m apart. Each strip was analyzed three times
   during the 2006-2007 growing season. Nitrogen recommendations from Ramp
   Analyzer 1.2 are not correlated even for strips that were placed side by
   side, and recommendations from strips in the same field show no more
   homogeneity than randomly selected strips throughout the county. The
   results indicate that ramped calibration strips are unlikely to produce
   accurate nitrogen requirement predictions at any spatial scale, whether
   at the county level or for subsections of a single field. In contrast, a
   procedure that uses only measures from the plot with no nitrogen and the
   plot with the highest level of nitrogen applied does show replicability.
   Thus, improvements in the ramped calibration strip technology are needed
   if it is to become viable.

PD SEP 2011
PY 2011
AB Introduction and Objective. The World Food Programme and the Office of
   the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees organized a meeting of
   experts to discuss evaluation of micronutrient interventions under
   special circumstances, such as emergency and refugee situations.
   Results. Multimicronutrient interventions for groups with higher needs
   may include home fortification products for young children or
   supplements for pregnant and lactating women. The choice of preparation
   should be guided by target group needs, evidence of efficacy of a
   product or its compounds, acceptability, and cost-effectiveness.
   Different designs can be used to assess whether an intervention has the
   desired impact. First, program implementation and adherence must be
   ascertained. Then, impact on micronutrient status can be assessed, but
   design options are often limited by logistic challenges, available
   budget, security issues, and ethical and practical issues regarding
   nonintervention or placebo groups. Under these conditions, a
   plausibility design using pre- and post-intervention cross-sectional
   surveys, a prospective cohort study, or a step-wedge design, which
   enrolls groups as they start receiving the intervention, should be
   considered. Post hoc comparison of groups with different adherence
   levels may also be useful. Hemoglobin is often selected as an impact
   indicator because it is easily measured and tends to respond to change
   in micronutrient status, especially iron. However, it is not a very
   specific indicator of micronutrient status, because it is also
   influenced by inflammation, parasitic infestation, physiological status
   (age, pregnancy), altitude, and disorders such as thalassemia and sickle
   cell disease.
   Conclusion. Given the constraints described above, replicability of
   impact in different contexts is key to the validation of micronutrient
   interventions.

AB We study a model of the research process in which the true effect size,
   the replication jitter due to changes in experimental procedure, and the
   statistical error of effect size measurement are all normally
   distributed random variables. Within this model, we analyze the
   probability of successfully replicating an initial experimental result
   by obtaining either a statistically significant result in the same
   direction or any effect in that direction. We analyze both the
   probability of successfully replicating a particular experimental effect
   (i.e., the individual replication probability) and the average
   probability of successful replication across different studies within
   some research context (i.e., the aggregate replication probability), and
   we identify the conditions under which the latter can be approximated
   using the formulas of Killeen (2005a, 2007). We show how both of these
   probabilities depend on parameters of the research context that would
   rarely be known in practice. In addition, we show that the statistical
   uncertainty associated with the size of an initial observed effect would
   often prevent accurate estimation of the desired individual replication
   probability even if these research context parameters were known
   exactly. We conclude that accurate estimates of replication probability
   are generally unattainable.

AB We examined 3 questions surrounding the undercontrolled, overcontrolled,

   originally identified by Block (1971). In analyses of the teacher
   personality assessments of over 2,000 children in 1st through 6th grade
   in 1959-1967 and follow-up data on general and cardiovascular health
   outcomes in over 1,100 adults recontacted 40 years later, we found
   bootstrapped internal replication clustering suggesting that Big Five
   scores were best characterized by a tripartite cluster structure
   corresponding to the ARC types. This cluster structure was fuzzy rather
   than discrete, indicating that ARC constructs are best represented as
   gradients of similarity to 3 prototype Big Five profiles; ARC types and
   degrees of ARC prototypicality showed associations with multiple health
   outcomes 40 years later. ARC constructs were more parsimonious but,
   depending on the outcome, comparable or slightly worse classifiers than
   the dimensional Big Five traits. Forty-year incident cases of heart
   disease could be correctly identified with 67% accuracy by childhood
   personality information alone and stroke incidence with over 70%
   accuracy. Findings support the theoretical validity of ARC constructs,
   their treatment as continua of prototypicality rather than discrete
   categories, and the need for further understanding the robust predictive
   power of childhood personality for midlife health.

AB Molecular methods have become an important tool for studying feeding
   interactions under natural conditions. Despite their growing importance,
   many methodological aspects have not yet been evaluated but need to be
   considered to fully exploit the potential of this approach. Using
   feeding experiments with high alpine carabid beetles and lycosid
   spiders, we investigated how PCR annealing temperature affects prey DNA
   detection success and how post-PCR visualization methods differ in their
   sensitivity. Moreover, the replicability of prey DNA detection among
   individual PCR assays was tested using beetles and spiders that had
   digested their prey for extended times postfeeding. By screening all
   predators for three differently sized prey DNA fragments (range 116-612
   bp), we found that only in the longest PCR product, a marked decrease in
   prey detection success occurred. Lowering maximum annealing temperatures
   by 4 degrees C resulted in significantly increased prey DNA detection
   rates in both predator taxa. Among the three post-PCR visualization
   methods, an eightfold difference in sensitivity was observed. Repeated
   screening of predators increased the total number of samples scoring
   positive, although the proportion of samples testing positive did not
   vary significantly between different PCRs. The present findings
   demonstrate that assay sensitivity, in combination with other
   methodological factors, plays a crucial role to obtain robust trophic
   interaction data. Future work employing molecular prey detection should
   thus consider and minimize the methodologically induced variation that
   would also allow for better cross-study comparisons.

   include the learning of mindfulness skills. The 39-item Five Facet
   Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) has been developed as a reliable and
   valid comprehensive instrument for assessing different aspects of
   mindfulness in community and student samples. In this study, the
   psychometric properties of the Dutch FFMQ were assessed in a sample of
   376 adults with clinically relevant symptoms of depression and anxiety.
   Construct validity was examined with confirmatory factor analyses and by
   relating the FFMQ to measures of psychological symptoms, well-being,
   experiential avoidance, and the personality factors neuroticism and
   openness to experience. In addition, a 24-item short form of the FFMQ
   (FFMQ-SF) was developed and assessed in the same sample and
   cross-validated in an independent sample of patients with fibromyalgia.
   Confirmatory factor analyses showed acceptable model fit for a
   correlated five-factor structure of the FFMQ and good model fit for the
   structure of the FFMQ-SF. The replicability of the five-factor structure
   of the FFMQ-SF was confirmed in the fibromyalgia sample. Both
   instruments proved highly sensitive to change. It is concluded that both
   the FFMQ and the FFMQ-SF are reliable and valid instruments for use in
   adults with clinically relevant symptoms of depression and anxiety.

AB Diverse structural and functional brain alterations have been identified
   in both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, but with variable
   replicability, significant overlap and often in limited number of
   subjects. In this paper, we aimed to clarify differences between bipolar
   disorder and schizophrenia by combining fMRI (collected during an
   auditory oddball task) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data. We
   proposed a fusion method, "multimodal CCA+ joint ICA", which increases
   flexibility in statistical assumptions beyond existing approaches and
   can achieve higher estimation accuracy. The data collected from 164
   participants (62 healthy controls, 54 schizophrenia and 48 bipolar) were
   extracted into "features" (contrast maps for fMRI and fractional
   anisotropy (FA) for DTI) and analyzed in multiple facets to investigate
   the group differences for each pair-wised groups and each modality.
   Specifically, both patient groups shared significant dysfunction in
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and thalamus, as well as reduced white
   matter (WM) integrity in anterior thalamic radiation and uncinate
   fasciculus. Schizophrenia and bipolar subjects were separated by
   functional differences in medial frontal and visual cortex, as well as
   WM tracts associated with occipital and frontal lobes. Both patients and
   controls showed similar spatial distributions in motor and parietal
   regions, but exhibited significant variations in temporal lobe.
   Furthermore, there were different group trends for age effects on
   loading parameters in motor cortex and multiple WM regions, suggesting
   that brain dysfunction and WM disruptions occurred in identified regions
   for both disorders. Most importantly, we can visualize an underlying
   function structure network by evaluating the joint components with
   strong links between DTI and fMRI. Our findings suggest that although
   the two patient groups showed several distinct brain patterns from each
   other and healthy controls, they also shared common abnormalities in
   prefrontal thalamic WM integrity and in frontal brain mechanisms. (c)

AB Pandemic H1N1/2009 influenza virus, derived from a reassortment of
   avian, human, and swine influenza viruses, possesses a unique gene
   segment combination that had not been detected previously in animal and
   human populations. Whether such a gene combination could result in the
   pathogenicity and transmission as H1N1/2009 virus remains unclear. In
   the present study, we used reverse genetics to construct a reassortant
   virus (rH1N1) with the same gene combination as H1N1/2009 virus (NA and
   M genes from a Eurasian avian-like H1N1 swine virus and another six
   genes from a North American triple-reassortant H1N2 swine virus).
   Characterization of rH1N1 in mice showed that this virus had higher
   replicability and pathogenicity than those of the seasonal human H1N1
   and Eurasian avian-like swine H1N1 viruses, but was similar to the
   H1N1/2009 and triple-reassortant H1N2 viruses. Experiments performed on
   guinea pigs showed that rH1N1 was not transmissible, whereas pandemic
   H1N1/2009 displayed efficient transmissibility. To further determine
   which gene segment played a key role in transmissibility, we constructed
   a series of reassortants derived from rH1N1 and H1N1/2009 viruses.
   Direct contact transmission studies demonstrated that the HA and NS
   genes contributed to the transmission of H1N1/2009 virus. Second, the HA
   gene of H1N1/2009 virus, when combined with the H1N1/2009 NA gene,
   conferred efficient contact transmission among guinea pigs. The present
   results reveal that not only gene segment reassortment but also amino
   acid mutation were needed for the generation of the pandemic influenza
   virus.

AB To obtain approval for the use vertebrate animals in research, an
   investigator must assure an ethics committee that the proposed number of
   animals is the minimum necessary to achieve a scientific goal. How does
   an investigator make that assurance? A power analysis is most accurate
   when the outcome is known before the study, which it rarely is. A 'pilot
   study' is appropriate only when the number of animals used is a tiny
   fraction of the numbers that will be invested in the main study because
   the data for the pilot animals cannot legitimately be used again in the
   main study without increasing the rate of type I errors (false
   discovery). Traditional significance testing requires the investigator
   to determine the final sample size before any data are collected and
   then to delay analysis of any of the data until all of the data are
   final. An investigator often learns at that point either that the sample
   size was larger than necessary or too small to achieve significance.
   Subjects cannot be added at this point in the study without increasing
   type I errors. In addition, journal reviewers may require more
   replications in quantitative studies than are truly necessary.
   Sequential stopping rules used with traditional significance tests allow
   incremental accumulation of data on a biomedical research problem so
   that significance, replicability, and use of a minimal number of animals
   can be assured without increasing type I errors.

AB The replicability of an oncolytic virus is measured by its burst size.
   The burst size is the number of new viruses coming out from a lysis of
   an infected tumor cell. Some clinical evidences show that the burst size
   of an oncolytic virus is a defining parameter for the success of
   virotherapy. This article analyzes a basic mathematical model that
   includes burst size for oncolytic virotherapy. The analysis of the model
   shows that there are two threshold values of the burst size: below the
   first threshold, the tumor always grows to its maximum (carrying
   capacity) size; while passing this threshold, there is a locally stable
   positive equilibrium solution appearing through transcritical
   bifurcation; while at or above the second threshold, there exits one or
   three families of periodic solutions arising from Hopf bifurcations. The
   study suggests that the tumor load can drop to a undetectable level
   either during the oscillation or when the burst size is large enough.

   Ambulatory patients, 20 of them aged above 65 years and complaining
   about chronic pain and 20 patients with the age of 40 and younger
   working in a factory were assessed with VAS and MDHAQ. The assessment
   was repeated to investigate the replicability and reliability of both
   tests. According to MDHAQ disability index (DI), the elderly had more
   complains on the first and second day of the study (p < 0.001). In terms
   of changes between first and second days, DI scores of the elderly group
   (r = 0.634; p = 0.003) and the younger group (r = 0.888; p < 0.001) had
   quite similar responses. Criteria for the assessment of pain, fatigue
   and general condition according to MDHAQ were similar in both groups in
   terms of changes between first and second day of the study, there was no
   significant differences between the groups. But while responses in the
   younger group according to these 3 parameters were highly reliable, the
   elderly group's responses were reliable only for their last week pain
   assessment. Both tests were replicable in the elderly group, VAS and
   MDHAQ were especially applicable for the last time phase of their pain;
   while fatigue, general health condition and DI indicated diminished
   reliability in the elderly group, compared to the young group. (C) 2010

AB P>1. Mesocosms are used extensively by ecologists to gain a mechanistic
   understanding of ecosystems based on the often untested assumption that
   these systems can replicate the key attributes of natural assemblages.
   2. Previous investigations of stream mesocosm utility have explored
   community composition, but here for the first time, we extend the
   approach to consider the replicability and realism of food webs in four
   outdoor channels (4 m2).
   3. The four food webs were similarly complex, consisting of diverse
   assemblages (61-71 taxa) with dense feeding interactions (directed
   connectance 0 center dot 09-0 center dot 11). Mesocosm food web
   structural attributes were within the range reported for 82
   well-characterized food webs from natural streams and rivers. When
   compared with 112 additional food webs from standing freshwater, marine,
   estuarine and terrestrial environments, stream food webs (including
   mesocosms) had similar characteristic path lengths, but typically lower
   mean food chain length and exponents for the species-link relationship.
   4. Body size (M) abundance (N) allometric scaling coefficients for
   trivariate taxonomic mesocosm food webs (-0 center dot 53 to -0 center
   dot 49) and individual size distributions (-0 center dot 60 to -0 center
   dot 58) were consistent and similar to those from natural systems,
   suggesting that patterns of energy flux between mesocosm consumers and
   resources were realistic approximations.
   5. These results suggest that stream mesocosms of this scale can support
   replicate food webs with a degree of biocomplexity that is comparable to
   'natural' streams. The findings highlight the potential value of
   mesocosms as model systems for performing experimental manipulations to
   test ecological theories, at spatiotemporal scales of relevance to
   natural ecosystems.

AB Background: Poverty is widely recognized as a major determinant of poor
   health, and this link has been extensively studied and verified. Despite
   the strong evidentiary link, little work has been done to determine what
   primary care health providers can do to address their patients' income
   as a risk to their health. This qualitative study explores the barriers
   to primary care responsiveness to poverty as a health issue in a
   well-resourced jurisdiction with near-universal health care insurance
   coverage.
   Methods: One to one interviews were conducted with twelve experts on
   poverty and health in primary care in Ontario, Canada. Participants
   included family physicians, specialist physicians, nurse practitioners,
   community workers, advocates, policy experts and researchers. The
   interviews were analysed for anticipated and emergent themes.
   Results: This study reveals provider-and patient-centred structural,
   attitudinal, and knowledge-based barriers to addressing poverty as a
   risk to health. While many of its findings reinforce previous work in
   this area, this study's findings point to a number of areas front line
   primary care providers could target to address their patients' poverty.
   These include a lack of provider understanding of the lived reality of
   poverty, leading to a failure to collect adequate data about patients'
   social circumstances, and to the development of inappropriate care
   plans. Participants also pointed to prejudicial attitudes among
   providers, a failure of primary care disciplines to incorporate
   approaches to poverty as a standard of care, and a lack of knowledge of
   concrete steps providers can take to address patients' poverty.
   Conclusions: While this study reinforces, in a well-resourced
   jurisdiction such as Ontario, the previously reported existence of
   significant barriers to addressing income as a health issue within
   primary care, the findings point to the possibility of front line
   primary care providers taking direct steps to address the health risks
   posed by poverty. The consistent direction and replicability of these
   findings point to a refocusing of the research agenda toward an
   examination of interventions to decrease the health impacts of poverty.

AB Background
   Recent studies have raised issues concerning the replicability of gene x
   environment (G x E) interactions involving the monoamine oxidase A
   (MAOA) gene in moderating the associations between abuse or maltreatment
   exposure and antisocial behaviour. This study attempted to replicate the
   findings in this area using a 30-year longitudinal study that has strong
   resemblance to the original research cohort.
   Aims
   To test the hypothesis that the presence of the low-activity MAOA
   genotype was associated with an increased response to abuse exposure.
   Method
   Participants were 398 males from the Christchurch Health and Development
   Study who had complete data on: MAOA promoter region variable number
   tandem repeat genotype; antisocial behaviour to age 30; and exposure to
   childhood sexual and physical abuse.
   Results
   Regression models were fitted to five antisocial behaviour outcomes
   (self-reported property offending; self-reported violent offending;
   convictions for property/violent offending; conduct problems; hostility)
   observed from age 16 to 30, using measures of childhood exposure to
   sexual and physical abuse. The analyses revealed consistent evidence of
   G x E interactions, with those having the low-activity MAOA variant and
   who were exposed to abuse in childhood being significantly more likely
   to report later offending, conduct problems and hostility. These
   interactions remained statistically significant after control for a
   range of potentially confounding factors. Findings for convictions data
   were somewhat weaker.
   Conclusions
   The present findings add to the evidence suggesting that there is a
   stable G x E interaction involving MAOA, abuse exposure and antisocial
   behaviour across the life course.

AB In previous studies event-related potentials and oscillations in
   response to subject's own name have been analyzed extensively on
   group-level in healthy subjects and in patients with a disorder of
   consciousness. Subject's own name as a deviant produces a P3. With
   equiprobable stimuli, non-phase-locked alpha oscillations are smaller in
   response to subject's own name compared to other names or subject's own
   name backwards. However, little is known about replicability on a
   single-subject level.
   Seventeen healthy subjects were assessed in an own-name paradigm with
   equiprobable stimuli of subject's own name, another name, and subject's
   own name backwards. Event-related potentials and non-phase locked
   oscillations were analyzed with single-subject, non-parametric
   statistics.
   No consistent results were found either for ERPs or for the non-phase
   locked changes of oscillatory activities. Only 4 subjects showed a
   robust effect as expected, that is, a lower activity in the alpha-beta
   range to subject's own name compared to other conditions. Four subjects
   elicited a higher activity for subject's own name.
   Thus, analyzing the EEG reactivity in the own-name paradigm with
   equiprobable stimuli on a single-subject level yields a high variance
   between subjects. In future research, single-subject statistics should
   be applied for examining the validity of physiologic measurements in
   other paradigms and for examining the pattern of reactivity in patients.

AB Automated repetitive PCR (rep-PCR; DiversiLab) was compared to PCR
   ribotyping of the 16S-23S RNA intergenic spacer of Clostridium difficile
   (CD) as the "gold standard" method for CD typing. PCR products were
   separated on DiversiLab LabChips (bioMerieux, St. Laurent, Quebec,
   Canada) utilizing a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara,
   CA) operating the DiversiLab v1.4 assay. Bioanalyzer data were exported
   to a secure DiversiLab website and analyzed with DiversiLab v3.4
   software. Replicability of each method was verified by confirming that
   the 5 CD reference strains (RS) formed distinct clusters (CD4, CD6,
   VL0047, VL0013 [ribotype 027], VL0018 [ribotype 001]) by both typing
   methods. Ninety randomly selected clinical isolates (CS) were analyzed
   by both methods: 49 from community-acquired and 41 from
   hospital-acquired cases. A similarity index (SI) of >= 90% was used to
   define clusters when comparing the known RS cluster to the PCR
   ribotyping and rep-PCR patterns of CS. Fourteen different PCR-ribotype
   clusters were identified, but most CS formed 4 major clusters (i.e., CD4
   [15/90; 17%], CD6 [17%], 027 [12%], and 001 [9%]). A total of 7 rep-PCR
   types were identified, but most CS formed 2 major rep-PCR clusters
   (i.e., CD4 [29/90; 32%] and CD6 [23%]); several PCR ribotypes occurred
   within a single rep-PCR cluster. Rep-PCR did not distinguish 027 or 001
   isolates; i) 027 RS strain did not cluster, ii) eleven 027 CS strains
   clustered as CD4, iii) no 027 CS strains clustered with the 027 RS, and
   iv) only 2 001 CS clustered with the RS. Agreement between the
   PCR-ribotype and rep-PCR clusters only occurred for 35/90 (39%) of the
   CS using a rep-PCR SI of >= 90%. Rep-PCR time to results was similar,
   but the annual costs of routinely using this method are 32% higher than
   PCR ribotyping. Routine use of rep-PCR for CD typing is limited by its
   lack of definitive separation of the hypertoxigenic 027 or 001 outbreak
   CD strains. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Aim A pilot scheme was developed to integrate the distribution of
   ready-made near spectacles into primary eye-care delivery in six primary
   healthcare facilities in Zanzibar, East Africa. With the aim of scaling
   it up to national level, the scheme was evaluated in terms of relevance,
   effectiveness, equality, sustainability and replicability.
   Methods Six medical officers were trained in ocular anatomy, history
   taking, blindness definitions, ocular abnormalities, preventable
   blindness, distance visual acuity, near visual acuity, eye examination,
   record keeping and referral criteria. Each clinic was supplied with 200
   near spectacles. The evaluation team revisited the units 6 months later
   to assess the scheme.
   Results The evaluation team recommendations included: a structured
   approach to planning from the outset, facility selection criteria,
   raising awareness through community meetings, funding through a
   revolving fund and the introduction of referral monitoring systems. 372
   of the 574 patients attending the facilities had eye complaints; 285 eye
   infections, 29 distance vision problems and 173 near vision problems.
   173 near vision spectacles were dispensed, and 74 people were referred.
   All medical officers and participants recommended continuing with the
   scheme.
   Conclusions The project is highly relevant and timely, given that
   presbyopia is now a priority with the WHO. The scheme could easily be
   adopted at the national level in Zanzibar and other areas in East
   Africa.

AB Epilepsy is one of the most prevalent neurological disorders, afflicting
   approximately 50 million Indians. Owing to affordability and easy
   availability, use of first-generation antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is
   heavily encouraged for the treatment of epilepsy in resource-limited
   countries such as India. Although first-generation AEDs are at par with
   second-generation AEDs in terms of efficacy, adverse drug reactions
   (ADRs) are quite common with them. This could be attributed to the
   inferior pharmacokinetic parameters such as nonlinear metabolism, narrow
   therapeutic index and formation of toxic intermediates. In addition,
   epilepsy patients may differ in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
   profiles, with about 1/3(rd) of the population failing to respond to
   treatment. A proportion of this interindividual variability in response
   may be explained by genetic heterogeneity in the activity and expression
   of the network of proteins such as metabolizing enzymes, transporters
   and targets of AEDs. Over the last two decades, a considerable effort
   has been made by the scientific community for unraveling this genetic
   basis of variable response to AEDs. However, there have been
   inconsistencies in such genetic association studies conducted across
   different territories of the world. There could be several reasons
   underlying the poor replicability of these studies, mainly nonuniform
   phenotypic definitions, poor sample size and interethnic variability. In
   the present review article, we provide an overview of heterogeneity in
   study designs for conducting pharmacogenetic studies. In addition,
   critical recommendations required for overcoming such challenges imposed
   by pharmacogenetic epidemiological studies have been briefly discussed.

AB Pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) is
   the most common and least satisfactory of the PDD diagnoses. It is not
   formally operationalized, which limits its reliability and has hampered
   attempts to assess its validity. We aimed, first, to improve the
   reliability and replicability of PDD-NOS by operationalizing its
   DSM-IV-TR description and, second, to test its validity through
   comparison with autistic disorder (AD) and Asperger's disorder (AsD). In
   a sample of 256 young people (mean age = 9.1 years) we used
   Developmental, Diagnostic and Dimensional (3Di) algorithmic analysis to
   classify DSM-IV-TR AD (n = 97), AsD (n = 93) and PDD-NOS (n = 66).
   Groups were compared on independent measures of core PDD symptomatology,
   associated autistic features, and intelligence. Contrary to the
   assumption that PDD-NOS is heterogeneous, almost all (97%) of those with
   PDD-NOS had one distinct symptom pattern, namely impairments in social
   reciprocity and communication, without significant repetitive and
   stereotyped behaviors (RSB). Compared to AD and AsD, they had comparably
   severe but more circumscribed social communication difficulties, with
   fewer non-social features of autism, such as sensory, feeding and
   visuo-spatial problems. These individuals appear to have a distinct
   variant of autism that does not merely sit at the less severe end of the
   same continuum of symptoms. The current draft guidelines for DSM-V,
   which mandate the presence of RSBs for any PDD diagnosis, would exclude
   such people from the autistic spectrum. Autism Res 2011, 4: 121-131. (C)

AB When creating a basic biological profile, determining the sex of
   subadult skeletal remains is always problematic and several methods for
   sex determination have been proposed over time. The lateral angle of the
   internal auditory canal has been described as a good sex predictor in
   adults, and here we test its reliability for sex determination of
   subadults. The reliability of this method was, assessed on a sample of
   47 Portuguese known sex and age skeletons representing individuals from
   birth to 15 years of age. The lateral angle was measured on-screen using
   the Adobe Photoshop CS2 (R) software, from photographs of bissected
   lateral angle casts. The measurements were performed by three different
   researchers in order to evaluate intra- and inter-observer variation.
   Our results demonstrate reasonable repeatability and replicability of
   the on-screen measurements. We used a 45 degrees sectioning point to
   allocate individuals in the sample according to sex and attained 62.9%
   accuracy in sex determination using the lateral angle. When broken down
   by age, the least accuracy was observed for the 6-15 years-old group
   (54.5%) and the greatest accuracy was achieved for the 2 -5 years-old
   (75.0%), but still low overall. The use of a sample-specific sectioning
   point did not improve the results. Although sexual dimorphism is
   statistically significant between female and male subadults, the lateral
   angle failed to consistently discriminate individuals according to sex.

AB Implicit measures have contributed to important insights in almost every
   area of psychology. However, various issues and challenges remain
   concerning their use, one of which is their considerable variation in
   reliability, with many implicit measures having questionable
   reliability. The goal of the present investigation was to examine an
   overlooked consequence of this liability with respect to replication,
   when such implicit measures are used as dependent variables in
   experimental studies. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, the authors
   demonstrate that a higher level of unreliability in such dependent
   variables is associated with substantially lower levels of
   replicability. The results imply that this overlooked consequence can
   have far-reaching repercussions for the development of a cumulative
   science. The authors recommend the routine assessment and reporting of
   the reliability of implicit measures and also urge the improvement of
   implicit measures with low reliability.

TI A next-generation sequencing method for overcoming the multiple gene

AB Background: Polyploidy is important from a phylogenetic perspective
   because of its immense past impact on evolution and its potential future
   impact on diversification, survival and adaptation, especially in
   plants. Molecular population genetics studies of polyploid organisms
   have been difficult because of problems in sequencing multiple-copy
   nuclear genes using Sanger sequencing. This paper describes a method for
   sequencing a barcoded mixture of targeted gene regions using
   next-generation sequencing methods to overcome these problems.
   Results: Using 64 3-bp barcodes, we successfully sequenced three
   chloroplast and two nuclear gene regions (each of which contained two
   gene copies with up to two alleles per individual) in a total of 60
   individuals across 11 species of Australian Poa grasses. This method had
   high replicability, a low sequencing error rate (after appropriate
   quality control) and a low rate of missing data. Eighty-eight percent of
   the 320 gene/individual combinations produced sequence reads, and >80%
   of individuals produced sufficient reads to detect all four possible
   nuclear alleles of the homeologous nuclear loci with 95% probability.
   We applied this method to a group of sympatric Australian alpine Poa
   species, which we discovered to share an allopolyploid ancestor with a
   group of American Poa species. All markers revealed extensive allele
   sharing among the Australian species and so we recommend that the
   current taxonomy be re-examined. We also detected hypermutation in the
   trnH-psbA marker, suggesting it should not be used as a land plant
   barcode region. Some markers indicated differentiation between Tasmanian
   and mainland samples. Significant positive spatial genetic structure was
   detected at <100 km with chloroplast but not nuclear markers, which may
   be a result of restricted seed flow and long-distance pollen flow in
   this wind-pollinated group.
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that 454 sequencing of barcoded
   amplicon mixtures can be used to reliably sample all alleles of
   homeologous loci in polyploid species and successfully investigate
   phylogenetic relationships among species, as well as to investigate
   phylogeographic hypotheses. This next-generation sequencing method is
   more affordable than and at least as reliable as bacterial cloning. It
   could be applied to any experiment involving sequencing of amplicon
   mixtures.

AB This two-article sequence on rubber-assisted embossing was aimed to
   understand the basic mechanisms affecting the pattern uniformity and
   replicability and to determine a process window for achieving uniform
   patterning and faithful replication. In Part I, the effects of major
   process and material parameters were identified and studied, and
   strategies for successful hot embossing with rubber as a pressure medium
   were proposed. In Part II, the rubber-assisted embossing process was
   analyzed considering the unique rheological behavior of the materials
   involved to develop useful predictive capabilities for this new process.
   Specifically, a finite-strain hyperelastic formulation was used for
   simulating the isothermal embossing stage, and a generalized Maxwell
   model was used to study the stress relaxation during the holding stage
   and to predict the elastic recovery after demolding. The rheological
   properties obtained in Part I were fitted to the constitutive models and
   implemented in the simulation procedures. The simulation results agreed
   with the major findings in the experimental work and provided a more
   quantitative insight into the process. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 51:601-608,

PY 2011
AB Background: The importance of behaviour change in improving health is
   illustrated by the increasing investment by funding bodies in the
   development and evaluation of complex interventions to change
   population, patient, and practitioner behaviours. The development of
   effective interventions is hampered by the absence of a nomenclature to
   specify and report their content. This limits the possibility of
   replicating effective interventions, synthesising evidence, and
   understanding the causal mechanisms underlying behaviour change. In
   contrast, biomedical interventions are precisely specified (e.g., the
   pharmacological 'ingredients' of prescribed drugs, their dose and
   frequency of administration). For most complex interventions, the
   precise 'ingredients' are unknown; descriptions (e.g., 'behavioural
   counseling') can mean different things to different researchers or
   implementers. The lack of a method for specifying complex interventions
   undermines the precision of evidence syntheses of effectiveness, posing
   a problem for secondary, as well as primary, research.
   We aim to develop a reliable method of specifying intervention
   components ('techniques') aimed at changing behaviour.
   Methods/Design: The research will be conducted in three phases. The
   first phase will develop the nomenclature. We will refine a preliminary
   list of techniques and definitions. Using a formal consensus method,
   experts will then define the key attributes of each technique and how it
   relates to, and differs from, others. They will evaluate the techniques
   and their definitions until they achieve an agreed-upon list of clearly
   defined, nonredundant techniques. The second phase will test the
   nomenclature. Trained experts (primary researchers and systematic
   reviewers), equipped with a coding manual and guidance, will use the
   nomenclature to code published descriptions of complex interventions.
   Reliability between experts, over time, and across types of users will
   be assessed. We will assess whether using the nomenclature to write
   intervention descriptions enhances the clarity and replicability of
   interventions. The third phase will develop a web-based users' resource
   of clearly specified and nonredundant techniques, which will aid the
   scientific understanding of, and development of, effective complex
   interventions. Dissemination throughout the project will be through
   stakeholder meetings, targeted multidisciplinary workshops, conference
   presentation, journal publication, and publication in an interactive
   web-based platform (a Wiki).
   Discussion: The development of a reliable method of specifying
   intervention components aimed at changing behaviour will strengthen the
   scientific basis for developing, evaluating, and reporting complex
   interventions. It will improve the precision of evidence syntheses of
   effectiveness, thus enhancing secondary, as well as primary, research.

   designed studies in the area of stuttering intervention. A total of 23
   randomized controlled trials (RCT) and quasi-experimental studies of
   treatment in the area of stuttering were identified and retrieved from

   the Downs and Black Checklist each study was coded for reporting,
   external validity, internal validity, and internal validity confounding.
   Results of the coding indicated that while overall reporting was
   reasonably complete, the quality of the external and internal validity
   scores was found to be substantively incomplete. This lack of clarity
   and completeness of reporting issues related to the external and
   internal validity makes the interpretation of the findings of individual
   study results problematic and seriously effects the replicability of the
   individual study. Implications of these findings are suggested for both
   researchers and clinicians.

AB Background: Sexual violence is a worldwide problem affecting children
   and adults. Knowledge of trends in prevalence is essential to inform the
   design and evaluation of preventive and intervention programmes. We
   aimed to assess the prevalence of lifetime sexual violence for both
   sexes and to document the prevalence of adult and child abuse by birth
   year in the general population. Methods: National cluster-randomized
   telephone interview study of 3120 adults in Ireland was done. Results:
   Child sexual abuse involving physical contact was reported by 20% of
   women and 16% of men. In adulthood, figures were 20% and 10% for women
   and men, respectively. Prevalence of any form of sexual violence across
   the lifespan was 42% (women) and 38% (men). Analysis by year of birth
   indicated a curvilinear pattern for child sexual abuse with lower
   prevalence in the oldest and youngest participants. Sexual violence in
   young adulthood showed a linear pattern with higher prevalence in the
   youngest participants. Conclusion: The trend of lower rates of
   experience of child sexual abuse in younger adults in the sample is in
   keeping with findings from other countries. The trend of higher rates of
   adult sexual violence in younger adults is worrying, particularly since
   the same participants reported less experience of child sexual abuse
   than the preceding generations. There is a paucity of international data
   addressing the issue of cohort differences in exposure to sexual
   violence. Within-study analysis, and follow-up studies designed to
   maximize replicability, are needed to inform discussion about societal
   trends in different types of sexual violence.

AB Natural isolates of Tobacco mild green mosaic virus (TMGMV) fail to
   infect tomato because the tomato tm-1 protein binds to the replication
   proteins of TMGMV and prevents RNA replication. Previously, we isolated
   a TMGMV mutant that overcomes tm-1-mediated resistance and multiplies in
   tomato plants. Here, we show that the causal mutations in the
   replication protein gene that abolish the interaction with tm-1 reduce
   its ability to suppress RNA silencing in host plant Nicotiana
   benthamiana. The results suggest that the multifunctionality of the
   replication proteins is an evolutionary constraint of tobamoviruses that
   restricts their host ranges.

AB Background
   Recent meta-analyses have raised concerns about the replicability of
   gene x environment interactions involving the serotonin transporter gene
   (5-HTTLPR) in moderating the associations between adverse life events
   and mental disorders.
   Aims
   To use data gathered over the course of a 30-year longitudinal study of
   a New Zealand birth cohort to test the hypothesis that the presence of
   short ('s') alleles of 5-HTTLPR are associated with an increased
   response to life stress.
   Method
   Participants were 893 individuals from the Christchurch Health and
   Development Study who had complete data on: the 5-HTTLPR genotype;
   psychiatric disorders up to the age of 30; and exposure to childhood and
   adult adverse life events.
   Results
   A series of 104 regression models were fitted to four mental health
   outcomes (depressive symptoms, major depression, anxiety disorder and
   suicidal ideation) observed at ages 18, 21, 25 and 30 using 13 measures
   of life-course stress that spanned childhood and adult stressors. Both
   multiplicative and additive models were fitted to the data. No evidence
   was found that would support the hypothesis that alleles of 5-HTTLPR are
   associated with increased responsivity to life stressors.
   Conclusions
   The present findings add to the evidence suggesting that it is unlikely
   that there is a stable gene x environment interaction involving
   5-HTTLPR, life stress and mental disorders.

AB Objective: The speech-evoked auditory brainstem response (ABR) provides
   an objective measure of subcortical encoding of complex acoustic
   features. However, the intrasubject reliability of this response in both
   optimal and challenging listening conditions has not yet been
   systematically documented. This study aimed to evaluate test-retest
   reliability of the speech-evoked ABR in young adults.
   Methods: In each of two sessions, ABRs were obtained with: (1) a 170 ms
   /da/ syllable presented in quiet as well as 2-talker and 6-talker babble
   background noise conditions and (2) a 40 ms /da/ syllable presented in
   quiet. Test-retest reliability of the responses was analyzed in the
   frequency and time domains. Results: The speech-evoked ABR does not vary
   significantly across sessions within individuals on measures of temporal
   encoding (i.e., peak latencies, stimulus-to-response and
   response-to-response measures), frequency representation and response
   magnitude.
   Conclusions: The subcortical auditory pathway produces a response to a
   complex sound that is stable and replicable from session to session.
   Significance: By demonstrating the high degree of replicability in
   optimal and challenging listening conditions, the applicability of the
   speech-evoked ABR may be increased to examining a range of auditory
   processing abilities in clinical and research settings. (C) 2010

AB Background: Searching for associations between genetic variants and
   complex diseases has been a very active area of research for over two
   decades. More than 51,000 potential associations have been studied and
   published, a figure that keeps increasing, especially with the recent
   explosion of array-based Genome-Wide Association Studies. Even if the
   number of true associations described so far is high, many of the
   putative risk variants detected so far have failed to be consistently
   replicated and are widely considered false positives. Here, we focus on
   the worldwide patterns of replicability of published association
   studies.
   Results: We report three main findings. First, contrary to previous
   results, genes associated to complex diseases present lower degrees of
   genetic differentiation among human populations than average genome-wide
   levels. Second, also contrary to previous results, the differences in
   replicability of disease associated-loci between Europeans and East
   Asians are highly correlated with genetic differentiation between these
   populations. Finally, highly replicated genes present increased levels
   of high-frequency derived alleles in European and Asian populations when
   compared to African populations.
   Conclusions: Our findings highlight the heterogeneous nature of the
   genetic etiology of complex disease, confirm the importance of the
   recent evolutionary history of our species in current patterns of
   disease susceptibility and could cast doubts on the status as false
   positives of some associations that have failed to replicate across
   populations.

AB Pandemic H1N1/2009 influenza virus, derived from a reassortment of

   segment combination that had not been detected previously in animal and

   pathogenicity and transmission as H1N1/2009 virus remains unclear. In
   the present study, we used reverse genetics to construct a reassortant
   virus (rH1N1) with the same gene combination as H1N1/2009 virus (NA and
   M genes from a Eurasian avian-like H1N1 swine virus and another six

AB Molecular methods have become an important tool for studying feeding
   interactions under natural conditions. Despite their growing importance,
   many methodological aspects have not yet been evaluated but need to be
   considered to fully exploit the potential of this approach. Using
   feeding experiments with high alpine carabid beetles and lycosid
   spiders, we investigated how PCR annealing temperature affects prey DNA
   detection success and how post-PCR visualization methods differ in their
   sensitivity. Moreover, the replicability of prey DNA detection among
   individual PCR assays was tested using beetles and spiders that had
   digested their prey for extended times postfeeding. By screening all
   predators for three differently sized prey DNA fragments (range 116-612
   bp), we found that only in the longest PCR product, a marked decrease in
   prey detection success occurred. Lowering maximum annealing temperatures
   by 4 A°C resulted in significantly increased prey DNA detection rates in
   both predator taxa. Among the three post-PCR visualization methods, an
   eightfold difference in sensitivity was observed. Repeated screening of
   predators increased the total number of samples scoring positive,
   although the proportion of samples testing positive did not vary
   significantly between different PCRs. The present findings demonstrate
   that assay sensitivity, in combination with other methodological
   factors, plays a crucial role to obtain robust trophic interaction data.
   Future work employing molecular prey detection should thus consider and
   minimize the methodologically induced variation that would also allow
   for better cross-study comparisons.

AB Objective: To establish a colorimetric method to determine the
   antioxidant capacity of water-soluble compounds in functional food based
   on the reaction between 1,10-2 phenanthroline and Fe~(3+) to form yellow
   complexes.Methods: The hydrophilic antioxidants in functional foods were
   extracted with pH 7.4 PBS buffer solution(75 mmol/L) and allowed to
   reduce Fe~(3+) to Fe~(2+).Fe~(2+) was exposed to 1,10-2 phenanthroline
   to form a stable Fe~(2+)-phenanthroline complex.The absorbance of the
   complex was determined on a spectrophotometer at 536 nm and used to
   calculate the antioxidant capacity of water-soluble compounds in
   functional food using Trolox,a water soluble vitamin E analog,as the
   reference standard.The accuracy,linearity,repeatability,recovery rate
   and limit of detection(LOD) of this method were studied,and its
   feasibility was also verified.Results: This method showed a good
   linearity over the Trolox concentration of 0.66-10.53 mumol/L(R2 =
   0.9999).The LOD was 0.54 mumol/L.The replicability and repeatability was
   2.7% and 3.3% relative standard deviation(RSD),respectively.The mean
   spike recovery was(99.94.6)%(n = 5).Conclusion: This method is
   applicable to determine the antioxidant capacity of water-soluble
   compounds in functional food.

AB Epilepsy is one of the most prevalent neurological disorders, afflicting
   approximately 50 million Indians. Owing to affordability and easy
   availability, use of first-generation antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is
   heavily encouraged for the treatment of epilepsy in resource-limited
   countries such as India. Although first-generation AEDs are at par with
   second-generation AEDs in terms of efficacy, adverse drug reactions
   (ADRs) are quite common with them. This could be attributed to the
   inferior pharmacokinetic parameters such as nonlinear metabolism, narrow
   therapeutic index and formation of toxic intermediates. In addition,
   epilepsy patients may differ in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
   profiles, with about 1/3rd of the population failing to respond to
   treatment. A proportion of this interindividual variability in response
   may be explained by genetic heterogeneity in the activity and expression
   of the network of proteins such as metabolizing enzymes, transporters
   and targets of AEDs. Over the last two decades, a considerable effort
   has been made by the scientific community for unraveling this genetic
   basis of variable response to AEDs. However, there have been
   inconsistencies in such genetic association studies conducted across
   different territories of the world. There could be several reasons
   underlying the poor replicability of these studies, mainly nonuniform
   phenotypic definitions, poor sample size and interethnic variability. In
   the present review article, we provide an overview of heterogeneity in
   study designs for conducting pharmacogenetic studies. In addition,
   critical recommendations required for overcoming such challenges imposed
   by pharmacogenetic epidemiological studies have been briefly discussed.

AB The treatment of brain diseases is complicated by the presence of the
   blood-brain barrier. This barrier limits the crossing of therapeutic
   molecules from the blood vessels into the brain. Today, direct
   intracerebral infusion applying convection-enhanced delivery (CED) is
   proposed to circumvent this problem and enhance the area of distribution
   of infusate beyond the parameters of diffusion. Several factors affect
   the efficacy, predictability and replicability of CED, such as the
   catheter model, infusion rate and site of infusion. We set out to
   investigate if probabilistic tractography can be used to model the
   infusion flow and predict the intracerebral movement of molecules. In
   this study we describe a modeling and analysis framework based upon
   probabilistic tractography. This framework was used to compare
   probabilistic tractography modeling and actual CED infusion measurements
   in the putamen of non-human primates, as this gray matter structure is
   proposed as a target for CED treatment of Parkinson's disease.

AB Buildings worldwide account for nearly 40% of global energy consumption.
   The biggest energy consumer in buildings is the Heating, Ventilation and
   Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. HVAC also ranks top in terms of number
   of complaints by tenants. Maintaining HVAC systems in good conditions
   through early fault detection is thus a critical issue. The problem,
   however, is difficult since HVAC systems are large in scale, consisting
   of many coupling subsystems, building and equipment dependent, and
   operating under uncertain conditions. In this paper, a model-based and
   data-driven method is presented for robust system-level fault detection
   with potential for large-scale implementation. It is a synergistic
   integration of (1) Statistical Process Control (SPC) for measuring and
   analyzing variations; (2) Kalman filtering based on gray-box models to
   provide predictions and determine SPC control limits; and (3) system
   analysis for analyzing fault propagation. The method has been tested
   against a simulation model of a 420-meter-high building. It detects both
   sudden faults and gradual degradation, and differentiates faults within
   a subsystem or propagated from elsewhere. Furthermore, the method is
   simple and generic, and should have good replicability and scalability.

AB This paper has a double aim: i) to empirically establish the functions
   naturally expressed by any and those of one of its Spanish counterparts,
   specifically cualquier(a) so as to identify possible cross-linguistic
   transfer; ii) to illustrate a high-performing methodological procedure.
   A set of tools, among them an ad hoc tertium comparationis consisting of
   a set of cross-linguistic labels, a parallel corpus (P-ACTRES) and a
   reference corpus (CREA) are used to explore: i) the uses of any in
   context and the resulting translation environments served by cualquiera;
   ii) the degree of matching between translated cualquier(a) and its
   non-translated usage in standard European Spanish. The corpus-based
   procedure follows basically Krzeszowski's contrastive model (1990) with
   the addition of a 'target language fit' stage (Chesterman, 2004). The
   analysis shows different behaviour in translated and non-translated
   Spanish: Cualquier(a) is underused as a translation option for
   'existential' any and acquires a new function, 'negative', which is not
   a possibility in non-translated language for the same contexts. The
   analysis also corroborates the usefulness and the replicability of the
   methodological procedure.

AB Every year, globally, an estimated 66 500 women die attempting to
   terminate a pregnancy. To the extent that women's lives and futures are
   influenced by childbirth, access to contraception and safe abortion
   services is fundamental to gender equity. Yet many countries legally
   restrict access to safe abortion. In these countries, women with a
   socioeconomic advantage are more able to circumvent restrictive abortion
   laws and access safe abortion services; poor and less educated women are
   more likely to use unsafe methods and suffer serious morbidity and
   death. This is particularly egregious as deaths from unsafe abortion are
   entirely preventable, given access to modern contraception and safe
   abortion services. Bangladesh's Menstrual Regulation (MR) Programme is
   an example of a programme with the potential to reduce morbidity and
   mortality related to unsafe abortion in the context of a restrictive
   abortion law. We describe how Bangladesh's MR Programme evolved from an
   urban-based relief effort in 1972 to a nationwide primary care-level
   programme; review intersectoral processes that have and continue to
   influence policy development and programme implementation; assess the
   impact of the programme; explore contextual factors that have influenced
   the potential of the programme over time; and comment on issues of
   programme sustainability and replicability in settings beyond
   Bangladesh. Available evidence suggests that the MR Programme has
   contributed to a reduction in maternal mortality; however, mortality
   from unsafe abortion continues to disproportionately impact the
   socioeconomically disadvantaged.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine potential differences
   in identity commitment and career success perceptions between casually
   and permanently employed nurses. Specifically, it aims to investigate
   whether casually employed nurses have lower levels of commitment to
   their professional identity, as compared to permanently employed nurses,
   and whether this in turn negatively affects their perceptions of career
   success.
   Design/methodology/approach - Role identity theory was used to predict
   the career success perceptions of casually employed (n = 181) versus
   permanently employed (n = 476) nurses. Data were collected via a
   self-report questionnaire.
   Findings - The data revealed that casual nurses had lower levels of
   identity commitment and more negative career success perceptions.
   Affective commitment fully mediated the relationship between employment
   status and subjective career success.
   Research limitations/implications - Future studies should test the
   replicability of these findings with longitudinal data.
   Originality/value - This paper provides novel insights to the temporary
   employment and careers literatures. Given the previously uncharted
   territory of understanding the role of identity in the career success
   perceptions of different categories of workers, it opens avenues for
   future research, while also answering theoretical questions about the
   identity and career consequences of temporary employment.

AB Systematic Review methodology (SRm) is an increasingly popular choice
   for literature reviews in the Social Sciences. While compared to
   traditional narrative reviews SRm appears time-consuming and laborious,
   transparency and replicability of the methodology is argued to
   facilitate greater clarity of review. Nevertheless, researchers in
   Industrial, Work, and Organizational (IWO) Psychology have yet to
   embrace this methodology. Drawing on experience from conducting a
   Systematic Review (SR) of individual workplace performance we explore
   the premise: The advantages of SRm to IWO Psychology researchers
   outweigh the disadvantages. We offer observations, insights, and
   potential solutions to challenges faced during the reviewing process,
   concluding that SRm is worthwhile for IWO Psychology researchers.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to conduct a systematic review of
   the sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) literature in the
   principal logistics and supply chain management journals, across a
   20-year time frame.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors use a systematic literature
   review methodology. This methodology allows for the minimization of
   researcher bias and the maximization of reliability and replicability.
   The study's empirical validity is further enhanced by demonstrating high
   levels of inter-coder reliability across families of codes.
   Findings - The field of SSCM has evolved from a perspective and
   investigation of standalone research in social and environmental areas;
   through a corporate social responsibility perspective; to the beginnings
   of the convergence of perspectives of sustainability as the triple
   bottom line and the emergence of SSCM as a theoretical framework. While
   the SSCM research has become more theoretically rich and
   methodologically rigorous, there are numerous opportunities for further
   advancing theory, methodology, and the managerial relevance of future
   inquiries.
   Research limitations/implications - The trends and gaps identified
   through our analysis allow us to develop a cogent agenda to guide future
   SSCM research.
   Practical implications - The current perspectives of SSCM hold important
   implications for managers, by directing limited resources toward
   projects which intersect environmental and/or social performance, and
   economic performance.
   Originality/value - The paper provides a systematic, rigorous, and
   methodologically valid review of the evolution of empirical SSCM
   research across a 20-year time period.

AB Background - Polyploidy is important from a phylogenetic perspective
   because of its immense past impact on evolution and its potential future
   impact on diversification, survival and adaptation, especially in
   plants. Molecular population genetics studies of polyploid organisms
   have been difficult because of problems in sequencing multiple-copy
   nuclear genes using Sanger sequencing. This paper describes a method for
   sequencing a barcoded mixture of targeted gene regions using
   next-generation sequencing methods to overcome these problems. Results -
   Using 64 3-bp barcodes, we successfully sequenced three chloroplast and
   two nuclear gene regions (each of which contained two gene copies with
   up to two alleles per individual) in a total of 60 individuals across 11
   species of Australian  Poa grasses. This method had high replicability,
   a low sequencing error rate (after appropriate quality control) and a
   low rate of missing data. Eighty-eight percent of the 320
   gene/individual combinations produced sequence reads, and >80% of
   individuals produced sufficient reads to detect all four possible
   nuclear alleles of the homeologous nuclear loci with 95% probability. We
   applied this method to a group of sympatric Australian alpine  Poa
   species, which we discovered to share an allopolyploid ancestor with a
   group of American  Poa species. All markers revealed extensive allele
   sharing among the Australian species and so we recommend that the
   current taxonomy be re-examined. We also detected hypermutation in the 
   trnH- psbA marker, suggesting it should not be used as a land plant
   barcode region. Some markers indicated differentiation between Tasmanian
   and mainland samples. Significant positive spatial genetic structure was
   detected at <100 km with chloroplast but not nuclear markers, which may
   be a result of restricted seed flow and long-distance pollen flow in
   this wind-pollinated group. Conclusions - Our results demonstrate that
   454 sequencing of barcoded amplicon mixtures can be used to reliably
   sample all alleles of homeologous loci in polyploid species and
   successfully investigate phylogenetic relationships among species, as
   well as to investigate phylogeographic hypotheses. This next-generation
   sequencing method is more affordable than and at least as reliable as
   bacterial cloning. It could be applied to any experiment involving
   sequencing of amplicon mixtures.

AB Background: "The purpose of the present study was to explore further the
   cross-cultural validity, consistency, and replicability of FAIDSS among
   students when assessing HIV/AIDS-related stigma and fear of people
   living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in Lagos metropolis.
   Methods: Using a purposive method, participants in Lagos Metropolis were
   surveyed using a questionnaire and conceptualization derived from the
   work of Ross and Hunter (1992) to measure a variety of HIV-related
   attitudinal and behavioural items. Quantitative data analyzed employing
   factor analysis using maximum-likelihood extraction followed by oblique
   rotation (direct oblimin, delta=0).
   Results: On the factor scale measuring having fear of sex with a
   particular person, younger respondents especially females significantly
   more likely to report greater fear than for any other groups. Our
   findings further suggest that levels of fear of outsiders are high among
   males and need urgent action and intervention at both individual and
   societal levels.
   Conclusion: It is argued that messages and interventions must be
   targeted to promote a positive social environment for those living with
   or affected by HIV/AIDS, and to be useful in understanding stigma, fear
   and prejudice more fully and in reducing them. A crosscurrent behavioral
   change that can transform AIDS from an inevitably fatal pandemic to a
   chronic and manageable disease is the answer.

AB Studies on the determination of trichlorobenzenes (TCBs) and
   2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP) in wastewater of machining have been
   carried out. A gas chromatography/mass spectrometry with selected-ion
   monitoring acquisition method (GC/MS/SIM) was built up followed by the
   dispersive liquid liquid microextraction (DLLME) of the target analytes
   from the matrices. Comparing with some traditional methods, the present
   method was accurate and easier to be operated, with broader linear
   range, better enrichment property, replicability, and less interference.
   Overall recoveries were 92.5~104.3 % with RSD values at 2.3~8.7%. The
   detective limit was 2.0, 6.0, 3.0 and 5.0 mug/L for 1,3,5-, 1,2,4-,
   1,2,3-TCB and 2,4,6-TCP, respectively. Parameters and some important
   factors, which may affect the recoveries and replicabilities for the
   determination of targent analytes, have been investigated. The present
   method has been applied for the determination of the TCBs and 2,4,6-TCP
   residues of 10 real samples. The results showed that 4 of them were
   found to contain TCBs and/or 2,4,6-TCP with concentration at 0.12~1.26

   database had grown to include 145 PWAs and 126 controls from 12 sites
   across the United States. The data and related analysis programs are
   available free over the web.
   Aims: The overall goal of AphasiaBank is the construction of a system
   for accumulating and sharing data on language usage by PWAs. To achieve
   this goal we have developed a standard elicitation protocol, and
   systematic automatic and manual methods for transcription, coding, and
   analysis.
   Methods & Procedures: We present sample analyses of transcripts from the
   retelling of the Cinderella story. These analyses illustrate the
   application of our methods for the study of phonological, lexical,
   semantic, morphological, syntactic, temporal, prosodic, gestural, and
   discourse features.
   Outcomes & Results: AphasiaBank will allow researchers access to a
   large, shared database that can facilitate hypothesis testing and
   increase methodological replicability, precision, and transparency.
   Conclusions: AphasiaBank will provide researchers with an important new
   tool in the study of aphasia.

AB BACKGROUND: Musical performance demands high-leveled coordination,
   concentration, motor- and memory-skills, making it particularly
   susceptible to anxiety states. Researches in this field have advanced
   significantly with the development of specific instruments to evaluate
   music performance anxiety, such as the Kenny Music Performance Anxiety
   Inventory (K-MPAI). OBJECTIVES: The present study has the objective of
   translating, adapting and validating the K-MPAI to the Portuguese
   language. METHODS: After the written consent given by the author of the
   original K-MPAI scale, the K-MPAI scale was translated and validated for
   Portuguese idiom. The Portuguese-version of K-MPAI was then applied to
   218 amateur and professional musicians of both genders. For the
   concurrent validation, the validated Portuguese-version of the State
   Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used. RESULTS: Analysis of the
   internal consistency demonstrated a Cronbach's alpha = 0.957, with p <
   0.001, replicated with p = 0.378 and the concurrent validation with the
   State Trait Anxiety Inventory, demonstrated a Cronbach's alpha = 0.642
   and p < 0.001. DISCUSSION: The study allows evaluating data samples with
   high levels of reliability and replicability, which translates this
   study based on an unbiased sample and replicable to other populations.
   The concurrent validation between K-MPAI and IDATE, allows inferring
   that the scales are comparable in their capability of measuring anxiety
   levels in musicians. 
Y4 CONTEXTO: A performance musical requer alto nível de habilidade em
   diversos parâmetros, como coordenação motora, atenção e memória, o que a
   torna particularmente suscetível aos estados de ansiedade. Pesquisas
   nessa área têm avançado com a introdução de instrumentos específicos
   para abordar a ansiedade na performance musical, como é o caso da Kenny
   Music Performance Anxiety Inventory (K-MPAI). OBJETIVOS: O presente
   estudo teve como objetivo traduzir, adaptar e validar a K-MPAI para a
   língua portuguesa. MÉTODOS: Após autorização da autora, a escala K-MPAI
   foi traduzida e validada. A escala em língua portuguesa foi aplicada a
   218 músicos de ambos os sexos, amadores e profissionais. Para a
   validação concorrente, foi utilizado o Inventário de Ansiedade
   Traço-Estado (IDATE), versão validada na língua portuguesa da State
   Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). RESULTADOS: A análise da consistência
   interna apresentou alfa de Cronbach = 0,957 com p < 0,001,
   reprodutibilidade com p = 0,378 e validação concorrente com a IDATE com
   alfa de Cronbach = 0,642 e p < 0,001. CONCLUSÃO: O estudo permite
   considerar a amostra com graus de confiabilidade e reprodutibilidade
   elevados, o que traduz este estudo como provindo de uma amostra não
   tendenciada e replicável a outras populações. A validação concorrente
   entre a K-MPAI e a IDATE permite inferir que ambas as escalas são
   comparáveis na capacidade de medir os níveis de ansiedade em musicistas.

AB This study aims to examine discourse trends about traditions in Korean
   design. Further, this study examines books containing the views of each
   researcher, articles reported in design magazines, and academic essays
   announced at conferences. The conclusions of this study are as follows.
   Firstly, most design researchers merely assert the appropriateness of
   the modernization of traditional aesthetics; as a result, they have not
   developed design knowledge into a practical stage. Secondly, they have
   not connected the results of traditional aesthetics with design-related
   knowledge such as design philosophy, design methodology, and modeling
   principles. Thirdly, designers' practical usage of the traditions has a
   tendency to repeat the visual appearances of traditions. Finally, since
   around 2000, the discourse on Korean traditions has faded away and the
   discourse on Asian aesthetics has become active. The characteristics of
   these researches show that design researchers had the intention of
   studying traditions, but the results of their researches indicate a lack
   of concreteness and thus are unable to be applied to the fields of
   design practice. In other words, Korean design does not establish Korean
   design principles, design elements, and aesthetics with the requisite
   replicability, universality, and science which would enable them to be
   applied to educational sites and industrial sites of design. The aim of
   this study is to suggest a fundamentally alternative perspective of
   creative resources in the modern design atmosphere by using the
   aesthetics and formativeness of Korean traditional objects.

   단행본이나 비평, 디자인 전문지의 기획과 기사, 학회를 중심으로 한 학술 논문을 고찰하면서 그 특성을 분석하였다. 연구결과에
   의하면 한국 디자인에서 전통에 대한 연구의 흐름과 특성은 다음과 같다. 첫째, 많은 디자인 연구자들이 전통적 미학의 현대화라는
   당위성을 주장하고는 있지만 거대 담론의 단계에 머무르면서 구체적 실천의 단계를 위한 이론을 제공하지 못하고 있다. 둘째, 그간

   대한 디자이너의 활용 방법은 시각적 표피의 재현 위주로 진행되고 있다. 넷째, 2000년대 들어 한국의 전통 논의가 사라지고
   아시아 미학으로 확대되어 논의되고 있다. 이러한 연구 성향의 특성은 전통에 대한 당위적 연구 의지는 있으나, 디자인 실천 영역에서
   활용할 수 있는 구체성을 결여하고 있다고 요약할 수 있다. 다시 말해서 디자인 교육 현장이나 산업 현장에서 사용할 수 있는
   반복가능하며 보편적인 한국적 조형원리나 조형요소, 미학의 정립이 미약하다는 현실을 보여준다는 것이다. 본 연구의 궁극적인 목표는
   한국 전통문화물에 드러난 미학과 조형성을 현대의 디자인 환경에서 창조적인 자원으로 활용할 수 있는 과학적 이론의 정립을 위한

AB Reading ability and specific reading disability (SRD) are complex traits
   involving several cognitive processes and are shaped by a complex
   interplay of genetic and environmental forces. Linkage studies of these
   traits have identified several susceptibility loci. Association studies
   have gone further in detecting candidate genes that might underlie these
   signals. These results have been obtained in samples of mainly European
   ancestry, which vary in their languages, inclusion criteria, and
   phenotype assessments. Such phenotypic heterogeneity across samples
   makes understanding the relationship between reading (dis)ability and
   reading-related processes and the genetic factors difficult; in
   addition, it may negatively influence attempts at replication. In moving
   forward, the identification of preferable phenotypes for future sample
   collection may improve the replicability of findings. This review of all
   published linkage and association results from the past 15 years was
   conducted to determine if certain phenotypes produce more replicable and
   consistent results than others.

AB Background: Poverty is widely recognized as a major determinant of poor
   health, and this link has been extensively studied and verified. Despite
   the strong evidentiary link, little work has been done to determine what
   primary care health providers can do to address their patients' income
   as a risk to their health. This qualitative study explores the barriers
   to primary care responsiveness to poverty as a health issue in a
   well-resourced jurisdiction with near-universal health care insurance
   coverage. Methods: One to one interviews were conducted with twelve
   experts on poverty and health in primary care in Ontario, Canada.
   Participants included family physicians, specialist physicians, nurse
   practitioners, community workers, advocates, policy experts and
   researchers. The interviews were analysed for anticipated and emergent
   themes. Results: This study reveals provider- and patient-centred
   structural, attitudinal, and knowledge-based barriers to addressing
   poverty as a risk to health. While many of its findings reinforce
   previous work in this area, this study's findings point to a number of
   areas front line primary care providers could target to address their
   patients' poverty. These include a lack of provider understanding of the
   lived reality of poverty, leading to a failure to collect adequate data
   about patients' social circumstances, and to the development of
   inappropriate care plans. Participants also pointed to prejudicial
   attitudes among providers, a failure of primary care disciplines to
   incorporate approaches to poverty as a standard of care, and a lack of
   knowledge of concrete steps providers can take to address patients'
   poverty. Conclusions: While this study reinforces, in a well-resourced
   jurisdiction such as Ontario, the previously reported existence of
   significant barriers to addressing income as a health issue within
   primary care, the findings point to the possibility of front line
   primary care providers taking direct steps to address the health risks
   posed by poverty. The consistent direction and replicability of these
   findings point to a refocusing of the research agenda toward an
   examination of interventions to decrease the health impacts of poverty.

AB The biochemistry of RNA-Seq library preparation results in cDNA
   fragments that are not uniformly distributed within the transcripts they
   represent. This non-uniformity must be accounted for when estimating
   expression levels, and we show how to perform the needed corrections
   using a likelihood based approach. We find improvements in expression
   estimates as measured by correlation with independently performed
   qRT-PCR and show that correction of bias leads to improved replicability
   of results across libraries and sequencing technologies.

AB Expanding mental models in order for future conditions to be interpreted
   and shaped more efficiently is a constant strategic challenge for
   social, economic, political, and institutional agents. Accordingly, this
   article discusses the concepts related to future studies and their
   historical trajectory by presenting the various classifications and
   approaches found in the literature characterizing their relations and
   theoretical gaps. Therefore, using the principles of the dialectical
   method, a descriptive theoretical study was conducted using literature
   review as the research method. This study presents a characterization of
   the concepts found in the studies investigated that are considered
   benchmark creating a timeline. Through a comparative analysis of the
   terms found, the focus was developing a conceptual framework suitable
   for the Brazilian scientific scenario concerning future studies. It was
   concluded that this is not a recent topic, and the existing
   concepts/classifications have received several contributions updating
   and expanding its specifications and operational complexities, since the
   1950's. The originally generic approach has been replaced with more
   specific visions related to individual methods of investigation and
   future building achieving greater relevance, consistency, and
   replicability. The adoption of a certain classification (and its
   methods) must result from a historical and cultural identity with the
   context of application. It is believed that this research contributes to
   avoiding and or clearing theoretical misunderstandings, conceptual
   errors, or broad and indiscriminate use of synonymous concepts, which
   are sometimes found in the literature, presenting opportunities for
   future studies technical development. 
Y4 Expandir modelos mentais, de tal modo que as condições futuras possam
   ser interpretadas e conformadas de maneira mais eficiente, constitui-se
   num desafio estratégico constante para agentes sociais, econômicos,

   discutir os conceitos relativos aos estudos do futuro, bem como a
   trajetória histórica do tema, apresentando as diversas nomenclaturas e
   abordagens encontradas até então na literatura, caracterizando suas
   relações e lacunas teóricas. Para tanto, utilizando-se dos princípios do
   método dialético, procedeu-se um estudo teórico de finalidade
   descritiva, que adotou como procedimento de pesquisa a consulta
   bibliográfica. O estudo apresenta uma caracterização de conceitos a
   partir de trabalhos e autores considerados referências no tema,
   constituindo uma cronologia temática. Por meio de uma análise
   comparativa dos termos encontrados, busca-se contribuir com a construção
   de um arcabouço conceitual adequado à aplicação no cenário científico
   brasileiro acerca de estudos do futuro. Conclui-se que o tema tem
   origens remotas e as conceituações/nomenclaturas existentes receberam
   diversas contribuições, atualizando-se e ampliando suas especificações e
   complexidades operacionais, encontrando espaço crescente no meio
   científico a partir da década de 1950. A abordagem originalmente
   genérica tem sido substituída por visões mais específicas, relacionadas
   a métodos próprios de investigação e construção do futuro, ganhando
   maior pertinência, coerência e replicabilidade. A adoção de uma ou outra
   nomenclatura (e seus métodos) deve decorrer de uma identidade histórica
   e cultural com o contexto de aplicação. Acredita-se que essa pesquisa
   aponta um caminho oposto às confusões teóricas, erros conceituais ou uso
   amplo e indiscriminado de conceitos sinônimos, por vezes verificados na
   literatura, indicando ainda algumas oportunidades de desenvolvimento
   técnico sobre os estudos do futuro.

AB This review presents an analysis of the literature on behavioral effects
   of developmental exposure to nicotine, as assessed in rodent models that
   mimic the consequences for human offspring of maternal cigarette
   smoking. Despite the frequency of reports of low birth weight,
   hyperactivity, cognitive deficits, and psychiatric problems,
   inconsistencies exist in both the clinical and experimental literature.
   Confounding socioeconomic and other demographic variables may account
   for discrepancies in clinical reports, and the choice of developmental
   exposure period and the method of nicotine administration may explain
   differences in experimental outcomes. Analysis of a number of variables
   (e.g., physical, behavioral, and cognitive) shows that fetal exposure to
   nicotine does not consistently cause growth retardation or decreased
   birth weight, nor reliably affect motor activity. But combined pre- and
   neonatal exposure is likely to result in delayed reflex development,
   global impairments in learning and memory, and an increased incidence of
   symptoms that model psychiatric illness. There is also support for
   increased self-administration of nicotine and other drugs of abuse in
   animals exposed developmentally to nicotine, as well as potent effects
   on offspring responses to drug challenges. Unlike reports in the
   clinical literature, sexually dimorphic effects were not evident in most
   animal models. Possible neuroanatomical and cholinergic mechanisms
   responsible for behavioral changes are briefly discussed. Statistical
   and design considerations are provided to increase the translational
   value of this research and, most importantly, enhance the replicability
   of reported findings.

AB It is often surprisingly difficult to tell whether a treatment for
   Alzheimer's disease is effective. Biomarkers might offer the potential
   of a quantifiable objective measure of treatment effectiveness. This
   paper suggests several criteria by which biomarkers might be evaluated
   as outcomes measures. These include biological plausibility, statistical
   significance, dose dependence, convergence across measures, and
   replicability. If biomarkers can meet these criteria, then, pending
   regulatory approval, they may have a role in the evaluation of treatment
   effectiveness in Alzheimer's disease. If not, their usefulness may be in
   supplementing, but not supplanting, clinical profiles of treatment
   effects.

AB The promotion of research is one of the main components of the World
   Health Organizations Stop TB Strategy, which includes 'programme-based
   operational research (OR)' and 'research on introducing new tools into
   practice'. The importance of OR in improving tuberculosis (TB) control
   was recognised a long time ago, and historical OR studies have been
   instrumental in the development of major strategies for TB control.
   Although a growing number of OR projects are being conducted in the
   world today, little is known about their results or their likely impact
   on TB control programmes. As funding organisations increasingly
   recognise the need for OR, we propose a rational framework to conduct
   OR, which covers a spectrum from local setting-oriented to international
   policy guiding research, and determines the relevance, replicability and
   generalisability of the results. OR in TB control is aimed at 1)
   improving programme performance; 2) assessing the feasibility,
   effectiveness and impact of new strategies or interventions on TB
   control; and 3) collecting evidence to guide policy recommendations on
   specific interventions. This requires strengthened capacity to plan and
   conduct OR in low-income countries and appropriate support to conduct
   both nationally and internationally led OR projects. Suggestions are
   made for potential steps for improved purpose-driven OR, which may help
   to improve TB control locally and inform policy recommendations
   internationally.

AB BACKGROUND: Numerous genome-wide scans conducted by genotyping
   previously ascertained single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have
   provided candidate signatures for positive selection in various regions
   of the human genome, including in genes involved in pigmentation traits.
   However, it is unclear how well the signatures discovered by such
   haplotype-based test statistics can be reproduced in tests based on full
   resequencing data. Four genes (oculocutaneous albinism II (OCA2),
   tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1), dopachrome tautomerase (DCT), and
   KIT ligand (KITLG)) implicated in human skin-color variation, have shown
   evidence for positive selection in Europeans and East Asians in previous
   SNP-scan data. In the current study, we resequenced 4.7 to 6.7 kb of DNA
   from each of these genes in Africans, Europeans, East Asians, and South
   Asians.
   RESULTS: Applying all commonly used neutrality-test statistics for
   allele frequency distribution to the newly generated sequence data
   provided conflicting results regarding evidence for positive selection.
   Previous haplotype-based findings could not be clearly confirmed.
   Although some tests were marginally significant for some populations and
   genes, none of them were significant after multiple-testing correction.
   Combined P values for each gene-population pair did not improve these
   results. Application of Approximate Bayesian Computation Markov chain
   Monte Carlo based to these sequence data using a simple forward
   simulator revealed broad posterior distributions of the selective
   parameters for all four genes, providing no support for positive
   selection. However, when we applied this approach to published sequence
   data on SLC45A2, another human pigmentation candidate gene, we could
   readily confirm evidence for positive selection, as previously detected
   with sequence-based and some haplotype-based tests.
   CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our data indicate that even genes that are strong
   biological candidates for positive selection and show reproducible
   signatures of positive selection in SNP scans do not always show the
   same replicability of selection signals in other tests, which should be
   considered in future studies on detecting positive selection in genetic
   data.

AB The mixotrophic marine ciliate Mesodinium rubrum possesses a highly
   modified algal endosymbiont as a nutrition source for the species.
   Accordingly, we assumed that the species can reflect the ecotoxicity on
   marine producer (as phytoplankton) and consumer (as zooplankton) both. A
   series of experiments were conducted to identify the potential of the
   species as a standard test species for marine ecotoxicological study. 
   The comparison of species sensitivity on reference toxic materials was
   made using potassium dichromate for phytoplankton and copper chloride
   for zooplankton. The ciliate revealed the highest sensitivity on both
   reference materials among the seven test species including
   phytoplankton, benthic copepod and rotifer species. The toxicity end
   point of the species was 72hr-EC_(50)=1.52 mg/L (as potassium
   dichromate) estimated by population growth inhibition (PGI), which is
   more sensitive than the most sensitive phytoplankton Skeletonema
   costatum (72hr-EC_(50)=3.05 mg/L). As comparison to rotifer, it also
   revealed higher sensitivity on copper chloride; 72hr-EC_(50)=0.38 mg/L
   for ciliate and 48hr-EC_(50)=0.48 mg/L for rotifer. Also, the elutriate
   toxicity test of various ocean disposal wastes were conducted to
   identify the potential of ciliate toxicity test application using
   industrial waste sludges. The toxicity of leather processing waste
   sludge was highest on the ciliate, followed by dyeing waste sludge and
   dye production waste sludge as an increasing order of toxicity.
   72h-EC_(50) of ciliate PGI test was 1.83% and that of S. costatum 3.84%
   for leather waste sludge which showed highest toxicity. The toxicity
   test results also revealed that the highest sensitivity was observed on
   ciliate species on ocean disposed sludge wastes. Also, ciliate toxicity
   test well discriminated the degree of toxicity between sludge sources;
   72h-EC_(50) values were 1.83% for leather processing waste sludge,
   16.75% for dye production waste sludge and 27.75% for textile production
   waste sludge. Even the laboratory culture methods of the species were
   not generally established yet, the species has high potential as the
   standard test species for marine toxicity test in terms of the dual
   reflection of phyto- and zooplankton toxicity from single test,
   sensitivity and test replicability.

AB In previous research, a deliberative process for integrating stakeholder
   perspectives in the ranking of risks was introduced and empirically
   tested with lay groups composed predominantly of Americans. In this
   paper, we explore the viability of this process with lay groups of
   Chinese, because previous research has shown that Americans and Chinese
   differ substantially along many dimensions of cognition and social
   organization relevant to decision-making. Using 10 environmental hazards
   based on current Chinese environmental regulatory programs as the risk
   domain, five groups of 8-9 participants ranked hazards using both
   holistic and multi-attribute approaches. Results show that (1) risk
   rankings from the holistic and multi-attribute approaches are
   consistent, (2) participants indicate that they are satisfied with the
   procedures and resulting rankings, and (3) agreement between
   participants increases over the course of the ranking exercise. Results
   for Chinese participants were compared with previously reported results
   for Americans to look for cultural effects involving deference to
   technical expertise and quantitative analysis, and skepticism toward
   public participation in policy-making. Although there were some hints of
   cultural differences, neither difference significantly affected measures
   of the method's validity or replicability. Because this process offers a
   scientifically sound and measured approach to stakeholder involvement in
   risk management, it may be attractive to Chinese leaders as they respond
   to growing demand for public participation in the policy-making process.
   Whether Chinese citizens would consider the process described here to be
   satisfactory in a real policy context remains to be tested.

AB Much of the current understanding about the pathogenesis of altered
   mood, impaired concentration and neurovegetative symptoms in major
   depression has come from animal models. However, because of the unique
   and complex features of human depression, the generation of valid and
   insightful depression models has been less straightforward than modeling
   other disabling diseases like cancer or autoimmune conditions. Today's
   popular depression models creatively merge ethologically valid
   behavioral assays with the latest technological advances in molecular
   biology and automated video-tracking. This chapter reviews depression
   assays involving acute stress (e.g., forced swim test), models
   consisting of prolonged physical or social stress (e.g., social defeat),
   models of secondary depression, genetic models, and experiments designed
   to elucidate the mechanisms of antidepressant action. These paradigms
   are critically evaluated in relation to their ease, validity and
   replicability, the molecular insights that they have provided, and their
   capacity to offer the next generation of therapeutics for depression.

AB Understanding how genetic variants impact the regulation and expression
   of genes is important for forging mechanistic links between variants and

   statistical interactions among variants that alter gene expression and
   identify 79 genes showing highly significant interaction effects
   consistent with genetic heterogeneity. Of the 79 genes, 28 have been
   linked to phenotypes through previous genomic studies. We characterize
   the structural and statistical nature of these 79 cis-epistasis models,
   and show that interacting regulatory SNPs often lie far apart from each
   other and can be quite distant from the gene they regulate. By using
   cis-epistasis models that account for more variance in gene expression,
   investigators may improve the power and replicability of their genomics
   studies, and more accurately estimate an individual's gene expression
   level, improving phenotype prediction.

AB Background: Current reporting of intervention content in published
   research articles and protocols is generally poor, with great diversity
   of terminology, resulting in low replicability. This study aimed to
   extend the scope and improve the reliability of a 26-item taxonomy of
   behaviour change techniques developed by Abraham and Michie [Abraham, C.
   and Michie, S. (2008). A taxonomy of behaviour change techniques used in
   interventions. Health Psychology, 27(3), 379-387.] in order to optimise
   the reporting and scientific study of behaviour change interventions.
   Methods: Three UK study centres collaborated in applying this existing
   taxonomy to two systematic reviews of interventions to increase physical
   activity and healthy eating. The taxonomy was refined in iterative steps
   of (1) coding intervention descriptions, and assessing inter-rater
   reliability, (2) identifying gaps and problems across study centres and
   (3) refining the labels and definitions based on consensus discussions.
   Results: Labels and definitions were improved for all techniques,
   conceptual overlap between categories was resolved, some categories were
   split and 14 techniques were added, resulting in a 40-item taxonomy.
   Inter-rater reliability, assessed on 50 published intervention
   descriptions, was good (kappa = 0.79). Conclusions: This taxonomy can be
   used to improve the specification of interventions in published reports,
   thus improving replication, implementation and evidence syntheses. This
   will strengthen the scientific study of behaviour change and
   intervention development.

   susceptible to anxiety states. Researches in this field have advanced
   significantly with the development of specific instruments to evaluate
   music performance anxiety, such as the Kenny Music Performance Anxiety
   Inventory (K-MPAI). Objectives: The present study has the objective of
   translating, adapting and validating the K-MPAI to the Portuguese
   language. Methods: After the written consent given by the author of the
   original K-MPAI scale, the K-MPAI scale was translated and validated for
   Portuguese idiom. The Portuguese-version of K-MPAI was then applied to
   218 amateur and professional musicians of both genders. For the
   concurrent validation, the validated Portuguese-version of the State
   Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used. Results: Analysis of the
   internal consistency demonstrated a Cronbach's alpha = 0.957, with p <
   0.001, replicated with p = 0.378 and the concurrent validation with the
   State Trait Anxiety Inventory, demonstrated a Cronbach's alpha = 0.642
   and p < 0.001. Discussion: The study allows evaluating data samples with
   high levels of reliability and replicability, which translates this
   study based on an unbiased sample and replicable to other populations.
   The concurrent validation between K-MPAI and IDATE, allows inferring
   that the scales are comparable in their capability of measuring anxiety
   levels in musicians.

AB This study investigates limitations of the null hypothesis statistical
   significance testing and further introduces the concept of effect size.
   Statistical significance investigated through the null hypothesis
   statistical significance testing cannot be grounds to judge the
   replicability and importance of research and is limited because it is a
   dichotomous criterion. In contrast, effect size estimates, the indices
   for practical significance, overcome the problems of statistical
   significance. Effect size can show the magnitude of difference between
   groups, and moreover, it is beneficial for comparison and accumulation
   of research findings. This study explores recent movements regarding the
   incorporation of effect size in general and then more specifically
   analyzes the trend of the use of effect size in geography education
   research in Korea. In addition, the methods to compute Cohen’s d and
   η^(eta squared), which are likely to be used most frequently in
   geography education research, are introduced.

   student characteristics (demographics, levels of prior mathematics
   knowledge). Analyses revealed statistically significant main effects,
   with student-level effect sizes of .63, .50, and .56. These consistent
   gains support the conclusion that SimCalc is effective in enabling a
   wide variety of teachers in a diversity of settings to extend student
   learning to more advanced mathematics.

AB Social dysfunction in schizophrenia is one of the core negative
   symptoms, which to date is not adequately addressed by treatment with
   both typical and atypical antipsychotics. A number of different
   pharmacological models of social withdrawal are used to mimic social
   dysfunction in rats, such as amphetamine, N-methyl-D-aspartic acid
   antagonists, cannabinergic and serotonergic receptor ligands. The
   purpose of this review is to discuss and compare these models of social
   withdrawal with a focus on their face, construct and predictive
   validities. Various techniques and strategies used to observe and
   analyze rodent social behaviour and other factors that are of relevance
   to this paradigm have also been examined. After comparing the reports,
   we are of the opinion that to improve replicability of any given model
   and its antipsychotic screening potential and the reliability of
   comparisons made, efforts need to be directed towards cross-laboratory
   standardization of variables that may confound experimental outcomes and
   cause discrepancies in results reported. In keeping with an earlier
   suggestion this may be facilitated through the creation of an online
   consortium for behavioural neuroscientists to share and compare
   methodologies, laboratory layouts and perhaps even raw data. Behavioural

AB The empirical study we present here deals with a pedagogical issue that
   has not been thoroughly explored up until now in our field. Previous
   empirical studies in other sectors have identified the opinions of
   researchers about this topic, showing that completely unacceptable
   interpretations have been made of significance tests and other
   statistical resources. We tried to show the degree to which these errors
   of interpretation appear in a sample of university professors and
   researchers. To evaluate the beliefs and opinions of the university
   professors about certain methodological and statistical questions, we
   adapted the "Psychometrics Group Instrument" questionnaire by Mittag
   (1999) and Mittag and Thompson (Educational Researcher 29:14-20, 2000).
   We specifically wanted to detect opinions about: (1) avoiding
   inappropriate interpretations, (2) rectifying incorrect uses, (3)
   creating a debate on possible alternatives, and (4) proposing editorial
   changes in the publication criteria. In this study, we compare the
   results we obtained with those obtained by two other equivalent studies
   (Gordon, Journal of Vocational Educational Research 26:1-18, 2001;
   Mittag and Thompson, Educational Researcher 29:14-20, 2000). The
   characteristics of the sample and the scope of the results are
   described, and a critical reflection is carried out on typical
   misunderstandings in interpretation that show a worrisome lack of
   understanding of some basic methodological and statistical concepts.

AB The aim of this paper is to make the case for a systematic engagement of
   transition studies with complexity theory and research. We argue that
   transition research is important for the understanding and development
   of possible sustainable future pathways. However, there are several
   controversies in transition research, including, the role of agency in
   transitions; the relationships between levels (niche, regime and
   landscapes); the origin of transitions; the identification of a
   transition, including starting and ending point of transition processes;
   and the paradox of replicability and scaling up of independent
   experiments. We argue that transition research, and future studies can
   benefit from taking complexity theory seriously. In the paper, we
   elaborate four insights from complexity studies that can move the
   research agenda of transition studies forward: empirically investigating
   the degree of complexity of a system; investigating complexity at the
   level of the policy-making system; longitudinal and retrospective
   research designs for the identification of transitions; methodological
   tools which accommodate complexity, such as agent-based modeling and
   ARIMA modeling. Further, we suggest how these can improve our knowledge
   of transitions towards sustainable future. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate by means of classical test
   theory and Rasch analysis the scaling characteristics and psychometric
   properties of the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) in polio survivors. A
   questionnaire, consisting of five general questions (sex, age, age at
   time of acute polio, sequelae of polio, and new symptoms), the FSS, and
   three questions from the Visual Analog Scale questions on fatigue was
   sent to all 196 polio survivors at the Institute for Rehabilitation in
   Ljubljana. Responses were assessed in terms of Cronbach's alpha,
   item-to-total correlation, factor analysis, and Rasch analysis. Of the
   128 (65.3%) valid questionnaires returned, those presenting no missing
   values were used for subsequent analyses (n = 117). The FSS showed good
   internal consistency: Cronbach's alpha was greater than 0.95,
   item-to-total correlation ranged from 0.68 to 0.88. A reduction from
   seven to three rating categories was necessary to comply with criteria
   for correct category function. Item difficulty estimates spanned from -
   0.91 to + 1.09 logits. No item bias was found for sex and age. The
   internal consistency of FSS was high and its item separation reliability
   good, indicating a satisfactory replicability of item placement in other
   samples. In conclusion, Rasch analysis enabled us to confirm the
   validity of FSS (in its 8-item version, without item 1) as a measure of
   the severity and impact of physical symptoms of fatigue in polio
   survivors, so providing a useful starting point for further studies
   aimed at examining additional psychometric aspects and confirming the
   appropriateness of the simplification of its rating categories.

AB The effectiveness of computer speech recognition as an objective measure
   of intelligibility was explored. A commercially available program was
   assessed following the manufacturer's protocol to analyze speech samples
   from three speakers without neurogenic speech disorders, one speaker
   with moderate spastic dysarthria, and a synthesized speech sample. The
   system identified the synthesized speech most accurately, and the speech
   of the speaker with dysarthria least accurately. To improve clinical
   relevance, a variation of the recommended protocol was performed. The
   first author provided a referent speech sample, and typically used
   intelligibility tests produced by three speakers with dysarthria were
   assessed. These results were compared with intelligibility judgments
   from a large number of everyday listeners. Compared to the everyday
   listener results, the software judged all samples much less accurately.
   Single word intelligibility was particularly disparate because of the
   prediction model used by the recognition system. In addition,
   replicability was poorer than expected, again, due to the prediction
   model. Further work, modifying the software's referent sample as well as
   assessing other recognition programs, is proposed. These programs have
   the potential for providing reliable pre-post therapy analysis and a
   stable point of comparison across clinicians and settings.

AB Objectives To demonstrate a statistical analysis for testing the

   survey instrument examined in the present study is the Medication
   Administration Error Reporting Survey.
   Methods Surveys were posted to a random sample of registered nurses in
   the State of Texas, with 435 nurses completing the survey. The surveys
   contained questions about various error reporting issues, including the
   16-item, Medication Administration Error Reporting scale. Nurses were
   divided into one of two samples-calibration and holdout-to ensure
   replicability of the results. Within each sample, two groups were
   created based on nurse tenure on the job.
   Results Multiple Group Confirmatory Factor Analysis was conducted across
   nurses with varying levels of experience for the calibration and holdout
   samples. For each sample, a baseline model was estimated, where model
   parameters were allowed to vary across the nursing groups, and compared
   with more restrictive models. The results provided support for the
   factor structure of the Medication Administration Error Reporting System
   but yielded mixed results concerning the equivalence of the measure
   across nursing groups.
   Conclusions The present study provides an explanation of how to examine
   the measurement equivalence of survey instruments and demonstrated that
   the Medication Administration Error Reporting scale might not be
   equivalent across nurses who differ with respect to experience levels.

   this topic has been limited in a number of important ways. In this
   paper, I develop a behavioral typology based on students' course-taking
   and other enrollment patterns during a seven-year observation period.
   Drawing on data for a population of 165,921 first-time college students,
   I identify six clusters of behaviors: transfer, vocational, drop-in,
   noncredit, experimental, and exploratory. I describe each of these
   student types in terms of distinguishing course-taking and enrollment
   behaviors, representation in the first-time student cohort, predominant
   demographic characteristics, and self-reported academic goal. I test the
   predictive validity of the classification scheme with respect to
   long-term academic outcomes. I investigate the relationships between the
   primary classification scheme and several alternative classification
   schemes. Finally, I demonstrate the replicability of the classification
   scheme with an alternate cohort of students.

PD OCT 28 2010

AB Background: MS-pathogenesis is known to involve both multiple
   environmental events, and several independent genetic risk-factors.
   Methods: A model of susceptibility is developed and a mathematical
   analysis undertaken to elucidate the nature of genetic susceptibility to
   MS and to understand the constraints that are placed on the genetic
   basis of MS, both by the known epidemiological facts of this disease and
   by the known frequency of the HLA DRB1*1501 allele in the general
   populations of northern Europe and North America.
   Results: For the large majority of cases (possibly all), MS develops, in
   part, because an individual is genetically susceptible. Nevertheless,
   2.2% or less of the general population is genetically susceptible.
   Moreover, from the model, the number of susceptibility-loci that need to
   be in a "susceptible allelic state" to produce MS-susceptibility is
   small (11-18), whereas the total number of such susceptibility-loci is
   large (50-200), and their "frequency of susceptibility" is low (i.e., <=
   0.12). The optimal solution to the model equations (which occurs when
   80% of the loci are recessive) predicts the epidemiological data quite
   closely.
   Conclusions: The model suggests that combinations of only a small number
   of genetic loci in a "susceptible allelic state" produce
   MS-susceptibility. Nevertheless, genome-wide associations studies with
   hundreds of thousands of SNPs, are plagued by both false-positive and
   false-negative identifications and, consequently, emphasis has been
   rightly placed on the replicability of findings. Nevertheless, because
   genome-wide screens don't distinguish between true susceptibility-loci
   and disease-modifying-loci, and because only true susceptibility-loci
   are constrained by the model, unraveling the two will not be possible
   using this approach. The model also suggests that HLA DRB1 may not be as
   uniquely important for MS-susceptibility as currently believed. Thus,
   this allele is only one among a hundred or more loci involved in MS
   susceptibility. Even though the "frequency of susceptibility" at the HLA
   DRB1 locus is four-fold that of other loci, the penetrance of those
   susceptible genotypes that include this allele is no different from
   those that don't. Also, almost 50% of genetically-susceptible
   individuals, lack this allele. Moreover, of those who have it, only a
   small fraction (<= 5.2%) are even susceptible to getting MS.

AB BACKGROUND: Development of animal models has been one of the most
   remarkable achievements for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) research.
   These models need to exhibit face validity, construct and predictive
   validity, as well as internal (replicability) and external validity
   (generalizability). Among these models, chronic stress induced by water
   avoidance exposure (WA) has been validated in rats through increasing
   visceral hypersensitivity, motility impairment, anxiety and, colonic
   immune activity, all related to IBS.
   OBJECTIVE: To assess the external validity of WA indirectly on colonic
   motility in Wistar rats.
   METHOD: Ten male-Wistar rats were exposed to WA and compared with ten
   Wistar rats not exposed (controls). At the end of each exposure, the
   quantity of fecal pellets were determined and considered as a sign of
   autonomic regulation of colonic motility. Data was analyzed with a
   general linear model for repeated measures.
   RESULTS: Rats exposed to WA had higher number or pellets than controls:
   7.46 ± 0.45 (95%CI: 6.51, 8.41) vs. 2.88 ± 0.45 (1.93, 3.83), p < 0.001.
   The higher number of pellets was related to WA exposure as there were no
   other significant interactions. In both groups, the number of pellets
   was higher during the first day and then decreased progressively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Chronic stress induced through WA in Wistar rats, exhibits
   external validity as an experimental model for IBS research and our
   findings of increased number of fecal pellets coincide with the
   appearance hypermotility related to IBS. The model is optimum for
   research studies on this disorder.

AB Objective: The most widely studied positron emission tomography ligand
   for in vivo P-amyloid imaging is C-11-Pittsburgh compound B (C-11-PIB).
   Its availability, however, is limited by the need for an on-site
   cyclotron. Validation of the F-18-labeled PIB derivative
   F-18-flutemetamol could significantly enhance access to this novel
   technology.
   Methods: Twenty-seven patients with early-stage clinically probable
   Alzheimer disease (AD), 20 with amnestic mild cognitive impairment
   (MCI), and 15 cognitively intact healthy volunteers (HVs) above and 10
   HVs below 55 years of age participated. The primary endpoint was the
   efficacy of blinded visual assessments of F-18-flutemetamol scans in
   assigning subjects to a raised versus normal uptake category, with
   clinical diagnosis as the standard of truth (SOT). As secondary
   objectives, we determined the correlation between the regional
   standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) for F-18-flutemetamol and its
   parent molecule C-11-PIB in 20 of the AD subjects and 20 of the MCI
   patients. We also determined test-retest variability of
   F-18-flutemetamol SUVRs in 5 of the AD subjects.
   Results: Blinded visual assessments of F-18-flutemetamol scans assigned
   25 of 27 scans from AD subjects and 1 of 15 scans from the elderly HVs
   to the raised category, corresponding to a sensitivity of 93.1% and a
   specificity of 93.3% against the SOT. Correlation coefficients between
   cortical F-18-flutemetamol SUVRs and C-11-PIB SUVRs ranged from 0.89 to
   0.92. Test-retest variabilities of regional SUVRs were 1 to 4%.
   Interpretation: F-18-Flutemetamol performs similarly to the C-11-PIB
   parent molecule within the same subjects and provides high test-retest
   replicability and potentially much wider accessibility for clinical and
   research use. ANN NEUROL 2010;68:319-329

AB Objective: Population-based demands for trauma services have accelerated
   interest in the rapid deployment of efficacious interventions to address
   the diverse mental health consequences of traumatic experiences.
   However, optimal strategies for supporting either implementation or
   dissemination of trauma-focused interventions within healthcare or
   mental healthcare systems are underdeveloped.
   Methods: This work offers suggestions for adapting treatment research
   parameters in order to advance the science on the implementable and
   practical use of trauma-focused interventions within a public health
   framework. To this end, we briefly examine the current status of
   research evidence in this area and discuss efficacy and effectiveness
   treatment research parameters with specific attention to the
   implications for developing the research base on the implementation and
   dissemination of effective trauma practices for children and
   adolescents.
   Results: Examples from current studies are used to identify approaches
   for developing, testing and enhancing strategies to roll out effective
   treatment practices in real-world settings.
   Conclusions: New approaches that reflect the contexts in which these
   practices are implemented may enhance the feasibility, acceptability,
   replicability and sustainability of trauma treatments and services, and
   thus improve outcomes for a broader population of youth and families.

AB Objective: Identifying developmental trajectories of alcohol use is
   fundamental in building theories of alcoholism etiology and course. The
   purpose of this study was to replicate and generalize our previous
   finding that had been based on a twin sample drawn from the Vietnam Era
   Twin Registry. In this study, we made use of a nontwin sample of Vietnam
   veterans drawn from the Vietnam Era Study-a 25-year follow-up of the
   Vietnam Drug User Returns project that assessed the long-term medical
   and psychiatric consequences of substance abuse or dependence in
   Vietnam. Method: Alcohol-related behaviors and psychiatric status were
   assessed in a sample of 839 individuals that comprised 323 veterans who
   tested positive for drugs (i.e., opiates, barbiturates, or amphetamines)
   on discharge from Vietnam, 319 veterans who tested negative for drugs at
   that time, and a nonveteran control sample (n = 197). Individuals with a
   lifetime diagnosis of alcohol dependence (n = 293) were selected for
   further analysis. Using detailed life history charts, in-person
   structured interviews were conducted, which entailed retrospective
   reports covering the 25 years since the 1972 survey. Measures of alcohol
   and drug use as well as psychiatric symptoms were obtained by assessing
   each year of the follow-up interval, beginning with 1972. Results: Using
   latent growth mixture modeling, a four-class model was identified with
   trajectories that were parallel to those identified in our previous
   studies based on the Vietnam Era Twin Registry: severe chronic
   alcoholics, severe nonchronic alcoholics, late-onset alcoholics, and
   young-adult alcoholics. Conclusions: Present findings provide additional
   support for the replicability and generalizability of meaningful
   differences in the course of alcoholism from early adulthood to midlife.

AB The effects of toxins at ambient concentrations on microbial activity
   and community dynamics are poorly understood. We operated 4 membrane
   bioreactors (MBRs) in parallel; two reactors were continuously exposed
   to the toxin 3-chloroaniline (3-CA) at environmentally relevant levels,
   representing 25% of the total chemical oxygen demand (COD; Total COD =
   400 mg l(-1) d(-1)), and two reactors received no 3-CA. During the 70 d
   exposure to 3-CA the microbial communities never adapted as evidenced by
   a 48% and 14% reduction in COD and ammonia removal, respectively,
   compared to over 92% reduction for both measurements in the controls.
   The bacterial 16S rRNA gene was monitored using terminal restriction
   fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis (n = 15 temporal grab
   samples per reactor) over the 70 d period. T-RFLP spectra analysis
   compared the rapid species turnover rate (STR) approach with the more
   computationally intensive non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS)
   complemented with multi-response permutation procedure (MRPP). The
   methods revealed comparable findings and the presence of 3-CA selected
   for a more convergent community with less bacterial turnover. In
   contrast, the control MBRs were more divergent as evidenced by greater
   bacterial turnover variability. The importance of studying replicate
   reactors is highlighted by the fact that one of the two controls was
   significantly different from the treatment MBRs ( p-value = 0.01, alpha
   = 0.05) whereas the other one was not (p-value = 0.24, alpha = 0.05).
   The study suggests that analysis of community dynamics with the rapid
   STR approach and with NMS/MRPP can lead to comparable results when
   targeting the 16S rRNA gene. The use of replicate bioreactors is
   essential for meaningful interpretation of microbial community patterns.

AB Epidemiological studies with human populations indicate associations
   between maternal infection during pregnancy and increased risk in
   offspring for central nervous system (CNS) disorders including
   schizophrenia, autism and cerebral palsy. Since 2000, a large number of
   studies have used rodent models of systemic prenatal infection or
   prenatal immune activation to characterize changes in brain function and
   behavior caused by the prenatal insult. This review provides a
   comprehensive summary of these findings, and examines consistencies and
   trends across studies in an effort to provide a perspective on our
   current state of understanding from this body of work. Results from
   these animal modeling studies clearly indicate that prenatal immune
   activation can cause both acute and lasting changes in behavior and CNS
   structure and function in offspring. Across laboratories, studies vary
   with respect to the type, dose and timing of immunogen administration
   during gestation, species used, postnatal age examined and specific
   outcome measure quantified. This makes comparison across studies and
   assessment of rep-licability difficult. With regard to mechanisms,
   evidence for roles for several acute mediators of effects of prenatal
   immune activation has emerged, including circulating interleukin-6,
   increased placental cytokines and oxidative stress in the fetal brain.
   However, information required to describe the complete mechanistic
   pathway responsible for acute effects of prenatal immune activation on
   fetal brain is lacking, and no studies have yet addressed the issue of
   how acute prenatal exposure to an immunogen is transduced into a
   long-term CNS change in the postnatal animal. Directions for further
   research are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We explored the use of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) of different
   strengths (1, 3, 6, and 9%) in the preparation of lake-sediment samples
   for macroscopic charcoal determination. In previous work we found that
   soaking sediment samples in 3% H(2)O(2) for 24 h disaggregates samples
   and removes or bleaches some non-charred organic material, making it
   easier to distinguish macroscopic charcoal particles from dark,
   non-charred organic matter. To determine whether this procedure alters
   charcoal particle abundances and size distributions, we tested the
   procedure on wood and grass samples containing a known number of
   laboratory-produced charcoal particles from different size classes
   (250-500, 500-1,000, and 1,000-2,000 A mu m). For both sample types, we
   found that post-treatment numbers were not statistically different from
   pre-treatment numbers. However, application of hydrogen peroxide
   solutions of 3, 6, and 9% to fossil charcoal assemblages in a sediment
   core from northwestern Costa Rica reduced charcoal concentrations
   markedly, by bleaching or removing particles that were not fully
   charred. We also tested the replicability of charcoal counts by
   conducting enumerations on multiple samples from the same stratigraphic
   depths in a core. Horizontally adjacent samples from the same core may
   vary in charcoal concentration. This finding has implications for
   establishing sample volume in macroscopic charcoal analysis.

AB We comment on several aspects of De Raad et al. (2010), who concluded
   that only three factors of personality description could be recovered
   across languages. First, small differences in the congruence
   coefficients of factors were interpreted by De Raad et al. as indicating
   large differences in factor replicability. Also, in three languages, a
   factor that corresponded closely to Honesty-Humility was instead
   identified as Agreeableness. In addition, the analyses included a
   lexical study in which one factor represented motor skills rather than a
   dimension of personality. We suggest alternatives to the use of pairwise
   congruence coefficients in evaluating factor replicability, including
   marker scale correlations and conceptual similarity ratings. Results
   based on those methods indicate substantial cross-language replicability

AB A controversy exists regarding the strength and replicability of
   relations between self-related constructs of self-esteem and narcissism
   in relation to aggression. Methodological issues have been posited to be
   responsible for these inconsistent results including an over-reliance on
   self-report measures and the use of dissimilar measures of aggression.
   In the current study, we examined the relations among Narcissistic
   personality disorder (NPD), self-esteem and aggression in two samples.
   Both self-report and interview ratings of NPD were correlated with both
   laboratory-based and self-reported aggression. Alternatively,
   self-esteem manifested primarily nonsignificant relations with
   aggression, except when controlling for the variance shared with NPD.
   The current results add to the extant literature suggesting that

   performance of alternative sources of ancillary data, including

   datasets were used in the analysis to allow for replicability The
   performance oldie techniques used to examine these sources was compared

   were used in the analysis, representing a range of different geographic
   legions Connecticut, New Mexico, Oregon, and South Carolina Ancillary
   data sources were used to estimate census block group population counts
   using census tracts as source zones, and the results were compared to
   the known block group population counts Results indicate that the
   performance of dasymetric methods varies substantially among study
   areas, and no single technique consistently outperforms all others The
   three best techniques are imperviousness with values greater than 75
   percent removed, imperviousness with values greater than 60 percent
   removed, and land cover. Total imperviousness and roads perform slightly
   worse, with nighttime lights performing the worst compared to all other

AB By treating the transcript abundance as a quantitative trait, gene
   expression can be mapped to local or distant genomic regions relative to
   the gene encoding the transcript. Local expression quantitative trait
   loci (eQTL) generally act in cis (that is, control the expression of
   only the contiguous structural gene), whereas distal eQTL act in trans.
   Distale QTL are more difficult to identify with certainty due to the
   fact that significant thresholds are very high since all regions of the
   genome must be tested, and confounding factors such as batch effects can
   produce false positives. Here, we compare findings from two large
   genetic crosses between mouse strains C3H/HeJ and C57BL/6J to evaluate
   the reliability of distal eQTL detection, including "hotspots''
   influencing the expression of multiple genes in trans. We found that
   >63% of local eQTL and >18% of distal eQTL were replicable at a
   threshold of LOD > 4.3 between crosses and 76% of local and >24% of
   distal eQTL at a threshold of LOD >6. Additionally, at LOD >4.3 four
   tissues studied (adipose, brain, liver, and muscle) exhibited >50%
   preservation of local eQTL and >17% preservation of distal eQTL. We
   observed replicated distal eQTL hotspots between the crosses on
   chromosomes 9 and 17. Finally, >69% of local eQTL and >10% of distale
   QTL were preserved in most tissues between sexes. We conclude that most
   local eQTL are highly replicable between mouse crosses, tissues, and sex
   as compared to distal eQTL, which exhibited modest replicability.

AB Concept of aging is developed to yield a relationship between life spans
   and the velocity of aging. The mathematical analysis shows that the mean
   extent of the advancement of aging throughout one's life is conserved,
   or equivalently, the product of the mean life span, T, and the mean rate
   of aging, (upsilon) over bar (A). is constant, T x (nu) over bar (A)= k.
   The result is in harmony with our experiences: it accounts for the
   unlimited replicability of tumor cells, and predicts the prolonged life
   spans of hibernating hamsters according to the equation, T congruent to
   T(chi)=01/1-chi (T(chi=0) is a constant and chi denotes the total
   fraction of hibernation periods), in accordance with the Lyman and
   co-workers experiment. Comparing the present result and the empirical
   relationship between life spans of various mammals and basal metabolic
   rates, it is suggested that the mean rate of aging is intimately
   connected with the mean basal metabolic rate. With the help of this
   information, we inquire the reason of the difference in mean life spans
   between women and men, the result showing that the relative mean life
   span of women to men is T(women)/T(men) congruent to 1.08 for various
   nations, which is close to the corresponding relative value of the basal
   metabolic rate. The present analysis suggests, however, that this
   relationship between life spans and basal metabolic rates must be
   treated with caution. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The demand for replicability of behavioral results across laboratories
   is viewed as a burden in behavior genetics. We demonstrate how it can
   become an asset offering a quantitative criterion that guides the design
   of better ways to describe behavior. Passing the high benchmark dictated
   by the replicability demand requires less stressful and less restraining
   experimental setups, less noisy data, individually customized cutoff
   points between the building blocks of movement, and less variable yet
   discriminative dynamic representations that would capture more
   faithfully the nature of the behavior, unmasking similarities and
   differences and revealing novel animal-centered measures. Here we review
   ten tools that enhance replicability without compromising
   discrimination. While we demonstrate the usefulness of these tools in
   the context of inbred mouse exploratory behavior they can readily be
   used in any study involving a high-resolution analysis of spatial
   behavior. Viewing replicability as a design concept and using the ten
   methodological improvements may prove useful in many fields not
   necessarily related to spatial behavior. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

   significantly different-even though these combined effect sizes consist
   of arbitrary and meaningless composites. At best, their study provides a
   recipe for conducting a replicable extrasensory perception experiment.
   This recipe includes following a design that employs the standard
   ganzfeld psi methodology and uses "selected" subjects. An experiment,
   having adequate power and that meets these criteria, has already been
   conducted and failed to produce evidence for psi. Parapsychology will
   achieve scientific acceptability only when it provides a positive theory
   with evidence based on independently replicable evidence. This is
   something it has yet to achieve after more than a century of trying.

AB Mismatch negativity (MMN) is measured by subtracting the averaged
   response to a set of standard stimuli from the averaged response to
   rarer deviant stimuli, and taking the amplitude of this difference wave
   in a given time window. This method is problematic when used to evaluate
   individuals, because there is no estimate of variance. We describe a new
   approach, in which independent components with high trial-by-trial
   variance are first removed. Next, each deviant response has the
   preceding standard response subtracted, giving a set of single trial
   difference waves. We illustrate this approach in analysis of MMN to
   brief tones in 17 adults. The best criterion for MMN combined t-test
   with an index of inter-trial coherence, giving significant MMN in 14
   (82%) of individuals. Single-trial methods can indicate which people
   show MMN. However, in some clinically normal individuals there was no
   MMN, despite good behavioral discrimination of stimuli.

AB Lecoutre, Lecoutre, and Poitevineau (2010) have provided sophisticated
   grounding for p(rep). Computing it precisely appears. fortunately, no
   more difficult than doing so approximately. Their analysis will help
   move predictive inference into the mainstream. Iverson, Wagenmakers, and
   Lee (2010) have also validated p(rep) as a boundary condition in a
   model-averaging approach. I argue that the boundary is good; that the
   proper place for their assignment of subjective priors is to update
   personal belief; and that such assignment has no place in the evaluation
   of evidence, on which priors should be flat. Maraun and Gabriel (2010)
   have provided clarification, context, and critique of the derivation of
   p(rep). They concluded that prediction can never be precise without
   knowledge of population parameters and joint empirical distributions;
   that nature evolves; that a large initial effect will encourage
   replication attempts, which are therefore not independent of it; and
   that there is no substitute for a sustained program of replication
   attempts-all of which are prudent cautions. If statistics is to be the
   handmaiden of science and policy, however, rather than history, it
   ineluctably must speak to the future. The posterior predictive
   distribution is an underexploited tool in the analyst's kit that will
   serve that end, and p(rep) is but one valid implementation of it.

AB The sense that replicability is an important aspect of empirical science
   led Killeen (2005a) to define p(rep), the probability that a replication
   will result in an outcome in the same direction as that found in a
   current experiment. Since then, several authors have praised and
   criticized p(rep), culminating in the 3 articles in the current issue of
   Psychological Methods. In this article, Killeen's p(rep) is reviewed,
   and the contributions of the current articles are summarized and
   discussed. An examination of the role of a measure of theoretical
   support such as p(rep) in the acquisition of knowledge leads me to
   concur with Senn (2002) that p(rep) is of little epistemological value.

AB This paper explores the lived experiences and aspirational social
   constructions of call centre work and employment in India's high profile
   IT Enabled Services-Business Process Outsourcing (ITES-BPO) industry;
   the ways in which they differ from those previously documented amongst
   call centre workers in the Global North (specifically the UK); and the
   consequences of that geographical reconfiguration of offshored call
   centre work for the replicability in India of workplace collective
   bargaining strategies successfully developed in some UK call centres.
   These issues are analysed using new empirical evidence from a regional
   survey of 511 non-unionised ITES-BPO workers and 42 in-depth interviews
   in India's National Capital Region. Based on this analysis, the paper
   then discusses the operation, outcomes and ongoing challenges faced by
   the newly formed 'Union for ITES Professionals' (UNITES Pro) in
   developing an alternative occupational organising model better suited to
   the particular needs, motivations and preferences of India's young,
   mobile, call centre workers. The empirical analysis presented in the
   paper is located, therefore, within wider debates on the role of
   geographical context in shaping possibilities for organising
   white-collar service workers at different ends of global service chains
   in the new economy. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives. Translate, culturally adapt, and validate a new Spanish
   version of the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP) for older persons in
   Mexico City, Mexico.
   Methods. A validation study of the new version of OHIP-Mx-49 was carried
   out through interviews and clinical examinations of people aged 60 or
   older in the southern area of Mexico City. The following variables were
   analyzed: sociodemographic (age, sex, marital status, level of
   schooling, and whether the subject lived alone), clinical (current
   number of teeth, coronal and root caries, dental hygiene, and the use of
   removable prostheses and dentures), and self-perception (of the need for
   dental and general health care). The OHIP-Mx-49 value was calculated as
   the sum of the scores in seven dimensions: functional limitation, pain,
   psychological discomfort, physical disability, psychological disability,
   social disability, and handicap. The internal consistency (Cronbach's
   alpha coefficient), replicability (intraclass correlation coefficient),
   and convergent and discriminant validity (Mann-Whitney and
   Kruskal-Wallis tests) were assessed.
   Results. Of the 131 people interviewed (average age: 73.8 +/- 8.3
   years), 77.9% were women. High internal consistency values were obtained
   for the OHIP-Mx-49 (0.96) and the dimensions (0.79-0.86), and
   replicability in the instrument (0.877) and all the dimensions except
   social disability (0.176). The average OHIP-Mx-49 score was 37.1 +/-
   35.3; higher scores were observed in people with 1-9 teeth (P = 0.02),
   people who did not have coronal caries (P = 0.02), and people who
   perceived a need for dental care (P = 0.01).
   Conclusions. The OHIP-Mx-49 is a reliable and valid instrument that can
   be used with older Mexicans.

   from 774 adolescents ages 11-16 years who participated in a three-wave
   (i.e., 2005, 2006, and 2007) longitudinal study. Structural equation
   modelling analyses in Mplus demonstrated that, controlling for earlier
   levels of self-esteem, self-reported peer victimization was associated
   with lower self-esteem across one-year time intervals. Vice versa,
   however, low self-esteem was not predictive of subsequent self-reported
   victimization. Evidence was also found for a moderator effect of
   personality type on the longitudinal associations between self-esteem
   and victimization. Only in the subgroup of overcontrolling adolescents
   was lower self-esteem related to subsequently higher levels of peer
   victimization; their undercontrolling and ego-resilient peers were
   unaffected.

AB As qualitative inquiry has gained wider acceptance in genetic counseling
   research, it has become increasingly important for researchers and those
   who evaluate their work to recognize the diversity of methods that fall
   under this broad umbrella. Some of these methods adhere to the
   traditional conventions of scientific research (e.g., objectivity,
   reliability, validity, replicability, causality and generalizability).
   When such studies are evaluated by reviewers who are well versed in
   scientific methods, the rigor of the study may be readily apparent.
   However, when researchers are using methods that do not conform to
   traditional scientific conventions, the distinction between well
   conducted and poorly conducted studies may become more difficult to
   discern. This article focuses on grounded theory because it is a widely
   used qualitative method. We highlight key components of this method in
   order to contrast conventions that fall within a scientific paradigm to
   those that fall within an interpretivist paradigm. The intent is to
   illustrate how the conventions within these two different paradigms
   yield different types of knowledge claims-both of which can advance
   genetic counseling theory and practice.

   statistic prep overestimates the "true probability of replication." We
   show that Iverson et al. confused the probability of replication of an
   observed direction of effect with a probability of coincidence the
   probability that two future experiments will return the same sign. The
   theoretical analysis is punctuated with a simulation of the predictions
   of prep for a realistic random effects world of representative
   parameters, when those are unknown a priori. We emphasize throughout
   that prep is intended to evaluate the probability of a replication
   outcome after observations, not to estimate a parameter Hence, the usual
   conventional criteria (unbiasedness, minimum variance estimator) for
   judging estimators are not appropriate for probabilities such asp and

   the number of interactions found among species and also whether there
   had been changes in the network structure associated with appearance of
   new ant and plant species during. that 10-year period. Our results show
   that the nested topology of the network was similar between sampling
   dates, group dissimilarity increased, mean number of interactions for
   ant species increased, the frequency distribution of standardized
   degrees reached higher values for plant species, more ant species and
   fewer plant species constituted the core of the more recent network, and
   the presence of new ant and plant species increased while their
   contribution to nestedness remained the same. Generalist species (i.e.,
   those with the most links or interactions) appeared to maintain the
   stability of the network because the new species incorporated into the
   communities were linked to this core of generalists. Camponotus planatus
   was the most extreme generalist ant species (the one with the most
   links) in both networks, followed by four other ant species; but other
   species changed either their position along the continuum of generalists
   relative to specialists or their presence or absence within the network.
   Even though new species moved into the area during the decade between
   the surveys, the overall network structure remained unmodified.

AB Objectives. The purpose of this study is to determine the factors
   influencing the spatial precision and the replicability of
   electromagnetic trackers (EMT) for the localization of electrodes and
   natural landmarks on the patient's head.
   Materials and methods. The effects of seven conditions on the
   measurement of the EMT were investigated with a Polhemus Fastrack:
   distance, contact between two components of the EMT, presence of
   magnetic object, localization of landmarks and electrodes on a phantom
   and a human subject without and with movements.
   Results. The EMT has a precision of 0.15 mm +/- 0.36 mm for the
   measurements made on still objects in a non-magnetic environment. On a
   human subject, the mean variation of the nasion position is 1.6 mm +/-
   1.46 mm and 2.7 mm +/- 1.40 mm for the tragus. The increase of the
   electrode measurement dispersions is significant between the phantom and
   the human subject with a mean variation of 2.39 mm +/- 1.26 mm. In
   certain conditions, up to 15% of the measurements may be considered as
   outliers.
   Conclusion. The precision significantly decreases for this application
   in the following cases: (1) physical contacts between the
   stylus/transmitter/receiver cables, (2) presence of magnetic objects in
   the surrounding of the EMT system, (3) skin and hair softness and (4)
   subject's head movements. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

   association between the quality of the parent-adolescent relationship on
   the one hand, and aggression and delinquency on the other hand, are the
   same for boys and girls of Dutch and Moroccan origin living in the
   Netherlands. Since inconsistent results have been found previously, the
   present study tests the replicability of the model of associations in
   two different Dutch samples of adolescents.
   Study 1 included 288 adolescents (M age = 14.9, range 12-17 years) all
   attending lower secondary education. Study 2 included 306 adolescents (M
   age = 13.2, range = 12-15 years) who were part of a larger community
   sample with oversampling of at risk adolescents.
   Multigroup structural analyses showed that neither in Study 1 nor in
   Study 2 ethnic or gender differences were found in the patterns of
   associations between support, autonomy, disclosure, and negativity in
   the parent-adolescent relationship and aggression and delinquency. The
   patterns were largely similar for both studies. Mainly negative quality
   of the relationship in both studies was found to be strongly related to
   both aggression and delinquency.
   Results show that family processes that affect adolescent development,
   show a large degree of universality across gender and ethnicity.

AB This work presents the results of an interlaboratory proficiency
   exercise for whole-sediment toxicity assays with the benthic marine
   diatom Cylindrotheca closterium. An assay protocol was established and
   followed by all participating laboratories. Cell growth after 72 h
   exposure was the endpoint used. Four sediment samples of unknown
   toxicity were assayed. The main problem encountered during this exercise
   was the differences in the cell growth of algae exposed to reference
   sediment. Those differences may be associated with changes in the
   physiological status of the initial culture due to temperature changes
   during transport to the other laboratories. In general, the method
   proposed presented good replicability (precision between replicates) and
   reproducibility (interlaboratory precision). Around 80% (17 out of 21)
   of results obtained were classified as satisfactory (Z-scores <2). The
   whole-sediment assay with C closterium presented here can be considered
   sufficiently successful for possible use as a standard toxicity test.
   The assay is simple to perform, the proposed species is ecologically
   relevant as an integral component of microphytobenthos, and is widely
   distributed around the world. These positive factors suggest that the
   whole-sediment assay with the benthic marine diatom C. closterium can be
   used as a reliable tool in marine sediment quality assessment. (C) 2009

   NOVELTY - The method involves receiving, by a client device (410), a
   platform-independent data superstructure defining the appearance and
   behavior of an application (406), and receiving an application event
   generated by execution of an instantiated application and representative
   of an update to the application state of the application. Information in
   a segment of the platform-independent data superstructure associated
   with the application event is updated, and the application state is
   updated in the device in accordance with the superstructure segment
   update.
   USE - Method for creating and managing a platform-independent
   application in a client device. Uses include but are not limited to a
   cell phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a laptop computer, and a
   desktop computer.
   ADVANTAGE - The method allows a defined portion of the application to be
   addressed and updated in response to application events without
   necessitating update of the entire application, and allows the
   appearance and behavior of the application to be propagated with
   consistency across heterogeneous device types, to enable cross-device
   interoperability, replicability, and compatibility of applications and
   data with a consistency of user experience.

   Small-Scale Aquaculture (SSA) to Sustainable Rural Development (SRD),
   held from 6 to 8 August 2009, in Tagaytay City, the Philippines, and
   participated by a total of twenty-three experts, was convened to achieve
   the following: (i) present the outcomes (results and analysis) of the
   case studies which pilot-tested the Nha Trang SSA contribution
   indicators using various types of SSA in the Philippines, Thailand and
   Viet Nam; (ii) present the cross-country analysis and synthesis based on
   the outcomes of the pilot tests; (iii) refine and validate the
   indicators and evaluate their robustness, replicability and
   applicability in helping measure SSA sector performance for wider
   adoption and (iv) draw up a list of recommendations to further support
   (e.g. appropriate interventions, priority setting and resource
   allocation) to the SSA sub-sector of sustainable aquaculture and rural
   development programmes based on a broad understanding of sector
   performance (as measured by indicators) as well as risks and threats.
   The expert workshop carefully looked at each of the 14 Nha Trang SSA
   indicators and its applicability to the wide spectrum of SSA systems,
   based on the outcomes of the three country pilot tests covering seven
   SSA types, and the cross-country analysis/regional synthesis. The expert
   workshop brought forward a number of issues/concerns with respect to
   methodology, direct attribution to SRD, source of data and constraints
   in data collection. Recommendations were provided on which of the 14 Nha
   Trang indicators need further refining, merging, and/or deleting from
   the list, additional indicators as well as some aspects of the
   methodology used. A number of general recommendations was drawn for
   follow-up work in terms of SSA systems and scaling up, special research
   topics/studies including a number of issues of wider concern, e.g.,
   biosecurity and food safety, natural disasters and risks, statistical
   considerations, indicators for assessing impacts of SSA to the
   environment and biodiversity and networking.

AB We studied the degree of repeatability of auditory and somatosensory
   evoked fields (AEF and SEF). A single subject was studied repeatedly
   with a 306-channel Elekta Neuromag (R) system over a period of six
   years. In 21 recordings the subject kept his head as immobile as
   possible. Averaged AEF and SEF data were analyzed with equivalent
   current dipoles (ECDs). The mean 3D variations of the dipole
   localizations were 5.6 mm for SEF, 6.7 mm for ipsilateral AEF, and 5.9
   mm for contralateral AEF.
   In addition, 17 recordings were performed with the subject moving his
   head continuously. In some of these recordings, additional interference
   was introduced by leaving the door of the magnetically shielded room
   open or by attaching magnetized pieces on the scalp. The ECDs obtained
   from the corresponding static head position served as the reference.
   After applying spatiotemporal signal space separation (tSSS) and head
   movement compensation (MC), the mean ECD localization differences to the
   reference localizations were 3.5 +/- 2.6 mm for SEF, 4.0 +/- 1.5 mm for
   ipsilateral AEF, and 4.0 +/- 2.0 mm for contralateral AEF.
   The combined tSSS and MC processing compensated effectively for the
   disturbances caused by head motion and additional interference sources.
   All ECD parameters were similar to the reference results for SEFs, but
   AEF dipole amplitudes decreased by 30% during head movement.
   Importantly, the dipole localization differences after tSSS and MC
   processing of data with motion and additional interference are smaller
   than the localization variability in the reference recordings.

AB Identification of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) of roots plays an
   important role in the genetic mechanism study of root system. A number
   of QTLs for root traits have been detected using different populations
   in rice ( Oryza sativa L.), but rarely in wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.).
   The "immortalized F 2" population is favorable for QTL analysis due to
   its similar proportions of genotypes in the population, and the
   replicability at multiple locations over several years. The objective of
   this study was to detect QTLs for several root traits at seedling stage
   in wheat. From a set of doubled haploid lines derived from Huapei 3 *
   Yumai 57, an "immortalized F 2" population was constructed with 168
   single crosses. Wheat seedlings were hydroponically cultured with
   Hoagland's solution in a light incubator, and sampled when the fifth
   leaf emerged. Nine root traits including root total length, root surface
   area, root average diameter, root volume, root tips, maximum root
   length, shoot dry weight, root dry weight, and ratio of root dry weight
   to shoot dry weight per plant were measured using the WinRHIZO Root
   Analysis System. QTLs associated with the nine traits were detected
   using composite interval mapping (CIM) method. A total of seven additive
   QTLs and 12 pairs of epistatic QTLs were mapped on chromosomes 1A, 1D,
   2A, 2B, 2D, 3A, 3B, 5D, 6D, and 7D. Additive, dominant and epistatic
   effects were observed across these QTLs, including the interactions
   between additive and additive, additive and dominance, dominance and
   additive, as well as dominance and dominance. The phenotypic variation
   explained by each QTL ranged from 0.01% to 11.91%. In the interval
   between  XWMC41 and  XBARC349.2 on chromosome 2D, a QTL for total root
   length and root dry weight was detected. Epistasis was of great
   importance in root growth and development at seedling stage in wheat.
   The results showed a complex mechanism on the genetics of root traits in
   wheat, and the eight root traits were significantly correlated with each
   other. In marker-assisted breeding practice, several root traits should
   be considered simultaneously for an integrated performance of roots with
   proper size and shape.

AB The devastating consequences of desertification and water scarcity can
   be seen and felt all over the world. About 3.6 billion of the world's
   5.2 billion hectares of dryland used for agriculture have suffered
   erosion, soil degradation and salination. Desertification can also have
   a serious impact far beyond the borders of directly affected countries,
   can hinder efforts for sustainable development and introduces new
   threats to human health, ecosystems and national economies. Forced
   migration and potential for inter-state conflict add to the urgency of
   this global problem. Therefore, solutions are desperately needed, such
   as the improvement of drought and salinity tolerance of crops. A more
   recent idea is to take advantage of the genetic potential of crops still
   have (Glenn et al., 1998). This idea requires to first identify
   accessions of a crop species showing enhanced drought and/or salt
   tolerance. Another promising approach under discussion is to use (xero-)
   halophytes instead of glycophytic crops or to transfer genes from
   halophytes to regular crops to enhance their salt resistance. Halophytes
   grow in a wide variety of saline habitats, from coastal regions, salt
   marshes and mudflats to inland deserts, salt flats and steppes (El
   Shaer, 2003). Halophytes are introduced already at many sites to
   valorize highly salinized zones and non-conventional water resources
   such as waste water. However, the sustainable use of these plants
   depends under osmotic and ionic stress on the ability to exhibit a wide
   range of responses at molecular, cellular and whole plant levels. This
   includes the synthesis of compatibles solutes/ osmolytes, specific
   proteins and radical scavenging mechanisms, ion uptake and
   compartmentation of injurious ions. Acclimation of these plants to
   salinity depends also upon activation of cascades of molecular networks
   involved to stress sensing, signal transduction and the expression of
   specific stress-related gene and metabolites. The product of these genes
   may participate in the generation of regulatory molecules such as plant
   hormones. The deeper understanding and replicability of the
   physiological and biochemical basis of drought and salt resistance can
   provide a basis for the cultivation of suitable plants in regions
   threatened by desertification and water scarcity sustainable culture
   conditions. Even the drylands could offer tangible economic and
   ecological opportunities. The aim of this chapter is to screen the
   responses of halophytes with regard to drought and salt resistance to
   identify early indicators allowing successful breeding (Koyro et al.,
   2009).

   differ across Central and Eastern European (CEE) economies
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses data from the World Bank
   Group's World Business Environment Survey (WBES) compare entrepreneurial
   firms perceptions of changes in different components of regulative
   institutions in Latin and orthodox CEE economies The data used in this
   paper capture a decade's progress in the development of regulative
   institutions in these economies
   Findings - It was found that the state s regulatory participatory, and
   supportive roles are more favorable to businesses in the Latin countries
   than in the orthodox countries The findings provide support for the
   notion that informal institutions influence the degree of
   generalizeability and replicability of Western political and economic
   institutions' success in driving firms' entrepreneurial behavior in
   emerging economies
   Research limitations/implications - The first limitation is that the
   data used were collected about a decade ago Another limitation relates
   to a lack of coverage of many former Soviet republics and some other CEE
   countries in the WBES
   Practical implications - The findings point to the need of strategic
   planning and various degrees of adaptation of business strategies across
   the CEE economies Second businesses may differ in terms of the relative
   importance of regulatory, participatory and supportive roles of the
   government in their operations Finally some CEE economies can be
   influenced more than others by international pressures
   Originality/value - This paper's greatest value stems from the fact that
   it uses internationally comparable firm level data to empirically
   examine entrepreneurial firms' perceptions of regulative institutions m

EP (28 October 2010)
PD 2010
PY 2010
AB Background: MS-pathogenesis is known to involve both multiple
   environmental events, and several independent genetic risk-factors.
   Methods: A model of susceptibility is developed and a mathematical
   analysis undertaken to elucidate the nature of genetic susceptibility to
   MS and to understand the constraints that are placed on the genetic
   basis of MS, both by the known epidemiological facts of this disease and
   by the known frequency of the HLA DRB1*1501 allele in the general
   populations of northern Europe and North America. Results: For the large
   majority of cases (possibly all), MS develops, in part, because an
   individual is genetically susceptible. Nevertheless, 2.2% or less of the
   general population is genetically susceptible. Moreover, from the model,
   the number of susceptibility-loci that need to be in a "susceptible
   allelic state" to produce MS-susceptibility is small (11-18), whereas
   the total number of such susceptibility-loci is large (50-200), and
   their "frequency of susceptibility" is low (i.e., ≤0.12). The optimal
   solution to the model equations (which occurs when 80% of the loci are
   recessive) predicts the epidemiological data quite closely. Conclusions:
   The model suggests that combinations of only a small number of genetic
   loci in a "susceptible allelic state" produce MS-susceptibility.
   Nevertheless, genome-wide associations studies with hundreds of
   thousands of SNPs, are plagued by both false-positive and false-negative
   identifications and, consequently, emphasis has been rightly placed on
   the replicability of findings. Nevertheless, because genome-wide screens
   don't distinguish between true susceptibility-loci and
   disease-modifying-loci, and because only true susceptibility-loci are
   constrained by the model, unraveling the two will not be possible using
   this approach. The model also suggests that HLA DRB1 may not be as
   uniquely important for MS-susceptibility as currently believed. Thus,
   this allele is only one among a hundred or more loci involved in MS
   susceptibility. Even though the "frequency of susceptibility" at the HLA
   DRB1 locus is four-fold that of other loci, the penetrance of those

AB UNLABELLED: HEALTH CARE POLICY BACKGROUND: Findings from scientific
   studies form the basis for evidence-based health policy decisions.
   SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND: Quality assessments to evaluate the credibility
   of study results are an essential part of health technology assessment
   reports and systematic reviews. Quality assessment tools (QAT) for
   assessing the study quality examine to what extent study results are
   systematically distorted by confounding or bias (internal validity). The
   tools can be divided into checklists, scales and component ratings.
   RESEARCH QUESTIONS: What QAT are available to assess the quality of
   interventional studies or studies in the field of health economics, how
   do they differ from each other and what conclusions can be drawn from
   these results for quality assessments?
   METHODS: A systematic search of relevant databases from 1988 onwards is
   done, supplemented by screening of the references, of the HTA reports of
   the German Agency for Health Technology Assessment (DAHTA) and an
   internet search. The selection of relevant literature, the data
   extraction and the quality assessment are carried out by two independent
   reviewers. The substantive elements of the QAT are extracted using a
   modified criteria list consisting of items and domains specific to
   randomized trials, observational studies, diagnostic studies, systematic
   reviews and health economic studies. Based on the number of covered
   items and domains, more and less comprehensive QAT are distinguished. In
   order to exchange experiences regarding problems in the practical
   application of tools, a workshop is hosted.
   RESULTS: A total of eight systematic methodological reviews is
   identified as well as 147 QAT: 15 for systematic reviews, 80 for
   randomized trials, 30 for observational studies, 17 for diagnostic
   studies and 22 for health economic studies. The tools vary considerably
   with regard to the content, the performance and quality of
   operationalisation. Some tools do not only include the items of internal
   validity but also the items of quality of reporting and external
   validity. No tool covers all elements or domains. Design-specific
   generic tools are presented, which cover most of the content criteria.
   DISCUSSION: The evaluation of QAT by using content criteria is
   difficult, because there is no scientific consensus on the necessary
   elements of internal validity, and not all of the generally accepted
   elements are based on empirical evidence. Comparing QAT with regard to
   contents neglects the operationalisation of the respective parameters,
   for which the quality and precision are important for transparency,
   replicability, the correct assessment and interrater reliability. QAT,
   which mix items on the quality of reporting and internal validity,
   should be avoided.
   CONCLUSIONS: There are different, design-specific tools available which
   can be preferred for quality assessment, because of its wider coverage
   of substantive elements of internal validity. To minimise the
   subjectivity of the assessment, tools with a detailed and precise
   operationalisation of the individual elements should be applied. For
   health economic studies, tools should be developed and complemented with
   instructions, which define the appropriateness of the criteria. Further
   research is needed to identify study characteristics that influence the
   internal validity of studies.

AB Background/Aims: Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRHa) are
   the accepted treatment of idiopathic central precocious puberty. As it
   has been found that growth velocity may be decreased with GnRHa
   treatment, clinical trials with GnRHa combined with growth hormone (GH)
   have been carried out. In a recent study 46 adopted girls with early or
   precocious puberty were randomly assigned to treatment with either GnRHa
   or GnRHa combined with GH, and followed to final height (FH). It was
   found that FH was significantly higher in the combined treatment group,
   158.9 compared with 155.8 cm in the GnRHa treated group. In order to
   select the patients who could benefit from added GH, predictions of FH
   at the start of treatment according to the methods of bone age
   determination of Greulich-Pyle (GP) and Tanner-Whitehouse 2 (TW2) were
   compared. It was found that the GP method was the most useful method for
   patient selection. Recently, a revision of the Tanner-Whitehouse method,
   named Tanner-Whitehouse 3 (TW3), has been developed. The present study
   examined the useful-ness of the TW3 method in selecting suitable
   patients for combined treatment. Method: The TW3 method bone age
   determinations of the 46 girls were compared to the GP and TW2 method
   determinations, using the differences between actual FH and predicted
   adult height (PAH). Beside accuracy of prediction of FH, the criteria of
   efficiency of selection and replicability were applied in the
   comparison. Results: We found that the GP method, also when compared to
   the TW3 method, gave the most accurate prediction of the FH on only
   GnRHa treatment. This gives the best ground for selection of patients
   who can benefit from combined treatment. The GP method was also the most
   efficient in selecting patients, i.e., it could select the least number
   of patients that needed the combined treatment. The only drawback of the
   GP method was that it requires an experienced pediatric radiologist.
   Automated methods are being developed and may soon facilitate the use of
   the GP method for those less experienced. The FH after combined
   treatment could be predicted with an equation including PAH GP as well
   as PAH TW3 as variables. Conclusion: The GP method remains the most
   useful method for selection of those patients who will benefit most from
   the addition of GH to GnRHa in the treatment of idiopathic central
   precocious or early puberty. FH prediction after combined treatment
   requires PAH GP as well as PAH TW3. Copyright (C) 2010 S. Karger AG,

AB In Decision XV/12, the Parties to the Montreal Protocol recognize the
   risk of potential non-compliance vis a vis the agreed phase-out schedule
   for those A5 countries that rely on the use of Methyl Bromide (MB) to
   stabilize and disinfest high moisture dates at time of harvest. Indeed,
   up to now, the Methyl Bromide Technical Option Committee of TEAP has not
   been able to identify feasible alternatives to replace the use of this
   fumigant in the specific sector of high-moisture dates (see 2006 MBTOC
   Assessment report, 2008 TEAP progress report).
   UNIDO took the initiative to respond to Decision XV/12 and a project
   proposal was designed to demonstrate the feasibility of alternatives to
   MB for the post-harvest treatment of high moisture dates. The objective
   of the project is to demonstrate whether alternatives to MB for the
   treatment of high moisture dates are technically and economically
   available in Algeria and Tunisia as well as in similar conditions and
   circumstances.
   A preliminary investigation of potential pest control techniques was
   launched. Five alternatives were tested in 2008 in a small-scale
   laboratory test in France, using 'Deglet Nour' from Biskra, Algeria.
   The tests have been conducted with limited replicability and with
   limited control on efficacy and effect on fruit quality. Furthermore,
   the environmental conditions were different from the conditions that
   might be expected in north African countries at the time of treatment.
   Despite the fact that the test provided interesting technical
   information, it should be considered of limited scientific value.
   UNIDO presented the results of that preliminary investigation holding a
   technical workshop on the replacement of methyl bromide for the
   disinfestation of high moisture dates in Vienna (16-17 April 2009).
   For the time being, two alternatives have been considered promising for
   the full scale tests: phosphine without ammonia and high temperatures.
   The full scale demonstration will be designed to assess the efficacy of
   the two alternatives on all the live stages of pests (in particular on
   eggs of Lepidoptera) and to assess the effect on fruit quality.
   Experience has shown that full involvement of local experts and
   expertise is needed for the successful preparation, design and
   implementation of the activities.

AB We tested the hypothesis that only 3 factors of personality description
   are replicable across many different languages if they are independently
   derived by a psycholexical approach. Our test was based on 14 trait
   taxonomies from 12 different languages. Factors were compared at each
   level of factor extraction with solutions with I to 6 factors. The 294
   factors in the comparisons were identified using sets of markers of the
   6-factor model by correlating the marker scales with the factors. The
   factor structures were pairwise compared in each case on the basis of
   the common variables that define the 2 sets of factors. Congruence
   coefficients were calculated between the varimax rotated structures
   after Procrustes rotation, where each structure in turn served as a
   target to which all other structures were rotated. On the basis of
   average congruence coefficients of all 91 comparisons, we conclude that
   factor solutions with 3 factors on average are replicable across
   languages; solutions with more factors are not.

AB A previous Monte Carlo study examined the relative powers of several
   simple and more complex procedures for testing the significance of
   difference in mean rates of change in a controlled, longitudinal,
   treatment evaluation study. Results revealed that the relative powers
   depended on the correlation structure of the simulated repeated
   measurements. Tests on dropout-weighted linear slope coefficients fitted
   to all of the available measurements for each participant were found to
   provide superior power in the presence of compound symmetry (CS), but
   tests of significance applied to simple baseline-to-endpoint difference
   scores provided superior power in the presence of a strongly
   autoregressive (AR) correlation structure. Type I error rates appeared
   in an acceptable range for both of those analyses. Insofar as the
   previous study considered only two widely disparate correlation
   structures, the present work was undertaken to examine where along a
   continuum of correlation structures lying between strongly AR and CS the
   power balance shifts from favoring the simple endpoint difference-score
   analysis to favoring a regression analysis that utilizes all of the
   available repeated measurements for each participant. With power
   calculated from the relative frequencies of rejecting Ho at different
   levels of autoregression, the results indicate superior power for the
   simple endpoint analysis across more than half the distance from
   strongly AR to CS. To examine replicability of the simulation results
   using real data from a previously published study, sampling with
   replacement from a double-blind controlled study examining the treatment
   of depression was used to create a Monte Carlo data set from which power
   could be calculated from relative frequencies of rejecting Ho.

   data sources, mainly from free software repositories, but that the
   amount of publicly available processed datasets is very low. Regarding
   tools and scripts, for a majority of papers we have not been able to
   find any tool, even for papers where the authors explicitly state that

   by means of clustering methods. They were described as a resilient (low
   N, high E), a non-desirable (high N, low E, A, and C), and a reserved
   overcontrolled prototype (low E and 0, high A and C). The prototypes
   were related to the level of aggressiveness, assessed by the Buss-Perry

AB Brain-imaging studies suggest that antisocial and violent behavior is
   associated with structural and functional deficits in the prefrontal
   cortex, but there is heterogeneity in findings and it is unclear whether
   findings apply to psychopaths, non-violent offenders, community-based
   samples, and studies employing psychiatric controls. A meta-analysis was
   conducted on 43 structural and functional imaging studies, and the
   results show significantly reduced prefrontal structure and function in
   antisocial individuals. Effect sizes were significant for both
   structural and functional studies. With minor exceptions, no
   statistically significant moderating effects of sample characteristics
   and methodological variables were observed. Findings were localized to
   the right orbitofrontal cortex, right anterior cingulate cortex, and
   left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Findings confirm the replicability
   of prefrontal structural and functional impairments in antisocial
   populations and highlight the involvement of orbitofrontal. dorsolateral
   frontal, and anterior cingulate cortex in antisocial behavior. (C) 2009

AB The purpose of the current paper is to examine the ways in which age and

   breaches. We first introduce the concepts of contract malleability (the
   degree to which individuals can tolerate deviations from contract
   expectations) and contract replicability (the degree to which
   individuals believe that their psychological contracts can be replicated
   elsewhere). Next, we discuss the variety of reasons why contract
   malleability and replicability become greater with age and work
   experience and how contract malleability and replicability may temper
   negative reactions to psychological contract breaches. We also address
   the different ways contract malleability and replicability mediate the
   relationships between age and work experience, on one hand, and exit,
   voice, loyalty, and neglect behaviors on the other. We consider the
   moderating effects of age similarity and dissimilarity here as well. The
   paper concludes with a discussion of the implications for future
   research designs and for managing older and more experienced workers.

AB Purpose: The current study seeks to understand which journals have been
   recently cited by scholars publishing in the field of educational
   leadership (i.e., specifically publishing in Educational Administration
   Quarterly [EAQ] and Journal of School Leadership [JSL]). Method: The
   researchers recorded the name and number of occurrences of journals that
   appeared in the bibliographies of articles published in EAQ and JSL from
   2000 to 2007. The total counts for EAQ and JSL were combined to reach a
   final count. All journals then were rank ordered according to frequency.
   Findings: Five main findings were noted in the current study. First, it
   was found that authors who contribute to these journals tend to
   reference a different set of periodicals compared to those that
   professors of educational leadership say they actually read. Second, two
   of the leading journals (EAQ and JSL) in the field of educational
   leadership may be reaching unique audiences. Third, of the top 25 cited
   journals, slightly more than one third of the articles cited in EAQ and
   JSL from 2000 to 2007 were published in those two journals. Fourth, 4 of
   the top 15 most cited journals are practitioner journals. Finally, the
   findings show where educational leadership authors should publish to get
   their work noticed by top scholars in the field. Conclusion: The current
   study adds a valuable factor influencing authors' choices of journals in
   which to publish their work: a journal's citation frequency. The
   citation patterns noted in the current article will help authors
   consider issues of spread and replicability when seeking suitable
   outlets to publish their scholarly work.

AB Objectives We employed the placebo-caffeine paradigm to test whether the
   presence or absence of a substance (caffeine) influences the placebo
   effect. Methods: In experiment 1 consisting of four conditions with n =
   15 participants each (control, placebo, two double-blind groups, each
   with placebo only), we maximized the placebo effect through expectation.
   Effects were assessed with physiological (blood pressure, heart rate),
   psychomotor (response times), and well-being indicators (self-report).
   In experiment 2, caffeine was administered in one of the double-blind
   groups, and another condition was added where caffeine was given openly.
   Results Effect sizes were medium to large for some outcome parameters in
   experiment 1 and 2, showing partial replicability of the classical
   placebo effect. Although not formally significant, differences between
   the double blind placebo conditions of the two experiments (with and
   without caffeine present) were medium to small. There was a significant
   difference (p = 0.03) between experiment I and experiment 2 in the
   physiological variables, and a near significant interaction effect
   between groups and experiments in the physiological variables (p =
   0.06).
   Conclusion The question warrants further scrutiny. The presence of a
   pharmacological substance might change the magnitude of the placebo
   response. Copyright (c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

PD OCT 2009
PY 2009
AB BACKGROUND
   Between 2000 and 2006 the Vanderbilt, Northwestern, Texas and
   Harvard/MIT Engineering Research Center (VaNTH/ERC) developed, tested,
   and implemented a set of educational innovations based largely on the
   ideas presented in the book How People Learn (HPL) and an instructional
   design known as the the STAR Legacy Cycle. The motivation for this study
   was to synthesize the results of this work. Published and unpublished
   experimental and quasi-experimental assessments were included in this
   synthesis.
   PURPOSE (HYPOTHESIS)
   The fundamental hypotheses tested were whether a set of modules
   involving challenge-based instruction and other course innovations,
   often involving advanced computer-based technologies, improved student
   performance in a variety of educational settings and student
   populations, and whether improvements could be achieved by instructors
   other than the developers of the innovations.
   DESIGN/METHOD
   Meta-analysis of effects from thirty-three separate modules in five
   courses in bioengineering domains was undertaken, along with three case
   studies.
   RESULTS
   Results from the experimental (randomized) and stronger-quasi
   experimental studies revealed a weighted effect size of 0.655 (p <
   0.001). Studies using randomized designs produced smaller effects, and
   studies using measures of transfer and adaptive expertise to index
   outcomes produced larger effects. Analyses also revealed that the
   results can be replicated by instructors other than the developers of
   the modules, in a variety of student populations and educational
   settings, and at other institutions.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Overall, the challenge-based modules and other innovations have moderate
   overall effects on improved student performance. They can be implemented
   successively by other instructors in a variety of educational settings
   and student populations.

AB The evaluation of efficiency scores in data envelopment analysis is
   based on the construction of artificial decision making units subject to
   some assumptions, usually requiring convexity of the production
   possibility set. This demands divisibility in input and output, which is
   not always possible. The so-called free replicability model, proposed by
   Henry Tulkens, permits input and output to enter in only discrete
   amounts. The model is of a mixed integer programming type, for which the
   number of variables, here corresponding to the decision making units,
   may be critical in order to reach an optimal solution. We suggest to use
   column generation techniques to include only those decision making units
   that may contribute to the creation of an optimal solution. (C) 2008

AB While other theorists have turned to Arendt's analysis of statelessness
   and superfluity to consider questions of immigration, "illegality," and
   the status of noncitizens, this essay argues that Arendt's account of
   labor and her non-consequentialist account of action offer a richer
   optic for considering the undocumented in the United States. To explore
   this claim, this essay constructs an alternate account of the nationwide
   demonstrations for immigrant rights that occurred in 2006. Rather than
   defining "success" in terms of replicability or immediate legislative
   results, the author's analysis of the 2006 protests emphasizes the
   significance of noncitizens laying claim to the public realm.
   Considering Michael Warner's concept of counterpublics, the author
   argues that the demonstrations can be best understood as a moment of
   initiation and an inaugural performance of the political. Rereading
   Arendt's notion of animal laborans, the essay concludes by exploring the
   limitations of noncitizens invoking labor as a way to gain civic
   standing.

AB Developmental scientists frequently seek to understand effects of
   environmental contexts on development. Traditional analytic strategies
   assume similar environmental effects for all children, sometimes
   exploring possible moderating influences or exceptions (e.g., outliers)
   as a secondary step. These strategies are poorly matched to ecological
   models of human development that posit complex individual by environment
   interactions. An alternative conceptual framework is proposed that tests
   the hypothesis that the environment has differential (nonuniform)
   effects on children. A demonstration of the utility of this framework is
   provided by examining the effects of family resources on children's
   academic outcomes in a multisite study (N = 6,305). Three distinctive
   groups of children were identified, including 1 group particularly
   resilient to influence of low levels of family resources. Predictors of
   group differences including parenting and child demographics are tested,
   the replicability of the results are examined, and findings are
   contrasted with those obtained with traditional regression interaction
   effects. This approach is proposed as a partial solution to advance
   theories of the environment, social ecological systems research. and
   behavioral genetics to create well-tailored environments for children.

AB Contrast effects have been studied in dozens of experimental paradigms,
   including the measurement of attitudes in the social psychological
   literature. However, nearly all of this work has been conducted using
   explicit reports. In the present research the authors employed a variety
   of different types of priming tasks in order to gain insight into the
   nature of contrast effects and the role that automatic processes might
   play in their emergence. They report 6 experiments. In Experiments 1 and
   2 the replicability and robustness of automatized contrast effects
   across 2 types of implicit tasks are established. Experiments 3-6 were
   conducted in order to further understand the nature of these effects and
   whether they are best understood in terms of spreading activation vs.
   response-based models of priming. In the course of accounting for their
   findings, the authors propose and validate a response-mapping framework,
   which provides insight into some longstanding ambiguities in the priming
   literature. Implications for theories of contrast and models of
   evaluative priming are discussed.

AB BACKGROUND: In modern clinical neuro-oncology, the pathologic diagnoses
   are very challenging, creating significant clinical confusion and
   affecting therapeutic decisions and prognosis, METHODS: TP53 and PTEN
   gene sequences were analyzed, and microarray expression profiling was
   also performed. The authors investigated whether gene expression
   profiling, coupled with class prediction methodology, could be used to
   determine the prognosis of gliomatosis cerebri in a more consistent
   manner than standard pathology. RESULTS: The authors reported the
   results of a molecular study in 59 cases of gliomatosis cerebri,
   correlating these results with prognosis. The well-known prognostic
   factors of gliomas (ie, age, Karnofsky performance status, histology
   [grade 2 vs 3], and contrast enhancement) were found to be predictive of
   response or outcome in only a percentage of patients but not in all
   patients. The authors identified a 23-gene signature that was able to
   predict patient prognosis with microarray gene expression profiling.
   With the aim of producing a prognosis too[ that is useful in clinical
   investigation, the authors studied the expression of this 23-gene
   signature by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Real-time
   expression values relative to these 23 gene features were used to build
   a prediction method able to distinguish patients with a good prognosis
   (those more likely to be responsive to therapy) from patients with a
   poor prognosis (those less likely to be responsive to therapy).
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study demonstrated not only a
   strong association between gene expression patterns and patient
   survival, but also a robust replicability of these gene expression-based
   predictors. Cancer 2009;115:3749-57. (C) 2009 American Cancer Society.

   Afzelius, a student of Carl Linnaeus. We amplified and sequenced a
   800-bp region between 16S ribosomal DNA and the 3' part of the trnI gene
   (16S-trnI) in the chloroplast genome of Phaulopsis talbotii S. Moore
   (Acanthaceae). To test the replicability and to control for
   contamination the procedure was performed in sealed vials and with
   negative PCR controls. The procedure was also repeated in a separate
   laboratory. In addition, the chloroplast rpl16 intron was successfully
   amplified and sequenced and the rps16 intron amplified. Sequences of
   taxa closely related to Acanthaceae were found to be most similar to the
   produced sequences. The results Suggest that molecular investigations of
   other 18th century botanical collections are feasible and that molecular
   methods could be employed for comparative studies to extant plant
   collections. An important application would be to identify descendants
   or clones of Linnaean lectotypes by comparing DNA from these with
   potentially remnant plants from Linnaeus' cultivations.

   'readily apparent, simple interpretation' of their ME)S solution and
   therefore suggested that the MDS approach may be flawed its a device for
   interpreting sexual assault. The current paper explains how the methods
   employed by Sturidsson et al. represent an incorrect use of MDS.,
   specifically in their input of Jaccard similarity data into the MDS
   (ALSCAL) procedure in SPSS as opposed to the correct MDS (PROXSCAL)
   procedure. A comparative example is used to illustrate how adopting the
   ALSCAL procedure will result in an inverse MDS solution, where objects
   appearing closer together arc more dissimilar, making interpretation of
   the MDS plot meaningless in this context. The current paper discusses
   this methodological flaw in greater depth and in the context of
   behavioural investigative research using MDS in general. It concludes
   with some general guidelines in utilizing the MDS procedure in SPSS

   similar conditions. To exclude the possible effects of within-cage order

   Neither male nor female mice housed individually showed stronger signs

AB In this paper, we propose definitions for a general, domain-independent
   concept of replicability and specifically focus on the notion of
   self-replication. We argue that self-replication should not be viewed as
   a binary property of a system, but rather as a continuously valued
   property of the interaction between a system and its environment. This
   property, self-replicability, represents the effect of the presence of a
   system upon the future presence of similar systems. We demonstrate both
   analytical and computational analysis of self-replicability for four
   distinct systems involving both discrete and continuous, formal and
   physical behaviors.

AB Understanding the genetics of behavioral variation remains a fascinating
   but difficult problem with considerable theoretical and practical
   implications. We used the genome-tagged mice (GTM) and an extensive test
   battery of well-validated behavioral assays to scan the genome for
   behavioral quantitative trait loci (QTLs). The GTM are a panel of 'speed
   congenic' mice consisting of over 60 strains spanning the entire
   autosomal genome. Each strain harbors a small (similar to 23 cM) DBA/2J
   donor segment on a uniform C57BL/6J background. The panel allows for
   mapping to regions as small as 5 cM and provides a powerful new tool for
   increasing mapping power and replicability in the analysis of QTLs. A
   total of 97 loci were mapped for a variety of complex behavioral traits
   including hyperactivity, anxiety, prepulse inhibition, avoidance and
   conditional fear. A larger number of loci were recovered than generally
   attained from standard mapping crosses. In addition, a surprisingly high
   proportion of loci, 63%, showed phenotypes unlike either of the parental
   strains. These data suggest that epistasis decreases sensitivity of
   locus detection in traditional crosses and demonstrate the utility of
   the GTM for mapping complex behavioral traits with high sensitivity and
   precision. Molecular Psychiatry (2009) 14, 631-645;

   of explicit, direct comparisons of obtained effect sizes with those in

AB This paper presents findings from a study on urban poor housing in Dhaka
   city. Dhaka is a burgeoning mega city and capital of Bangladesh with
   population of over 12 million, 30 percent of which lives in informal
   settlements and is classified as urban poor. To make housing programs
   accessible to the urban poor, the apportioned cost must be affordable to
   them. As the resources of Government are meager, housing programs can
   only be sustained if aimed at full cost recovery. This study seeks to
   contribute to a sustainable approach of affordable housing for the urban
   poor by reviewing existing housing situation and supply trend. With a
   particular reference to 'Bhashantek Rehabilitation Project (BRP)',
   devised to house 80,000 urban poor, it addresses aptness of the project
   based on 'affordability', 'cost recovery' and 'replicability' concepts.
   The study revealed that the foreseeable outcome of the project has a
   clear disparity with its aim which might not contribute well to curve
   the housing dearth. Later, the study approaches the concept of tenement
   apartments for the impoverished city dwellers. Study results expose the
   preeminence of tenement apartments by admitting the trilogy which is
   affordable, capital recoverable and sustainable to replicate housing.

   operationalizing mental health and identifying parsimonious ways of

   to investigate the replicability of the structure of C. L. M. Keyes's
   (2002) model of mental health in 2 samples of college students (total N
   = 244 women and 223 men). Results of confirmatory factor analyses
   supported this 3-factor model of psychological, social, and emotional
   well-being, consisting of 14 subdimensions. Furthermore, this model was
   found to be invariant for men and women in both samples. The secondary
   purpose was to assess the effectiveness of personal growth initiative
   (PGI; C. Robitschek, 1998) as a parsimonious predictor (i.e., 1
   predictor for many outcomes) of these multiple dimensions of mental
   health. Results of structural equation modeling supported PGI as a
   parsimonious predictor of Keyes's multidimensional mental health model
   for men and women in both groups. Limitations are discussed, and
   implications for research and practice in counseling psychology are
   presented.

   configurations of life satisfaction (LS), positive affect (PA), and
   negative affect (NA) were explored using cluster analysis. Five distinct
   SWB configurations replicated within and across two samples (N = 756
   first-year undergraduates; N = 550 community adults). A substantial
   number of participants reported a profile indicative of "high SWB" (high
   LS, frequent PA, infrequent NA). Consistent with expectations, these
   individuals were characterized by elevated mental, physical, and
   interpersonal functioning. In contrast, people with a "low SWB" profile
   reported the greatest dysfunction. Across the five clusters, however,
   adaptive functioning was not unique to individuals reporting a high SWB
   profile, nor was dysfunction unique to people characterized by a low SWB
   configuration. Results are discussed in terms of compensation and strain
   processes hypothesized by Shmotkin (2005). Implications for future

AB The probabiliry of "replication," p(rep), has been proposed as a means
   of identifying replicable and reliable effects in the psychological
   sciences. We conduct a basic test of p(rep) that reveals that it
   misestimates the true probability of replication, especially for small
   effects. We show how these general problems with p(rep) play out in
   practice, when it is applied to predict the replicability of observed
   effects over a series of experiments. Our results show that, over any
   plausible series of experiments, the true probabilities of replication
   will be very different from those predicted by p(rep). We discuss some
   basic problems in the formulation of p(rep) that are responsible for its
   poor performance, and conclude that p(rep) is not a usifitil statistic

AB Therapeutic decision-making in primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is becoming
   more challenging because of the increasing use of allogeneic stem cell
   transplantation and new investigational drugs. To enhance this process
   by developing a highly discriminative prognostic system, 1054 patients
   consecutively diagnosed with PMF at 7 centers were studied. Overall
   median survival was 69 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 61-76).
   Multivariate analysis of parameters obtained at disease diagnosis
   identified age greater than 65 years, presence of constitutional
   symptoms, hemoglobin level less than 10 g/dL, leukocyte count greater
   than 25 x 10(9)/L, and circulating blast cells 1% or greater as
   predictors of shortened survival. Based on the presence of 0 (low risk),
   1 (intermediate risk-1), 2 (intermediate risk-2) or greater than or
   equal to 3 (high risk) of these variables, 4 risk groups with no
   overlapping in their survival curves were delineated; respective median
   survivals were 135, 95, 48, and 27 months (P < .001). Compared with
   prior prognostic models, the new risk stratification system displayed
   higher predictive accuracy, replicability, and discriminating power. In
   409 patients with assessable metaphases, cytogenetic abnormalities were
   associated with shorter survival, but their independent contribution to
   prognosis was restricted to patients in the intermediate-risk groups.
   JAK2V617F did not cluster with a specific risk group or affect survival.

   Methodologic replicability enhances our ability to detect signals of

   the intervention, and by reducing the obscuring effects of noise.
   Decision-support tools are intended to standardize some aspect of
   clinical care and thereby help lead to uniform implementation of
   clinical interventions. This is realized by explicit replicable computer
   protocols that can produce appropriate patient-specific decisions and
   introduce control of process into clinical care. Development of such
   protocols has required around-the-clock implementation for patient
   management because of the influence of patient history and previous
   patient states on the output of the computer protocol. Three successful
   computer protocols for management of blood glucose provide compelling
   examples. This clinician driven "bottom-up" approach complements the

AB Animal models play a central role in all areas of biomedical research.
   The process of animal model building, development and evaluation has
   rarely been addressed systematically, despite the long history of using
   animal models in the investigation of neuropsychiatric disorders and
   behavioral dysfunctions. An iterative, multi-stage trajectory for
   developing animal models and assessing their quality is proposed. The
   process starts with defining the purpose(s) of the model, preferentially
   based on hypotheses about brain-behavior relationships. Then, the model
   is developed and tested. The evaluation of the model takes scientific
   and ethical criteria into consideration.
   Model development requires a multidisciplinary approach. Preclinical and
   clinical experts should establish a set of scientific criteria, which a
   model must meet. The scientific evaluation consists of assessing the
   replicability/reliability, predictive, construct and external
   validity/generalizability, and relevance of the model. We emphasize the
   role of (systematic and extended) replications in the course of the
   validation process. One may apply a multiple-tiered 'replication
   battery' to estimate the reliability/replicability, validity, and
   generalizability of result.
   Compromised welfare is inherent in many deficiency models in animals.
   Unfortunately, 'animal welfare' is a vaguely defined concept, making it
   difficult to establish exact evaluation criteria. Weighing the animal's
   welfare and considerations as to whether action is indicated to reduce
   the discomfort must accompany the scientific evaluation at any stage of
   the model building and evaluation process. Animal model building should
   be discontinued if the model does not meet the preset scientific
   criteria, or when animal welfare is severely compromised. The
   application of the evaluation procedure is exemplified using the rat
   with neonatal hippocampal lesion as a proposed model of schizophrenia.
   In a manner congruent to that for improving animal models, guided by the
   procedure expounded upon in this paper, the developmental and evaluation
   procedure itself may be improved by careful definition of the purpose(s)
   of a model and by defining better evaluation criteria, based on the
   proposed use of the model.

   the replacement of the usual solid blocks by an assembly of blocks in
   such a way that the test can evaluate weld beads on thin sheets. Student
   t distribution is applied to examine the functionality of the proposed
   test. Weld metals were deposited with flux-cored wires E71T-1 and
   E71T8-K6, with diameters of 1.6 and 1.7 mm, respectively, under two
   different preheating temperatures. Metal susceptibility to hydrogen
   cracking was evaluated by the presence and percentage of cracks in the
   weld metal. In order to evaluate and verify the functionality of the new
   G-BOP test proposal, the following were examined: efficiency of the new
   test in inducing hydrogen cracks in the weld metal, result
   replicability, fracture modes present in cracks, and the cooling rate
   imposed on the welding zone. Results showed that the new G-BOP test
   proposal is viable; results were replicable and the test was efficient
   in inducing cracks in weld metal with a confidence of 90%.

   The main advantages of a rubber support, instead of a hard counter-tool,
   include simplification of the embossing tool, protection of the
   embossing master, buildup of uniform embossing pressure, and ease of
   demolding. The testing pattern for rubber-assisted embossing was a
   microgroove pattern with a characteristic size of 100 mu m on a 25-mu m
   thick polystyrene film. Results showed that the uniformity and
   replicability of the embossed pattern were significantly affected by the
   embossing temperature, the rubber hardness, and the embossing pressure.
   With an embossing temperature about 20 degrees C above the glass
   transition temperature and appropriate rubber hardness and embossing
   force, uniform microgroove patterns were successfully replicated.

   post-SAP policies adopted by the state, best illustrated by its steady
   withdrawal of support from its welfare agenda. While the Bhoomi project
   is primarily a state-based project, the Gyan Ganga project is a joint
   state-private sector initiative aimed at the use of ICTs in development.
   Bhoomi, involves the digitalisation of all land records in Karnataka,
   and the provision of access to these records via information kiosks and
   fingerprint authentication systems. Gyan Ganga, is an ambitious project
   aimed at the provision of information, connectivity, education, e-health
   and e-governance broadly with in the parameters of the right to
   information, in the state of Gujarat. Whereas both projects have, at
   least on paper, tremendous potential - in the case of Bhoomi, to bypass
   corrupt land revenue officers and their power to control access to these
   records, and to bring some transparency in land revenue transactions and
   records, and in the case of Gyan Ganga to bring the multiple benefits of
   the information revolution to the rural masses, both projects, along
   with other similar ICTs for development projects in India, face a range
   of problems. These include issues related to replicability and content
   provision, but also a deeply rooted technological determinism that
   assumes that the layering of ICTs in development will automatically
   solve the many issues related to the provision of `access' to this
   information. In this article I argue that the inability to factor in
   real-life contestations in the field, to deal with pre-existing
   constraints related to gender, caste, feudalism, privilege and
   traditional exercises of power, limits the real potential of ICTs in
   development. I also argue that the right to information movement in
   India offers pointers towards making e-projects relevant and responsive
   to people's real information and knowledge needs. [All rights reserved

AB Despite developments in error modeling in discrete objects and
   continuous fields, there exist substantial and largely unsolved
   conceptual problems in the domain of nominal fields. This article
   explores a novel strategy for uncertainty characterization in spatial
   categorical information. The proposed strategy is based on discriminant
   space, which is defined with essential properties or driving processes
   underlying spatial class occurrences, leading to discriminant models of
   uncertainty in area classes. This strategy reinforces consistency in
   categorical mapping by imposing class-specific mean structures that can
   be regressed against discriminant variables, and facilitates
   scale-dependent error modeling that can effectively emulate the
   variation found between observers in terms of classes, boundary
   positions, numbers of polygons, and boundary network topology. Based on
   simulated data, comparisons with stochastic simulation based on
   indicator kriging confirmed the replicability of the discriminant
   models, which work by determining the mean area classes based on
   discriminant variables and projecting spatially correlated residuals in
   discriminant space to uncertainty in area classes.

AB Non-cryogenic tissue preservation and DNA extraction: an application for
   cartilaginous fishes. Conservation of tissue samples and quality of the
   DNA are crucial for the molecular techniques to work properly. For this
   reason, the standardization of the methods for tissue preservation and
   DNA extraction is basic, considering the availability of resources and
   its replicability. Five tissue preservation methods, two tissue types
   and five extraction protocols were evaluated qualitatively,
   quantitatively and statistically. No significant differences among
   tissues were observed, while there were differences in the preservation
   methods and extraction protocols. Considering the cost/benefit relation
   and quantity of DNA, the most efficient protocols were six and nine,
   which used samples preserved in ethanol at -20 [degrees]C or with an
   extraction buffer without protease in non-cryogenic condition. For that
   matter, in optimal conditions (enough time, economic resources and
   complete infrastructure) is recommended to maintain 5-20mg of tissue in
   cold ethanol (with a posterior cryogenic maintenance), coming with a DNA
   extraction made with P9 or an appropriate kit. However if the condition
   is of scarce resources, the best choice is to maintain 5-20mg in
   Ethanol-EDTA (For short term preservation or Longmire's buffer (for
   longer terms) and extract the DNA with protocol 6 or 9 depending on
   purity needs.

PY 2009
AB Background: A group of experts attending a tripartite interregional
   meeting on best practices in HIV/AIDS workplace policies and programmes
   organised by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) in Geneva,
   Switzerland, identified 34 best practice workplace HIV programmes from
   across the world. Method: The ten criteria that were used for reviewing
   best practice workplace HIV/AIDS programmes in South Africa include
   acceptability, accessibility, ethical soundness, perceived impact,
   relevance, appropriateness, innovativeness, efficiency, sustainability
   and replicability. Results: More than one-third (35.3%) of the 34 best
   practice workplace interventions identified were found in businesses and
   industries in South Africa. This constitutes a significant and
   encouraging effort to deal with HIV/AIDS in the workplace. Approximately
   16.7% of the best practice workplace HIV/AIDS interventions focused on
   policy and legal frameworks, 50% of these interventions focused on
   prevention, 16.7% provided links beyond the workplace and a further
   16.7% were interventions that focused on knowledge and evidence. A third
   (33.3%) of practices were found in the mining industry, 16.7% in the
   motor industry, 16.7% from workers' unions, and the rest (33.3%) were
   found in a sugar company, an electricity supply company, a
   pharmaceutical company and the ministry of Public Service and
   Administration. Conclusion: It is encouraging that over one-third of all
   best practice workplace HIV interventions identified by the ILO experts
   were found in South Africa. The majority of these policies and
   programmes were focused on HIV prevention.

AB Purpose - The concept of "traceability as a strategy and mandatory
   initiative" has replaced that of "traceability as a cost of a business
   or as a voluntary responsibility". This implies that the introduction of
   a traceability system should be perceived and positioned as a catalyst
   for better business practices. However, despite these benefits, a
   traceability system is also investment-worthy. Hence, the value of
   investment in a traceability system constitutes a matter of considerable
   concern and debate for both practitioners and academics alike. This
   paper seeks to present a cost-benefit evaluation applied in a natural
   mineral water company regarding the pilot deployment of an
   electronic-based traceability system.
   Design/methodology/approach - This is a case based study.
   Findings - Based on the experience described previously, a high-level
   framework is generated that any organisation can refer to as a proper
   guideline in order to demonstrate how the costs and benefits can be
   compared for overall evaluation of the deployment of any traceability
   system. The details of the framework are described by applying it to a
   specific case.
   Practical implications - The present framework has theoretical interest
   for replicability in a different number of food sectors.
   Originality/value - The paper contributes to closing the existing gap
   regarding the theoretical approach that food traceability systems can
   adopt when their costs and benefits are investigated.

AB The determination of trichlorobenzenes(TCBs) in water-based cutting
   fluids and wastewater of machining has been carried out.A gas
   chromatography/mass spectrometry(GC/MS) method with selected ion
   monitoring(SIM) mode was employed.The target analyte was extracted from
   the matrix using dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction.Comparing with
   gas chromatography/electronic capture detection(GC/ECD) coupled with
   traditional sample preparation procedures,e.g.head-space
   extraction,liquid-liquid extraction and solid-phase extraction,the
   present method was accurate with broader linear range,better enrichment
   property,better replicability,easier to be operated and less
   interference.Overall recoveries were 94.7%-104.3% with the relative
   standard deviations(RSDs) of at 2.3%-7.8%.The detective limits for
   1,3,5-,1,2,4-and 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene were 2.0,6.0 and 3.0
   mug/L,respectively.The parameters,such as the nature and volume of
   extraction solvent,dispersive solvent,extraction time and salt
   effect,were studied and optimized.Some important factors,e.g.,the
   concentration of common used additives in water-based cutting
   fluids,which may affect the recoveries and replicabilities for the
   determination of trichlorobenzenes,have been investigated.The result
   showed that no significant effects have been observed when the
   concentrations of NaNO2 and polyethylene glycol(PEG) were up to 1.0
   %.The present method has been applied for the determination of the
   trichlorobenzenes in 4 real samples.The result showed that two of them
   were found to contain these trichlorobenzenes.The TCBs in the samples
   were 0.15-1.67 mg/L.

AB Background
   Conditional cash transfers (CCT) provide monetary transfers to
   households on the condition that they comply with some pre-defined
   requirements. CCT programmes have been justified on the grounds that
   demand-side subsidies are necessary to address inequities in access to
   health and social services for poor people. In the past decade they have
   become increasingly popular, particularly in middle income countries in
   Latin America.
   Objectives
   To assess the effectiveness of CCT in improving access to care and
   health outcomes, in particular for poorer populations in low and middle
   income countries.
   Search strategy
   We searched a wide range of international databases, including the
   Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and
   EMBASE, in addition to development studies and economic databases. We
   also searched the websites and online resources of numerous
   international agencies, organisations and universities to find relevant
   grey literature. The original searches were conducted between November
   2005 and April 2006. An updated search in MEDLINE was carried out in May
   2009.
   Selection criteria
   CCT were defined asmonetary transfers made to households on the
   condition that they comply with some pre-determined requirements in
   relation to health care. Studies had to include an objective measure of
   at least one of the following outcomes: health care utilisation, health
   expenditure, health outcomes or equity outcomes. Eligible study designs
   were: randomised controlled trial, interrupted time series analysis, or
   controlled before-after study of the impact of health financing policies
   following criteria used by the Cochrane Effective Practice and
   Organisation of Care Group. Data collection and analysis We performed
   qualitative analysis of the evidence.
   Main result
   We included ten papers reporting results from six intervention studies.
   Overall, design quality and analysis limited the risks of bias. Several
   CCT programmes provided strong evidence of a positive impact on the use
   of health services, nutritional status and health outcomes, respectively
   assessed by anthropometric measurements and self-reported episodes of
   illness. It is hard to attribute these positive effects to the cash
   incentives specifically because other components may also contribute.
   Several studies provide evidence of positive impacts on the uptake of
   preventive services by children and pregnant women. We found no evidence
   about effects on health care expenditure.
   Authors' conclusions
   Conditional cash transfer programmes have been the subject of some
   well-designed evaluations, which strongly suggest that they could be an
   effective approach to improving access to preventive services. Their
   replicability under different conditions - particularly in more deprived
   settings - is still unclear because they depend on effective primary
   health care and mechanisms to disburse payments. Further rigorous
   evaluative research is needed, particularly where CCTs are being
   introduced in low income countries, for example in Sub-Saharan Africa or
   South Asia.

   in children with dyslexia. Seventy children with dyslexia and 52 normal
   readers were tested twice, 9 months apart, on measures of visual and
   auditory sensory processing and on phonological and orthographic skills.
   About 30% of children with dyslexia were found to have sensory deficits.
   Associations were found between sensory and cognitive skills. Based on
   analyses of agreement, the temporal stability of the sensory tasks was
   poor. Future research should develop sensory measures with high temporal
   stability that can control for maturation.

AB Despite their high vulnerability to depression, a majority of

   psychologic services. These older adults require both social services
   for managing their multiple financial and functional needs and
   psychologic services for managing their depression. Mental health needs

   provide both social services and psychotherapy. This study outlines the

   homebound older adults and the need for research evidence on the
   feasibility, efficacy, and replicability of implementing such an

AB The mutual fund theorem (MFT) is considered in a general semimartingale
   financial market S with a finite time horizon T, where agents maximize
   expected utility of terminal wealth. The main results are: (i) Let N be
   the wealth process of the numeraire portfolio (i.e., the optimal
   portfolio for the log utility). If any path-independent option with
   maturity T written on the numeraire portfolio can be replicated by
   trading only in N and the risk-free asset, then the MFT holds true for
   general utility functions, and the numeraire portfolio may serve as
   mutual fund. This generalizes Merton's classical result on
   Black-Merton-Scholes markets as well as the work of Chamberlain in the
   framework of Brownian filtrations (Chamberlain in Econometrica
   56:1283-1300, 1988).
   Conversely, under a supplementary weak completeness assumption, we show
   that the validity of the MFT for general utility functions implies the
   replicability property for options on the numeraire portfolio described
   above.
   If for a given class of utility functions (i.e., investors) the MFT
   holds true in all complete Brownian financial markets S, then all
   investors use the same utility function U, which must be of HARA type.
   This is a result in the spirit of the classical work by Cass and
   Stiglitz.

AB BACKGROUND: Yuli Veterans Hospital (YVH) has been the largest mental
   hospital for the patients with chronic and severe mental illness in
   Taiwan for the past 50 years. While this hospital used to be a symbol of
   hopelessness among patients and their families and an unspoken shame
   among Taiwan psychiatry and mental health circles it now represents an
   example of how an old, custodial hospital can be transformed into a very
   different institution. In this case study we will describe the features
   of this transformation, which, over the past 20 years, has aimed to help
   extended stay inpatients with severe mental illness to integrate into
   the local community of Yuli even though it is not their original home.
   METHODS: Using historical documents and oral narratives from Yuli
   inhabitants, workers and patients of YVH, we will offer a case study of
   the Yuli model.
   RESULTS: There are four main components of the Yuli model: holistic
   medical support, vocational rehabilitation, case management, and the
   residential program. The four components help patients recover two
   essential features of their lives: vocational life and ordinary daily
   routines. As the process of recovery evolves, patients gradually regain
   inner stability, dignity, self-confidence, and a sense of control. The
   four components are critical to rebuild the structure and order of life
   of the patients and are indispensable and interdependent parts of one
   service package. They operate simultaneously to benefit the patients to
   the greatest degree possible.
   DISCUSSION: There are many challenges to the further development and
   financial viability of the model of services developed at YVH. There are
   also important questions concerning the replicability of the Yuli model
   in other sociocultural and service system contexts.
   CONCLUSION: This case study reveals the possibility of transforming a
   custodial mental hospital into a hospital providing high quality care.
   Hospital and community are not in opposition. They are part of a
   continuum of care for the patients. We reinterpret and redefine the
   boundary and function of hospital and community, and thereby create a
   new service model, the Yuli Model, to help patients to reintegrate into
   the community. The Yuli model, which particularly focuses on the needs
   of people with long-standing illness and prolonged hospital stay,
   illustrates one approach to linking hospital and community in a creative
   and constructive manner.

AB Urban community gardens worldwide provide significant health benefits to
   those gardening and consuming fresh produce from them. Urban gardens are
   most often placed in locations and on land in which soil contaminants
   reflect past practices and often contain elevated levels of metals and
   organic contaminants. Garden plot dividers made from either railroad
   ties or chromated copper arsenate (CCA) pressure treated lumber
   contribute to the soil contamination and provide a continuous source of
   contaminants. Elevated levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)
   derived from railroad ties and arsenic from CCA pressure treated lumber
   are present in the gardens studied. Using a representative garden, we
   (1) determined the nature and extent of urban community garden soil
   contaminated with PAHs and arsenic by garden timbers; (2) designed a
   remediation plan, based on our sampling results, with our community
   partner guided by public health criteria, local regulation,
   affordability, and replicability; (3) determined the safety and
   advisability of adding city compost to Boston community gardens as a
   soil amendment; and (4) made recommendations for community gardeners
   regarding healthful gardening practices. This is the first study of its
   kind that looks at contaminants other than lead in urban garden soil and
   that evaluates the effect on select soil contaminants of adding city
   compost to community garden soil.

   (PHLOC) scales in an Italian sample.
   Method: The Italian version of PHLOC was administered to 470 mothers of
   birth to 3-year-old children.
   Results: Varimax rotated confirmatory factor analysis identified the six
   original subscales, namely Child, Divine, Fate, Media, Parental, and
   Professional influences over child health. Internal consistency of the
   subscales was good (alpha > .70), and test-retest correlations were
   adequate (r > .80). More highly educated mothers rated media influence
   as most important. No differences were found considering children's age,
   gender, and birth order.
   Conclusion: The results offer good evidence of the cross-cultural
   validity of the PHLOC scales, an instrument that can be useful in
   interventions with families by the health care practitioners to prevent
   neglectful childrearing practices.

   Discontinued production of the enzyme Rhozyme-S required for AOAC Method
   920.40 invalidated this method for starch in animal feeds. The objective
   of this study was to compare methods for the determination of starch as
   potential candidates as a replacement method and for an AOAC
   collaborative study. Many starch methods are available, but they vary in
   accuracy, replicability, and ease of use. After assays were evaluated
   that differed in gelatinization method, number of reagents, and sample
   handling, and after assays with known methodological defects were
   excluded, 3 enzymatic-colorimetric assays were selected for comparison.
   The assays all used 2-stage, heat-stable, alpha-amylase and
   amyloglucosidase hydrolyses, but they differed in the gelatinization
   solution (heating in water, 3-(N-morpholino) propanesulfonic acid
   buffer, or acetate buffer). The measured values included both starch and
   maltooligosaccharides. The acetate buffer-only method was performed in
   sealable vessels with dilution by weight; it gave greater starch values
   (2-6 percentage units of sample dry matter) in the analysis of feed/food
   substrates than did the other methods. This method is a viable candidate
   for a collaborative study.

   With an observer-rated measure of child self-regulation, we illustrate
   how multiple sources of error variance (e.g., raters, items) affect the
   dependability (replicability) of scores and demonstrate methods for
   enhancing dependability of observer ratings. Using ratings of 181
   children, we illustrate the use of two-facet (i.e., raters and items as
   sources of error) and three-facet (i.e., raters, items and occasions)
   analyses to optimize design features of future studies using this
   measure. In addition, we show how generalizability theory provides a
   useful conceptual framework for thinking about determinants of scores on
   acquaintance (e.g., teacher or parent) ratings, as well as observer
   ratings, and sheds light on the strengths and limitations of both types
   of data for child and adolescent clinical research.

AB The determination of trichlorobenzenes (TCBs) in water-based cutting
   fluids and wastewater of machining has been carried out. A gas
   chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/ MS) method with selected ion
   monitoring (SIM) mode was employed. The target analyte was extracted
   from the matrix using dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction.
   Comparing with gas chromatography/electronic capture detection (GC/ECD)
   coupled with traditional sample preparation procedures, e.g. head-space
   extraction, liquid-liquid extraction and solid-phase extraction, the
   present method was accurate with broader linear range, better enrichment
   property, better replicability, easier to be operated and less
   interference. Overall recoveries were 94.7% - 104.3% with the relative
   standard deviations (RSDs) of at 2.3% - 7.8%. The detective limits for
   1,3,5-, 1,2,4- and 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene were 2.0, 6.0 and 3.0
   microg/L, respectively. The parameters, such as the nature and volume of
   extraction solvent, dispersive solvent, extraction time and salt effect,
   were studied and optimized. Some important factors, e.g., the
   concentration of common used additives in water-based cutting fluids,
   which may affect the recoveries and replicabilities for the
   determination of trichlorobenzenes, have been investigated. The result
   showed that no significant effects have been observed when the
   concentrations of NaNO2 and polyethylene glycol (PEG) were up to 1.0%.
   The present method has been applied for the determination of the
   trichlorobenzenes in 4 real samples. The result showed that two of them
   were found to contain these trichlorobenzenes. The TCBs in the samples
   were 0.15 - 1.67 mg/L.

AB Introduction: Endoscopic technique is gaining importance in treatment of
   arachnoid cysts (AC). Recommended procedures include cystocisternostomy
   and cystoventriculostomy. Long-term potency and functional efficacy of
   such connections remain a topic of discussion.
   Aim: To present early and long-term outcome after endoscopic
   cystocisternostomy and cystoventriculostomy, in which functional
   efficacy was supported with a silicone elastomer catheter.
   Material and methods: The study included 13 adults with symptomatic AC
   treated during an 8-year period. In 7 cases of cysts of the lateral
   cerebral fissure, cystocisternostomy with optic chiasm cistern, carotid
   artery cistern or prepontine cistern was performed. Six arachnoid cysts
   located on the brain convexity were opened to the lateral ventricle by
   cystoventriculostomy. Because of the anatomical situation, in none of
   the cases was the communication wide enough to warrant long-term
   potency, which was secured by use of a silicone elastomer catheter or a
   set of catheters. Results of the treatment were assessed based on
   predefined clinical and radiological criteria The follow-up period
   ranged from 2.5 to 6 years.
   Results: Clinical condition improved in 11 patients (84.6%). In 12
   patients (92.3%) the size of the cyst decreased. Significant changes
   occurred 6-12 months after the procedure. No improvement was noted in
   half of patients with epilepsy, and a small radiological improvement was
   noted in cysts of the lateral cerebral fissure. Two patients required
   prolonged observation because of onset of asymptomatic subdural
   haematoma
   Conclusions: Regarding safety, replicability, efficacy and low
   complication rate, use of a silicone elastomer catheter is a promising
   solution in the endoscopic treatment of selected patients with AC.

AB Analysis of mass death events, often involving partial or skeletal human
   remains, requires investigators to condense information on a large
   number of victims into a single report. Prosecution of war crimes
   typically requires that victims be categorized according to the injuries
   sustained. Reports recognizing only the presence or absence of trauma
   are misleading or misrepresentative. This study introduces a 4 class
   system for skeletal remains based on morphologic autopsy findings. Each
   class corresponds to the lethal potential of the trauma or pathologic
   conditions evident at autopsy, and the certainty with which cause of
   death can be determined. Data were extracted from 766 autopsy cases
   involving decomposed or skeletal remains from the New Mexico Office of
   the Medical Investigator in which cause and manner of death were ruled.
   Statistically significant associations between morphology class and the
   cause and manner of death, positive identification, and natural and
   non-natural deaths were evident in this study. Intraobserver and
   interobserver tests revealed excellent replicability and reliability in
   the assignment of morphology classes to individual cases. In addition to
   its mass death applications, this classification system offers potential
   research contributions to physical anthropologists and bioarchaeologists
   studying human populations in antiquity.

AB The authors examined the psychometric properties, factor structure, and
   construct validity of the Dissociative Experiences Scale ( DES) in a
   large offender sample (N = 1,515). Although the DES is widely used with
   community and clinical samples, minimal work has examined offender
   samples. Participants were administered self-report and interview
   measures, and a subsample was followed longitudinally to determine
   criminal and violent recidivism. The DES exhibited good psychometric
   properties, but an identified three-factor structure was of questionable
   replicability. Moreover, the DES factors displayed no evidence of
   differential correlates. DES total scores were correlated with
   trauma-related variables even after controlling for negative
   affectivity. Total scores were related to measures of antisocial
   behavior and aggression but did not predict recidivism. These findings
   support the reliability and construct validity of the DES in offenders
   but raise questions regarding the clinical utility of the DES factor
   scores above and beyond that of the total score.

   frameworks. Despite the apparent plethora of Concept Analysis frameworks
   used in nursing Studies We found that over half of those used were
   derived from the work of one author. This paper explores the Suitability
   and use Of these frameworks and is set at a time when the numbers of
   published concept analysis papers are increasing.
   For the purpose Of this study thirteen commonly used frameworks,
   identified from the nursing Journals 1993 to 2005. were explored to
   reveal their origins. Ontological and philosophical stance, and any
   common elements. The frameworks Were critiqued and links made between
   their antecedents.
   It was noted if the articles contained discussion of an), possible
   tensions between the ontological perspective of the framework used. the
   process of analysis. praxis and possible nursing theory developments. It
   was found that the thirteen identified frameworks are mainly based on
   hermeneutic propositions regarding understandings and are interpretive
   procedures founded oil self-reflective modes of discovery. Six
   frameworks rely oil or include the use of casuistry. Seven of the
   frameworks identified are predicated on, or adapt the work of Wilson, a
   school master writing for his pupils. Wilson's framework has a
   simplistic eleven step. binary and reductionist structure. Other
   frameworks identified include Morse et al's framework which this article
   suggests employs a contestable theory of concept Maturity.
   Based on the findings revealed through Our exploration of the use of
   concept analysis frameworks in the nursing literature, concerns were
   raised regarding the unjustified adaptation and alterations and the
   uncritical use of the frameworks. There is little evidence that these
   frameworks provide the necessary depth, rigor or replicability to enable
   the development in nursing theory which they underpin. (C) 2008 Elsevier

   comprehensive set of child characteristics was included in the analysis,
   together covering the most important aspects of five-year-olds'
   development and functioning. Three groups of children emerged, which
   were labeled Well-adapted/Competent, Underachieving/Internalizing, and
   Maladapted/Externalizing. Well-adapted/Competent children (59%) were
   competent and well-adjusted in all domains. The Maladapted/Externalizing
   children (22%) scored low in almost all domains of competence and
   functioning, and the Underachieving/Internalizing children (22%) showed
   a mixed profile of competence and adaptation. The differences in the
   quality of parent-child interaction that were observed between the
   groups provide clues as to how the different profiles of competence and
   adaptation are shaped and maintained in the interactions with parents.

AB Nowadays, much debate in the bereavement domain is directed towards the
   inclusion of Complicated Grief (CG) as a separate category in the
   Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Important within
   this discussion is the conceptual relationship between CG reactions and
   normal grief (NG) reactions. This study aims at elucidating this
   relationship by using data from 456 bereaved young adults, aged 17 to 25
   years. We examined the structural distinctiveness of CG and NG
   reactions, using two criteria sets. The first set ties in with previous
   research in bereaved adults on the distinctiveness of CG and NG and
   allows to test the replicability of earlier findings. The second set
   links up with the recently revised criteria for CG and permits to
   investigate whether earlier findings hold for the new criteria. For both
   sets, two models for NG and CG were compared using confirmatory factor
   analytic procedures. These analyses revealed that CG and NG reactions
   can be distinguished by their very nature, except for one CG reaction
   (viz. 'yearning'), that loaded on both factors. Copyright (C) 2008 John

   for the Improvement of Addiction Treatment (NIATx): enhancing access and
   retention. Drug Alcohol Depend. 88, 138-145]. A second cohort of
   outpatient (n = 10) and intensive outpatient (n = 4) treatment centers
   tested the replicability of the NIATx model. An additional 20 months of
   data from the original cohort (7 outpatient, 4 intensive outpatient, and
   4 residential treatment centers) assessed long-term sustainability. The
   replication analysis found a 38% reduction in days to treatment (30.7 to
   19.4 days) during an 18-month intervention. Retention in care improved
   13% from the first to second session of care (from 75.4% to 85.0%), 12%
   between the first and third session of care (69.2-77.7%), and 18%
   between the first and fourth session of care (57.1-67.5%). The
   sustainability analysis suggested that treatment centers maintained the
   reductions in days to treatment and the enhanced retention in care.
   Replication of the NIATx improvements in a second cohort of treatment
   centers increases confidence in the application of process improvements
   to treatment for alcohol and drug disorders. The ability to sustain the
   gains after project awards were exhausted suggests that participating
   programs institutionalized the organizational changes that led to the
   enhanced performance. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

AB BACKGROUND: Sexual risk taking during adolescence such as failure to use
   contraception or condoms is associated with premature parenthood and
   high rates of sexually transmitted infection. The relation of childhood
   personality to sexual risk taking during adolescence has been largely
   unexplored.
   METHODS: Using data collected from participants in the Child Sample of
   the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (CS-NLSY) when they were 5 or
   6 years of age (time 1) and 17 or 18 years of age (time 2), the relation
   of childhood personality to sexual risk taking during adolescence was
   investigated. Maternal ratings of childhood personality were used to
   derive resiliency, undercontrol, and overcontrol prototypical profile
   scores for a diverse sample of 1219 child participants from the CS-NLSY.
   At time 2, participants reported whether they failed to use oral
   contraception or condoms during their last sexual intercourse. Logistic
   regression models were used to investigate the association of
   personality to sexual risk taking.
   RESULTS: Proximity to the overcontrolled personality prototype at time 1
   was associated with a decreased likelihood of sexual risk taking. Age,
   male gender, and childhood cognitive achievement were also significant
   predictors of sexual risk taking.
   CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that children with personality
   profiles in which internalizing traits are more prominent are less
   likely than their peers to engage in sexual risk taking during late
   adolescence. The findings of this study augment previous studies that
   indicate that personality is an important predictor of development and
   underscore the importance of conducting research into the processes by
   which personality influences health behavior.

AB The variationist paradigm in sociolinguistics is at a disadvantage when
   dealing with variables that are traditionally treated qualitatively,
   e.g., 'identity'. This study essays to level the accuracy and
   descriptive value of qualitative research in a quantitative setting by
   rendering such a variable quantitatively accessible. To this end, a
   scoring system for 'regional identity' is innovated. The system, Scova,
   is employed in a Study conducted in Louisville, KY, that investigates
   the monophthongization of /ai/ in relation to the linguistic expression
   of identity. The Scova system devised here is designed to provide
   researchers a tool to rate qualitative variables such as identity with
   reasonable objectivity and replicability, utilizing emic criteria taken
   from each interview individually to assign positive or negative point
   values to statements made by informants in that interview, with the
   result that each informant generates a score that may be compared across
   informants and used in statistical analysis. The results of statistical
   analysis offer promising evidence for the system's effectiveness and
   potential application in future research. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Previous research on psychological contracts has focused on whether or

   them. Instead, here we examine how perceptions of the external labor
   market, particularly about whether present psychological contracts could
   be replicated elsewhere, influence employees' attachment to their
   current employers. In a longitudinal study of a diverse employee sample,
   we found perceptions that psychological contracts could not be
   replicated elsewhere accounted for a substantial amount of the variance
   in affective commitment (.38) and normative commitment (.29) and a
   smaller, but significant, amount of the variance in continuance
   commitment (.04). We also found significant moderating effects of age,
   work experience, and career stage on these relationships. The article
   concludes with implications for psychological contract theory,

AB Work on visual perceptual learning for contrast detection has shown that
   reliable decreases in detection thresholds are accompanied by reliable
   increases in false alarm rates (Wenger & Rasche, 2006). The present
   study assesses the robustness and replicability of these changes,
   demonstrating that they are independent of a variety of task demands
   (i.e., the specific method used for perceptual practice and threshold
   estimation) and the presence or absence of trial-by-trial feedback and
   that the source of the increases can be found in shifts in changes in
   sensitivity and in bias for detection, identification, or both. Although
   the increase in false alarm rates suggests a strategic shift in response
   criteria for detection, we demonstrate that there are multiple potential
   explanations, including explanations that do not require strategic
   shifts on the part of the observer. The empirical evidence and analysis
   of alternative explanations reinforce the inference that visual
   perceptual learning may involve more than changes in perceptual
   sensitivity and that cortical circuits beyond the primary visual areas
   may be involved.

AB INTRODUCTION: We evaluated the feasibility of using an electronic
   protocol developed for research use (Research-eProtocol-insulin) for
   blood glucose management in usual intensive care unit clinical practice.
   METHODS: We implemented the rules of Research-eProtocol-insulin in the
   electronic medical record of the Intermountain Healthcare hospital
   system (Clinical-eProtocol-insulin) for use in usual clinical practice.
   We evaluated the performance of Clinical-eProtocol-insulin rules in the
   intensive care units of seven Intermountain Healthcare hospitals and
   compared this performance with the performance of
   Research-eProtocol-insulin at the LDS Hospital Shock/Trauma/Respiratory
   Intensive Care Unit.
   RESULTS: Clinician (nurse or physician) compliance with computerized
   protocol recommendations was 95% (of 21,325 recommendations) with
   Research-eProtocol-insulin and 92% (of 109,458 recommendations) with
   Clinical-eProtocol-insulin. The blood glucose distribution in clinical
   practice (Clinical-eProtocol-insulin) was similar to the research use
   distribution (Research-eProtocol-insulin); however, the mean values (119
   mg/dl vs 113 mg/dl) were statistically different (P = 0.0001).
   Hypoglycemia rates in the research and practice settings did not differ:
   the percentage of measurements < or =40 mg/dl (0.11% vs 0.1%, P = 0.65)
   and the percentage of patients with at least one blood glucose < or =40
   mg/dl (4.2% vs 3%, P = 0.23) were not statistically significantly
   different.
   CONCLUSION: Our electronic blood glucose protocol enabled translation of
   a research decision-support tool (Research-eProtocol-insulin) to usual
   clinical practice (Clinical-eProtocol-insulin).

AB Memory is arguably the most important function of cognition. When left
   undetected, memory impairments are linked to life long underachievement
   and negative social consequences. Given that the construct of memory is
   multidimensional, the current study examined patterns of multiple
   indicators associated with memory across individuals ranging in age from
   5 to 85 years who had been administered the Wide Range Assessment of
   Memory and Learning - Second Edition (WRAML-2). Multistage cluster
   analysis with independent age replications was used to empirically
   identify normative profiles in a sample of (n = 1172) typically
   developing individuals. This procedure considered how various indicators
   of memory operate in concert by accounting for the nonlinear
   multivariate relationships among them. Results supported nine common (or
   core) profile types that satisfied all formal heuristic and statistical
   criteria, including complete coverage, satisfactory within-type
   homogeneity, between-type dissimilarity, and replicability. A summary of
   the defining characteristics for each profile is provided.

AB Tertiary or higher-order RNA motifs that regulate replication of
   positive-strand RNA viruses are as yet poorly understood. Using Japanese
   encephalitis virus (JEV), we now show that a key element in JEV RNA
   replication is a complex RNA motif that includes a string of three
   discontinuous complementary sequences (TDCS). The TDCS consists of three
   5-nt-long strands, the left (L) strand upstream of the translation
   initiator AUG adjacent to the 5'-end of the genome, and the middle (M)
   and right (R) strands corresponding to the base of the
   Flavivirus-conserved 3' stem-loop structure near the 3'-end of the RNA.
   The three strands are arranged in an antiparallel configuration, with
   two sets of base-pairing interactions creating L-M and M-R duplexes.
   Disrupting either or both of these duplex regions of TDCS completely
   abolished RNA replication, whereas reconstructing both duplex regions,
   albeit with mutated sequences, fully restored RNA replication. Modeling
   of replication-competent genomes recovered from a large pool of
   pseudorevertants originating from six replication-incompetent TDCS
   mutants suggests that both duplex base-pairing potentials of TDCS are
   required for RNA replication. in all cases, acquisition of novel
   sequences within the 3' M-R duplex facilitated a long-range RNA-RNA
   interaction of its 3'M strand with either the authentic 51 strand or its
   alternative (invariably located upstream of the 5' initiator), thereby
   restoring replicability. We also found that a TDCS homolog is conserved
   in other flaviviruses. These data suggest that two duplex base-pairings
   defined by the TDCS play an essential regulatory role in a key step(s)
   of Flavivirus RNA replication.

AB The case for replacing the binary Kraepelinian system with a continuum
   concept originated with Kraepelin [Kraepelin, E. (1920) Die

   of mental disorder. In: Themes and Variations in European Psychiatry.
   Eds S.R. Hirsch & M. Shepherd. Wright, Bristol, pp7-30, 1974).
   Zeitschrift Gesamte Neurologic Psychiatrie, vol. 62, 1-29.], and is
   based upon studies of familial aggregation and phenomenology. Craddock
   and Owen's [Craddock, N.J., Owen, M.J. (2007) Rethinking psychosis: the
   disadvantages of a dichotomous classification now outweigh the
   advantages. World Psychiatry 6: 20-27.] claim for the "beginning of the
   end for the Kraepelinian dichotomy" on the basis of linkage and
   association is undermined by un-replicability of findings across studies
   (Crow, T.J. (2007) How and why genetic linkage has not solved the
   problem of psychosis: review and hypothesis. American Journal of
   Psychiatry, 164, 13-21). Absence of evidence of linkage is consistent
   with the concept that the variation is epigerietic in form rather than
   DNA sequence-based. But what are the dimensions that underly the
   continuum? The BBC Internet survey (Peters, M., Reimers, S., Manning,
   J.T. (2006) Hand preference for writing and associations with selected
   demographic and behavioral variables in 255, 100 subjects: the BBC
   internet study. Brain and Cognition 62, 177-189), reinforces the concept
   that lateralisation is a major and sex-dependent dimension of human
   variation in verbal and spatial ability: twin studies indicate that
   inter-individual variation in dominance for language is epigenetic and
   the paternal age effect can be similarly explained. Thus an epigenetic
   imprint, arising in relation to the sapiens specific torque and
   persisting over one or two generations is a better fit to the genetics
   of the psychotic continuum than Craddock and Owen's elusive "polygenic"
   variations. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper proposes a rapid fabrication, technique of polymeric
   micro-block arrays using an IR hot embossing process. A pneumatically
   actuated embossing facility with conventional IR heating was designed,
   constructed and tested in our laboratory. To mold micro-blocks onto the
   plastic plates, a silicon mold with an array of micro-block cavities was
   fabricated by photolithography and deep reactive ion etching. During the
   embossing process, a PMMA plate was first placed above the mold. A
   ceramic IR heater was placed above the PMMA plate to heat the mold. The
   IR passed through the transparent PMMA to reach and heat up the mold
   surface. After retrieval of the IR heater, the pneumatically actuated
   embossing facility pressed the plastic plate against the hot master
   mold. A micro-block array was obtained. The effect of various processing
   parameters on the replicability of the micro-blocks was investigated.
   Under the proper processing conditions, the arrays of polymeric
   micro-blocks, with a dimension of 100 mu m x 80 mu m x 40 mu m, could be
   successfully fabricated. The experimental results in this study suggest
   that IR heated embossing could provide an affective way of fabricating
   large-area microstructures onto plastic plates. This would provide
   significant advantages in terms of a shorter cycle time as well as
   improved product quality.

AB Numerous studies have assessed side dominance assuming arm bones on the
   side of handedness will be larger, but concerns over sample size or
   replicability of measurements usually emerged. Attempting to improve
   upon these limitations, this investigation analyzes patterns of side
   difference for standard length and transverse dimensions of the scapula,
   clavicle, humerus, ulna, and radius for 137 individuals of known
   handedness. The results showed that with few exceptions, the right side
   of the skeleton was consistently larger in most individuals regardless
   of side dominance. Combinations of other measurements previously
   suggested to be indicative of handedness as well as the use of
   discriminant analysis also failed to provide reliable estimators. These
   findings are likely related to the fact that activities of modern
   individuals are generally not sufficiently unilateral in their stresses
   to cause asymmetrical development in the arm bones. Therefore, it is
   recommended that other means be developed to assess side dominance.

   findings are then compared with the quality criteria identified in the
   extant U. S. literature. Comparison reveals some shared quality criteria
   but also throws new light on a number of discrepancies. Analysis over

AB Context. To ensure interpretability and replicability of clinical
   experiments, methods must be adequately explicit and should elicit the
   same decision from different clinicians who comply with the study
   protocol.
   Objective. The objective of this study was to determine whether
   clinician compliance with protocol recommendations exceeds 90%.
   Design: We developed an adequately explicit computerized protocol
   (eProtocol-insulin) for managing critically ill adult patient blood
   glucose. We monitored clinician compliance with eProtocol-insulin
   recommendations in four intensive care units in four hospitals and
   compared blood glucose distributions with those of a simple clinical
   guideline at one hospital and a paper-based protocol at another. All
   protocols and the guideline used intravenous insulin and 80 to 110 mg/dL
   (4.4-6.1 mmol/L) blood glucose targets.
   Setting: The setting for this study was four academic hospital intensive
   care units.
   Patients. This study included critically ill adults requiring
   intravenous insulin.
   Intervention. Intervention used in this study was a bedside computerized
   protocol for managing blood glucose.
   Main Outcome Measure. The main outcome measure was clinician compliance
   with eProtocol-insulin recommendations.
   Results: The number of patients was 31 to 458 and the number of blood
   glucose measurements was 2,226 to 19,925 among the four intensive care
   units. Clinician compliance with eProtocol-insulin recommendations was
   91% to 98%. Blood glucose distributions were similar in the four
   hospitals (generalized linear model p =.18). Compared with the simple
   guideline, eProtocol-insulin glucose measurements within target
   increased from 21% to 39%, and mean blood glucose decreased from 142 to
   115 mg/dL (generalized linear model p <.001). Compared with the
   paper-based protocol, eProtocol-insulin glucose measurements within
   target increased from 28% to 42%, and mean blood glucose decreased from
   134 to 116 mg/dL (generalized linear model P =.001).
   Conclusions. The 91% to 98% clinician compliance indicates
   eProtocol-insulin is an exportable instrument that can establish a
   replicable experimental method for clinical trials of blood glucose
   management in critically ill adults. Control of blood glucose was better
   with eProtocol-insulin than with a simple clinical guideline or a
   paper-based protocol.

AB Background: Very little research has been conducted in the West to
   evaluate the clinical efficacy of Japanese acupuncture (JA). The
   characteristics that define and differentiate JA from Chinese
   acupuncture styles add specific challenges to the operationalization of
   treatment protocols for use in clinical trials.
   Objectives: To develop an ecologically valid and viable multimodal
   treatment intervention, including active and sham protocols, for use in
   a pilot randomized sham- controlled trial of a style of JA in treating
   endometriosis-related chronic pelvic pain in adolescents and young
   women.
   Methods: A focus group format was used to systematize the diagnostic
   framework, operationalize the intake, design the treatment protocols,
   and develop a viable and effective sham acupuncture intervention using
   the Streitberger device and sham moxibustion. Implementation of the
   treatment protocol employed the manualization process to provide
   flexibility of treatment while assuring replicability and
   standardization.
   Setting: The Japanese Acupuncture Department at the New England School
   of Acupuncture in Newton, MA.
   Results: Completed study visit forms indicated good compliance of study
   practitioners with active and sham treatment protocols. The specific JA
   protocols used in our pilot study were well tolerated by the adolescent
   girls who participated in the trial. No serious adverse events were
   reported by any participants. Our protocols were successful in
   maintaining patient blinding and minimizing differences in outcome
   expectations between treatment groups.
   Conclusions: Manualization provided a viable method for conforming to
   the interactive nature of JA treatments, yet facilitated compliance with
   a replicable treatment protocol. Sham controls of complex,
   multicomponent JA interventions pose unique challenges. The modified
   Streitberger needle in conjunction with sham moxibustion showed promise
   as a viable control in clinical trails of JA; both components of this
   sham protocol require further validation.

AB Background: Research in the last fifty years has shown that many
   autistic individuals have elevated serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT)
   levels in blood platelets. This phenomenon, known as the platelet
   hyperserotonemia of autism, is considered to be one of the most
   well-replicated findings in biological psychiatry. Its replicability
   suggests that many of the genes involved in autism affect a small number
   of biological networks. These networks may also play a role in the early
   development of the autistic brain.
   Results: We developed an equation that allows calculation of platelet
   5-HT concentration as a function of measurable biological parameters. It
   also provides information about the sensitivity of platelet 5- HT levels
   to each of the parameters and their interactions.
   Conclusion: The model yields platelet 5-HT concentrations that are
   consistent with values reported in experimental studies. If the
   parameters are considered independent, the model predicts that platelet
   5-HT levels should be sensitive to changes in the platelet 5-HT uptake
   rate constant, the proportion of free 5-HT cleared in the liver and
   lungs, the gut 5-HT production rate and its regulation, and the volume
   of the gut wall. Linear and non-linear interactions among these and
   other parameters are specified in the equation, which may facilitate the
   design and interpretation of experimental studies.

AB This commentary reviews and comments on six major longitudinal studies
   from the United States, Great Britain and Finland, that test predictive
   models of drinking and problem drinking behavior across a developmental
   span of one to two generations. The large Ns, in two instances involving
   population samples, and the broad and study-overlapping variable domains
   make this collection of studies unique and of special interest vis-a-vis
   the issue of cross-study replicability of findings. Significant
   cross-study commonalities are noted, involving the strong cross-study
   replicability of an undercontrol/externalizing domain as both a
   childhood and adolescent predictor of problem drinking outcomes in early
   to middle adulthood, the relative autostability of heavy and problem use
   of alcohol over intervals of time as long as a generation, the utility
   of early drinking behavior as an index for later drinking outcomes, the
   relative parallelism (with some exceptions) of male and female findings,
   albeit with greater predictability of male over female drinking outcomes
   and the relatively tighter relational networks of drinking and other
   behavioral characteristics for males. This impressive group of
   quasi-replications also points the field to address several next-step
   questions, including: (i) the need to parse the
   undercontrol/externalizing domain to identify those subcomponential
   process characteristics that are causal to heavy and problem drinking
   outcomes; (ii) the need to develop models that will handle more
   effectively the uneven relationships of negative activity to drinking
   outcomes, in some instances operating protectively, in other instances
   operating as risk factors; (iii) the need for more carefully
   articulated, theoretically driven process models that will specify the
   ordering, developmental saliency and mediational properties of risk and
   protective factors as they come on line; and (iv) the need for more
   developmental testing of trait/context interaction models of problem
   drinking development.

AB OBJECTIVE
   To test the replicability and robustness of findings about urological
   symptoms in men and women, classified using an objective statistical
   method, cluster analysis, by planned sensitivity analyses conducted
   within and across two large, epidemiological studies of lower urinary
   tract symptoms.
   METHODS
   Sensitivity analyses were used to assess the effects of: (i) the number
   of urological symptoms included in the cluster analysis; (ii) the use of
   ordinal vs dichotomous scaling of responses; (iii) the type of cluster
   analysis used (hierarchical vs non-hierarchical; random vs nonrandom
   seeds); and (iv) the distance metric (median difference vs root mean
   square) of the resulting clusters. These sensitivity analyses were
   conducted independently in each of the two studies, with results
   systematically compared using Cramer's V statistic. Contingency tables
   were also used to assess the frequency of transitions or change in
   classification from one method to another.
   RESULTS
   There were marked similarities in the cluster profiles in men and women
   across the two studies. For both men and women, the largest clusters
   consisted of low-frequency, single-symptom profiles, with urinary
   frequency and urgency symptoms reported by both genders. There was a
   multiple, mixed and highly symptomatic cluster profile in both genders
   in the Boston Area Community Health (BACH) and EPIC studies. The
   sensitivity analyses showed stability across both BACH and EPIC studies,
   and varying cluster methods and solutions (Cramer's V, 0.37-0.93).
   CONCLUSION
   Sensitivity analyses show that cluster profiles are quite robust from
   EPIC to BACH, and that gender profiles within studies are relatively
   consistent across the methods and variables examined. Further studies
   are needed to investigate the mechanisms of action and clinical
   management implications of these findings.

AB The aim of the present studies was to generate implicit theories of a
   desire for fame among the general population. In Study 1, we were able
   to develop a nine-factor analytic model of conceptions of the desire to
   be famous that initially comprised nine separate factors; ambition,
   meaning derived through comparison with others, psychologically
   vulnerable, attention seeking, conceitedness, social access, altruistic,
   positive affect, and glamour. Analysis that sought to examine
   replicability among these factors suggested that three factors
   (altruistic, positive affect, and glamour) neither display factor
   congruence nor display adequate internal reliability. A second study
   examined the validity of these factors in predicting profiles of
   individuals who may desire fame. The findings from this study suggested
   that two of the nine factors (positive affect and altruism) could not be
   considered strong factors within the model. Overall, the findings
   suggest that implicit theories of a desire for fame comprise six
   factors. The discussion focuses on how an implicit model of a desire for
   fame might progress into formal theories of a desire for fame.

AB In recent years, numerous physical anthropologists have pointed out the
   need for regional standards for estimating age in various world
   populations. While investigating aging methods for East European
   populations, dramatic changes were noted in the pubic symphyseal
   morphology and structure of older adult female individuals. These
   changes were not captured in the typically used pubic symphysis aging
   methods. This paper defines and tests the need for a new phase, phase
   VII, that follows the Suchey-Brooks phase VI. In addition, Suchey-Brooks
   phases V and VI are redefined. Phase definitions, decision-making rules,
   and comparison graphics for the new method are presented. Balkan (n =
   85) and Eastern Tennessee (n = 104) samples, totaling 189 individuals,
   were used in the analysis. Pearson correlation coefficients between four
   observers and a control seriation were strong, indicating ease of
   replicability between investigators. No statistically significant
   intra-observer error was detected. Summary statistics show that
   individuals in phase V were on average in the early 50s, while
   individuals in phase VI were in their mid 50s to mid 60s, and
   individuals in phase VII were in their mid 70s. Since linear regression
   models tend to under-age the elderly and over-age the young, transition
   analysis, using an unrestricted cumulative probit model, was undertaken
   to evaluate the phases and to produce point estimates for the
   ages-at-transition for the Balkan sample. The highest posterior density
   region point estimates with their associated upper and lower bounds can
   be used for predicting age for unknown forensic cases related to the
   Balkan sample. Further, the mean ages and standard deviations for phases
   V-VII for the Tennessee sample are presented for use in American
   forensic cases.

   replicability in resource-limited settings are limited. A warmline was
   established in Rakai, Uganda, to support an antiretroviral therapy
   program. Over a 17-month period, a database was kept of who called, why
   they called, and the result of the call. A program evaluation was also
   administered to clinical staff. A total of 1303 calls (3.5 calls per
   weekday) were logged. The warmline was used mostly by field staff and
   peripherally based peer health workers. Calls addressed important
   clinical issues, including the need for urgent care, medication side
   effects, and follow-up needs. Most clinical staff felt that the warmline
   made their jobs easier and improved the health of patients. An HIV/AIDS
   warmline leveraged the skills of a limited workforce to provide

AB Background
   In a recent preliminary trial in 20 patients after gastric bypass
   Surgery, 20 minutes of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
   (TMS) over the left prefrontal cortex was associated with a 40%
   reduction in postoperative patient-controlled morphine use. As is the
   case with all novel scientific findings, and especially those that might
   have an impact on clinical practice, replicability is paramount. This
   study sought to test this finding for replication and to more accurately
   estimate the effect size of this brief intervention on postoperative
   morphine use and postoperative pain and mood ratings.
   Methods
   Twenty participants who underwent gastric bypass surgery completed this
   replication and extension C study. Beck Depression Inventory and Center
   for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale scores were collected befor
   surgery and at the time of discharge from the hospital. Immediately
   after surgery, participants were randomly assigned to receive 20 minutes
   of real or sham repetitive TMS (rTMS) (10 Hz, 10 seconds-ON, 20
   seconds-OFF for a total of 4000 Pulses). Patient-controlled morphine
   pump usage was tracked throughout each participant's postoperative
   hospital stay. In addition, pain and inood I ratings were collected via
   Visual analogue scales twice per day.
   Results
   Findings from the original postoperative TMS trial were replicated, as
   cumulative morphine usage curves were significantly steeper among
   patients receiving sham TMS, and participants receiving real TMS had
   used 35% less morphine at the time of discharge than participants
   receiving sham TMS. At the time of discharge. subjects who had received
   real TMS had used 42.50 mg of morphine, whereas subjects receiving sham
   TMS had used an average of 64.88 mg. When the data from the original
   preliminary trial were combined with the data from this replication
   trial, a significant difference in cumulative morphine usage was
   observed between Subjects receiving real and sham TMS. Overall,
   participants who received real TMS used 36% less morphine and had
   significantly lower ratings of postoperative pain-on-average. and
   pain-at-its-worst than participants receiving sham. In addition,
   participants who received real TMS rated their mood-at-its-worst as
   significantly better than participants receiving sham. The effect of it
   single 20-minute session of TMS on postoperative pain and morphine use
   appears to be large (Cohen's d = 0.70) and clinically meaningful,
   Lastly, cross-lag Correlational analyses indicate that improvements in
   inood follow improvements in pain by approximately hours, supporting the
   notion that postoperative analgesic TMS effects are not driven by
   antidepressant effects.
   Conclusions
   Although more research is needed to verify these observed effects
   independently, findings from the original postoperative TMS trial were
   replicated. TMS may have the potential to significantly improve current
   standards of postoperative care among gastric bypass patients. and
   further Studies may be warranted on other surgical populations. Future
   investigations should use methodology that permits more definitive
   Conclusions about Causal effects of TMS on postoperative pain (for
   example, double-linding. Sham Stimulation that is matched with real TMS
   with respect to scalp discomfort). (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB Background: Our aim was to study the psychometrics and factor structure
   replicability of the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and
   San Diego Autoquestionnaire (TEMPS-A) in its Italian (Rome) Version. The
   questionnaire is a self-report 110-item measure that postulates five
   affective temperaments-the depressive, cyclothymic, irritable,
   hyperthymic, and anxiouswhich embody both strengths and liabilities
   along affective reactivity. In Italian, the TEMPS has previously been
   validated in its original 32-item version, the TEMPS-I (Pisa), one which
   did not yet include an anxious subscale. Methods: The present sample
   consisted of 948 tionclinical subjects (27.39 years 8.22 S.D.). There
   were 476 men (50.2%: 28.56 years 8.63 S.D.) and 472 women (49.8%: 26.21
   years +/- 7.61 S.D.). Reliability and validity were assessed by standard
   psychometric tests. Results: Principal Components Analysis with Varimax
   rotation resulted in a 3-factor solution: the first with highest
   explained variance (8.84%) represents Dysthymic, Cyclothymic and Anxious
   (Dys-Cyc-Anx) temperaments combined; the second identifies Irritable
   temperament (5.65% of variance); and the third Hyperthymic temperament
   (5.16% of variance). Cronbach Alpha coefficients for the three subscales
   were respectively.89,.77 and.74. The rates for the Dys-Cyc-Anx were
   2.7%, and for the Irritable 3.1%. Despite the low rate of the
   Hyperthymic temperament (.2%), nonetheless 16% were between Ist and 2nd
   SD. Exploratory factor analysis revealed a positive loading combining
   Dys-Cyc-Anx with the Irritable; the Hyperthymic loaded negatively on
   this factor. In terms of dominant temperaments, based on z-scores, 2.7%
   were dysthymic, 1.7% cyclothymic,.7% hyperthymic, 3.5% irritable and 3%
   anxious. Limitation: Although developed for self-rated use, the Italian
   authors nonetheless administered the TEMPS-A in an interview format. It
   is uncertain in what ways this procedure could have influenced our
   results, if any. Another limitation is that we did not assess
   test-retest reliability. Conclusions: These data,identify at least
   3-factors, Dys-Cyc-Anx and Irritable (which are correlated), and
   Hyperthymic, which is uncorrelated with the others. Though our data are
   reminiscent of the neuroticism-extraversion distinction, importantly
   traits are operationalized in affective terms. Beyond the well-known
   relationship between the Dysthymic and Cyclothymic subscales and that
   between the Dysthymic and Anxious, the present data reveal a strong
   relationship between the Cyclothymic and Anxious as well, which is of
   great relevance for bipolar II. It is also provocative that much of
   hyperthymia (16%) in the + SD is between the 1st and 2nd SD, thereby
   "normalizing" this temperament in Italy, as previously reported by
   TEMPS-I (Pisa) from Northern Italy (and TEMPS-A from Lebanon and
   Argentina). (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Continuous arterial spin labeling (CASL) magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) was combined with multivariate analysis for detection of an
   Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related cerebral blood flow (CBF) covariance
   pattern. Whole-brain resting CBF maps were obtained using spin echo,
   echo planar imaging (SE-EPI) CASL in patients with mild AD (n = 12, age
   = 70.7 +/- 8.7 years, 7 males, modified Mini-Mental State Examination
   (mMMS) = 38.7/57 +/- 11.1) and age-matched healthy controls (HC) (n =
   20; age = 72.1 +/- 6.5 years, 8 males). A covariance pattern for which
   the mean expression was significantly higher (P < 0.0005) in AD than in
   HC was identified containing posterior cingulate, superior temporal,
   parahippocampal, and fusiform gyri, as well as thalamus, insula, and
   hippocampus. The results from this analysis were supplemented with those
   from the more standard, region of interest (ROI) and voxelwise,
   univariate techniques. All ROIs (17/hemisphere) showed significant
   decrease in CBF in AD (P < 0.001 for all ROIs, alpha(corrected) = 0.05).
   The area under the ROC curve for discriminating AD versus HC was 0.97
   and 0.94 for covariance pattern and gray matter ROI, respectively. Fewer
   areas of depressed CBF in AD were detected using voxelwise analysis
   (corrected, P < 0.05). These areas were superior temporal, cingulate,
   middle temporal, fusiform gyri, as well as inferior parietal lobule and
   precuneus. When tested on extensive split-half analysis to map out the
   replicability of both multivariate and univariate approaches, the
   expression of the pattern from multivariate analysis was superior to
   that of the univariate.

AB Reporting p values from statistical significance tests is common in
   psychology's empirical literature. Sir Ronald Fisher saw the p value as
   playing a useful role in knowledge development by acting as an
   'objective' measure of inductive evidence against the null hypothesis.
   We review several reasons why the p value is an unobjective and
   inadequate measure of evidence when statistically testing hypotheses. A
   common theme throughout many of these reasons is that p values
   exaggerate the evidence against H(0). This, in turn, calls into question
   the validity of much published work based on comparatively small,
   including.05, p values. Indeed, if researchers were fully informed about
   the limitations of the p value as a measure of evidence, this
   inferential index could not possibly enjoy its ongoing ubiquity.
   Replication with extension research focusing on sample statistics,
   effect sizes, and their confidence intervals is a better vehicle for
   reliable knowledge development than using p values. Fisher would also
   have agreed with the need for replication research.

AB Background: Most experimental and assessment tasks in studies of
   neurogenic language disorders rely on visual information processing.
   Given that many patients with such disorders have visual deficits,
   failure to describe and/or control for visual function may lead to
   invalid data collection and interpretation. A review of literature on
   participant description in aphasia research indicates a clear need for
   improvement in the description of and control for visual acuity, colour
   perception, visual fields, visual attention, and ocular motor functions.
   Few authors control for or describe even basic aspects of vision.
   Aims: Strategic design of visual screening protocols is advocated.
   Appropriate selection of screening methods depends on specific
   assessment and experimental tasks to be administered in a given study.
   Researchers are encouraged to implement, and to describe in published
   reports, specific procedures to address visual acuity, colour
   perception, visual fields, visual attention, and ocular motor functions.
   Main Contribution: Visual characteristics are presented within a
   framework of (1) those that may be evaluated as part of a case history
   and (2) those that may be directly screened by experimenters or assessed
   by collaborating professionals. Recommended screening procedures, and
   their relevance to various assessment and experimental tasks, are
   described to assist researchers in strategically designing visual
   assessment protocols for future studies involving individuals with
   aphasia and related disorders.
   Conclusions: Improved assessment of visual function will improve the
   validity, quality, and replicability of research as well as readers'
   interpretations of published data and authors' conclusions. Formative
   feedback concerning appropriate participant control and description is
   critical for improving the peer review process for research publication
   and funding. As training in visual assessment is not central to the
   training of most researchers in neurogenic communication disorders,
   further focus on this important issue within graduate programmes and
   continuing education curricula is needed.

   component can add value to otherwise audio-only clips. Subjects rated
   clips used in published CD-ROMs and how much they remembered was also
   tested. In one set of clips, the visual component was removed, in a
   second the audio was removed and a third set was unedited. The
   experiment was run three times, on different groups, to check
   replicability. For all groups, clips with a visual component as well as
   audio were judged to contain more information and to be more interesting
   than audio-only clips. There was also some evidence that the visual
   component can increase subjects' confidence in what they can remember.
   Other expected effects were not observed in every group in which they
   were tested. It is speculated that training in media literacy may help
   developers to use the visual component more effectively.

TI Honey as a topical treatment for wounds

PY 2008
AB Background
   Honey is a viscous, supersaturated sugar solution derived from nectar
   gathered and modified by the honeybee, Apis mellifera. Honey has been
   used since ancient times as a remedy in wound care. Evidence from animal
   studies and some trials has suggested honey may accelerate wound
   healing.
   Objectives
   The objective was to determine whether honey increases the rate of
   healing in acute wounds ( burns, lacerations and other traumatic wounds)
   and chronic wounds ( venous ulcers, arterial ulcers, diabetic ulcers,
   pressure ulcers, infected surgical wounds).
   Search strategy
   We searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register ( May 2008),
   CENTRAL ( May 2008) and several other electronic databases ( May 2008).
   Bibliographies were searched and manufacturers of dressing products were
   contacted for unpublished trials.
   Selection criteria
   Randomised and quasi randomised trials that evaluated honey as a
   treatment for any sort of acute or chronic wound were sought. There was
   no restriction in terms of source, date of publication or language.
   Wound healing was the primary endpoint.
   Data collection and analysis
   Data from eligible trials were extracted and summarised using a data
   extraction sheet by one author and independently verified by a second
   author.
   Main results
   19 trials ( n = 2554) were identified that met the inclusion criteria.
   In acute wounds, three trials evaluated the effect of honey in acute
   lacerations, abrasions or minor surgical wounds and nine trials
   evaluated the effect the honey in burns. In chronic wounds two trials
   evaluated the effect of honey in venous leg ulcers and one trial in
   pressure ulcers, infected post- operative wounds, and Fournier's
   gangrene respectively. Two trials recruited people with mixed groups of
   chronic or acute wounds. The poor quality of most of the trial reports
   means the results should be interpreted with caution, except in venous
   leg ulcers. In acute wounds, honey may reduce time to healing compared
   with some conventional dressings in partial thickness burns ( WMD - 4.68
   days, 95% CI - 4.28 to - 5.09 days). All the included burns trials have
   originated from a single centre, which may have impact on replicability.
   In chronic wounds, honey in addition to compression bandaging does not
   significantly increase healing in venous leg ulcers ( RR 1.15, 95% CI
   0.96 to 1.38). There is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of
   honey compared with other treatments for burns or in other acute or
   chronic wound types.
   Authors' conclusions
   Honey may improve healing times in mild to moderate superficial and
   partial thickness burns compared with some conventional dressings. Honey
   dressings as an adjuvant to compression do not significantly increase
   leg ulcer healing at 12 weeks. There is insufficient evidence to guide
   clinical practice in other areas.

AB This paper presents a new supporting tool for distant collaborative
   design, named SketSha. This prototype supports the early stages of
   design and more particularly the initial and crucial step of free-hand
   sketching. SketSha and its particular interface, named the virtual
   desktop, aim to keep from Front-To-Front collaborative work all the
   benefits and to appoint to them some of the nowadays IT facilities, in
   order to manage in a realistic and efficient way a long distance
   collaboration and to effectively serve the designers' needs. Our hope is
   to re-introduce the social aspects and group interactions, crucial for
   real system efficacy and adaptation to the business world. The paper
   presents the fundamental assumptions made to implement SketSha, that are
   questioned and analyzed through a real-size experimentation featuring 30
   architecture and building engineering students, working together in
   real-time in different locations (Belgium and France). This experiment
   and the necessary survey open up interesting fields of investigations,
   such as the relevance of the sketch stage and the proposed device to
   support distant collaborative design in architecture and the benefit it
   represents for students, in a pedagogical point of view, to merge the IT
   aspects and the design studio. The methodology and the replicability are
   analyzed to increase the level and quality of our students' formation
   and, finally, a critic of SketSha constitutes a benefit for the
   developing teams.

   the Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire (ZKPQ) at the factor-
   and at the facet-level. The ZKPQ is an instrument aimed at assessing the
   five basic factors of Zuckerman's Alternative Five-Factor Model (AFFM).
   Subjects were 843 French-speaking Swiss, mainly students. At the
   factor-level, the reliability ranged from .73 to.87 and at the facet
   level, the reliability ranged from .57 to .77. Differences between
   genders are congruent with those found in the American sample. Women
   scored higher on N-Anx, and lower on ImpSS, and Act. A series of
   exploratory factor analyses supported the overall five-factor structure
   and the structure at the facet-level. The correlations among the scales
   support that the five basic factors of the AFFM are orthogonal. Targeted
   factor analyses and congruence coefficients show high cross-language
   replicability at the factor- and at the facet-level. The adequacy of the
   model at the factor- and facet-level was tested using confirmatory
   factor analyses. The results show that the French version of the ZKPQ is
   a reliable and valid instrument and has a high cross-language
   replicability.

PD 2008

AB This paper aims to argue that private equity funds play a critical role
   in the Korean economy and that their presence, now and in the future is
   essential. Moreover, domestic private equity funds will be complementary
   to foreign private equity funds, not a substitute, at least for the time
   being. In arguing so, we will look into the investment experiences of
   foreign private equity funds and see how foreign private equity funds
   have helped transform the economy in the post-financial crisis era. We
   will also look at the domestic private equity funds market to examine
   the replicability of private equity-driven growth in Korea. The paper
   will conclude with further recommendations for the growth of the private
   equity market. In the past five years or so, Koreans have come to be
   familiar with names such as Carlyle, Newbridge Capital, Lone Star, etc.
   These are the names of major foreign institutional investment firms that
   bought out the Korean domestic banks, Koram Bank, Korea First Bank, and
   Korea Exchange Bank. Recently, with the incident of the Lone Star
   scandal disclosed in regards to its acquisition of Korea First Bank, the
   Korean media have given extensive coverage to the issues relating to
   private equity funds. Especially after the scandals involving foreign
   investors, there is public discontent about the large volume of foreign
   private equity funds, mainly in the financial sector, that seem to 'eat
   and run' once increased profits have been made. People have scrutinized
   investments of this kind with critical eyes.  Nevertheless, we should
   acknowledge the contributions that the foreign private equity funds have
   played in various sectors of the economy in the post-crisis period.
   Foreign funds have invested in troubled Korean firms, understanding any
   risks involved, and successfully turned them around for the better. To
   that end, even if domestic private equity funds that have been set up
   since 2004 have not yet performed to the market expectation, we have to
   understand that they have further roles to play as we anticipate growth
   of the M&A market in the coming years.

   between lysosomal destabilization and body residues of multiple PAHs in
   eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) exposed to a mixture of PAHs for
   25 days in laboratory aquariums. The contaminated oysters were then
   placed in clean aquariums for 20 days to allow them to depurate and
   recover. The lysosomal destabilization was linearly correlated with the
   PAH body burdens. Regression analysis showed that critical body residue
   (CBR), in terms of lysosomal destabilization (at least 50% of
   destabilized cells), was found at 2,100 ng/g (9.32 nmol/g) of total
   PAHs. This CBR is much lower than the CBRs for reproduction and death,
   confirming that lysosomal destabilization, as a cellular level
   biomarker, appears to be functioning as an early warning indicator that
   can be used to detect aquatic contamination much before severe effects
   are observed. During 25 days of exposure, the lysosomal destabilization
   and PAH body burdens increased from 32 to 75% and 77 to 5,925 ng/g,
   respectively. After 20 days of elimination period, the lysosomal
   destabilization and PAH body burdens decreased to 49% and 2,350 ng/g,
   respectively. Uptake rates of PAHs showed parabolic shaped correlation
   with hydrophobicity (K-ow). Uptake rate constants of more hydrophobic
   PAHs (log K-ow > 4.6) had a negative correlation with K-ow, implying
   that hydrophobicity alone is not a satisfactory predictor for these
   PAHs. Elimination half-lives varied from 4 to 96 days and
   bioconcentration factors ranged from 650 to 160,000. Fugacity ratios
   (f(o)/f(w)) indicated that equilibrium still was not reached at the end
   of the uptake period. Data obtained from the three replicate aquariums,
   which were operated at the same time under the same condition, showed
   good replicability (RPD < 30%).

AB Objective To investigate children intelligence and analyze its

   preschool children. Methods Three hundred and forty-five senior
   kindergarten children (191 boys and 154 girls) coming from three
   kindergartens in Jintan were selected to participate in the study.
   Intelligence was measured by intelligence quotient (IQ) using the WPPSI.
   Results The mean scores of children IQ in three kindergartens were
   (101.80 +/- 11.88). There were no gender differences in full
   intelligence quotient (FIQ) (P>0.05), and verbal intelligence quotient
   (VIQ) in both male and female children: were significantly lower than
   their Performance intelligence quotient (PIQ) (P<0.01). The percent of
   IQ disassociation was 28.70% in the children, with 69.70% of the
   children had VIQ lower than PIQ, the IQ disassociation children did not
   differ from other children in terms of FIQ ((P>0.05). There was no
   obvious trend in the analysis of the intelligent ability scatter model.
   However, the scatter scores of the verbal intelligence subscale were
   lower than that of performance Intelligence subscale (P=0.000).
   Conclusions Children in this cohort had relatively inferior VIQ. Further
   studies should be conducted to assess replicability of this finding and
   test the following competing hypotheses: (1) increasing access to
   educational materials selectively enhances performance ability, or (2)
   the 1980s WPPSI for Chinese children is. in need of revision in order to
   get with the new times. In addition, this cohort's intelligent ability
   scatter model is worthwhile for follow-up study.

PD 2008
PY 2008
AB Genomewide association scan (GWAS) data mining has found moderate-effect
   "gold nugget" complex trait genes. But for many traits, much of the
   explanatory variance may be truly polygenic, more like gold dust, whose
   small marginal effects are undetectable by traditional methods. Yet,
   their collective effects may be quite important in advancing
   personalized medicine. We consider a novel approach to sift out the
   genetic gold dust influencing quantitative (or qualitative) traits. Out
   of a GWAS, we randomly grab handfuls of SNPs, modeling their effects in
   a multiple linear (or logistic) regression. The model's significance is
   used to obtain an iteratively updated pseudo-Bayesian posterior
   probability associated with each SNP, which is repeated over many random
   draws until the distribution becomes stable. A stepwise procedure culls
   the list of SNPs to define the final set. Results from a benchmark
   simulation of 5 quantitative trait genes among 1,000, in 1,000 random
   subjects, are contrasted with marginal tests using nominal significance,
   Bonferroni-corrected significance, false discovery rates, as well as
   with serial selection methods. Random handfuls produced the best
   combination of sensitivity (0.95) specificity (0.99) and true positive
   rate (0.71) of all methods tested and better replicability in an
   independent subject set. From more extensive simulations, we determine
   which combinations of signal to noise ratios, SNP typing densities, and
   sample sizes are tractable with which methods to gather the gold dust.

AB BACKGROUND: Population-based rates of adult vaccinations and cancer
   screenings are low, with less than 40% of older adults up to date with
   routinely recommended prevention services. Delivery rates are lower
   still in poor and minority communities.
   CONTEXT: During the past 10 years, Sickness Prevention Achieved through
   Regional Collaboration (SPARC), a New England-based nonprofit agency,
   has developed a promising model for increasing community-wide delivery
   of prevention services. However, the SPARC model has not been tested in
   communities elsewhere. In 2006, the Centers for Disease Control and
   Prevention facilitated a partnership between SPARC and the Aging
   Services division of the Atlanta Regional Commission to evaluate the
   program's replicability.
   METHODS: SPARC coalitions involving local public health agencies,
   hospitals, social service organizations, and advocacy groups were
   established in two counties of the region, with the Atlanta Regional
   Commission providing regional coordination. Using the SPARC model, the
   coalitions planned, marketed, and implemented community-based activities
   to deliver adult screenings and vaccinations.
   CONSEQUENCES: During a 3-week pilot phase, SPARC clinics were held in
   central Atlanta at three senior housing facilities, a local fire
   station, and a charter middle school, delivering 353 prevention services
   to 314 residents. In Fayette County, 634 people received influenza
   vaccinations on Election Day at SPARC clinics located near 10 polling
   places.
   INTERPRETATION: The SPARC model provides a practical framework for
   improving the community-wide delivery of disease prevention services.
   The model can galvanize local health services providers to develop
   successful locally tailored interventions, and the approach is
   applicable in communities outside of SPARC's home region.

AB Uncertainty is an integral component in thematic mapping, and
   descriptors such as percent correctly classified pixels (PCC) and Kappa
   coefficients of agreement have been devised as thematic accuracy
   metrics. However, such spatially averaged measures neither offer hints
   about spatial variation in accuracy, nor are they useful for error
   propagation in derivatives due to the deficiency that spatial dependency
   is not properly accommodated. Geostatistics provides a good framework
   for spatial uncertainty characterization, as conditional simulation is
   designed for generating equal-probable realizations of often sparsely
   sampled fields of concern, which can be summarized for error statistics
   or subjected to particular geo-processing to facilitate error
   propagation. Often, for modeling errors in area-class maps depicting
   distributions of spatial classes, stochastic indicator simulation is
   employed. Unfortunately, indicator approaches suffer from non-invariant
   behaviors in simulated classes as class labels are drawn from intervals
   of class probabilities that are arbitrarily ordered. Discriminant
   space-based models have been proposed to enhance consistency in mapping
   spatial classes and replicability in modeling spatial categorical
   uncertainty. This paper explores bivariate (rather than univariate)
   discriminant models and extends uncertainty modeling from single-time to
   bi-temporal area-class maps. Experiment using simulated data sets was
   carried out to quantify errors in area classes and their propagation in
   change analysis. It was found that there are significant differences
   between the results obtained by discriminant models and those by
   indicator geostatistics. Further investigations are anticipated
   incorporating real data for mapping and propagating errors in area
   classes.

AB Pre-imbibition treatments and hydro-priming can enhance germination
   performance. In earlier studies, enhancement of  P. multijuga seed
   germination was only observed after short periods of submersion in water
   and the lack of sufficient aeration was pointed out to be a possible
   cause. With the aim to improve the method, seed imbibition by submersion
   in water, aerated with an aquarium pump, was compared with seed
   imbibition between moist cloths. In both methods different levels of
   seed imbibition were established at 15°C. Before sowing in moist
   vermiculite, the seeds were air dried (25°C) for seven days. Submersed
   in water, seeds imbibed faster than between moist clothes, and
   replicability of the imbibition curve was better with submersion.
   Without pre-imbibition germination was 75%. With pre-imbibition of about
   40% of seed moisture content (MC), 83% germination was assessed with
   seed submersion method (3 d) and 92% germination with the moist cloths
   method (6 d). The performance was downgraded with the submersion method
   when MC was ≥50%. Pre-imbibition between moist cloths showed statistical
   higher results than the control, indicating the importance of adequate
   aeration during imbibition, confirming also earlier findings that slight
   imbibition can improve  P. multijuga seed germination. However the
   difficulty to get replicable imbibition levels with this method points
   out the necessity for further improvement.

   applicants who had applied for jobs in the SAPS (N = 1535), and the SAS
   was administered to them. An exploratory factor analysis utilising
   target rotation applied to all 60 items of the SAS revealed four
   interpretable factors (Social Cynicism, Reward for Application, Fate
   Control, and Spirituality/Religiosity). Values of Tucker's phi higher
   than 0,90 were found for seven language groups (Zulu, Sotho, Tswana,
   Swati, Tsonga, Venda and Pedi). Analyses of variance found that item
   bias was not a major disturbance. Unacceptable alpha values were found
   for some of the scales of the SAS.

AB The NEO-PI-R is one of the most widely used and researched
   operationalisations of the Five Factor model (FFM) of personality
   (McCrae & Allik, 2002, McCrae & Terraccianno, 2005). Considerable
   evidence exists in terms of its replicability across cultures leading
   researchers to conclude that the NEO-PI-R and by extension the FFM are
   universally applicable. This paper, by virtue of reviewing appropriate
   literature, argues that evidence for the structural equivalence of the
   NEO-PI-R, while appropriate in Western cultures, is lacking in
   non-Western, and specifically African cultures. This is discussed with
   particular reference to the existence of other factors which are not
   tapped by this model and which would merit further research.

AB Two hundred and five (103 female and 102 male) children enrolled in
   school years 1 and 2 in the UK (mean age 6 years 1 month at Time 1) were
   tested twice over a 1-year period. The children reported the promise
   keeping and secret keeping behaviours of classmates (all peers and
   same-gender peers) and provided friendship nominations (Time 2 only).
   Round robin social relations analyses for all peers and same-gender
   peers revealed: (1) perceiver variance, demonstrating consistent
   individual differences in trust beliefs in peers; (2) target variance,
   demonstrating consistent individual differences in eliciting trust from
   peers; and, (3) dyadic reciprocity, demonstrating reciprocal trust
   between individuals. Replicability across measures, stability, and
   cross-measure stability of these effects were found for all peers only.
   As hypothesized, the perceiver and target effects of trust were
   associated with the number of friendships. The findings support the
   conclusion that young children demonstrate multiple components of trust
   in dyadic relationships, which are associated with their social
   relationships.

PY 2007
AB OBJECTIVES: To assess the evidence that three marketed gene
   expression-based assays improve prognostic accuracy, treatment choice,
   and health outcomes in women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer.
   REVIEW METHODS: We evaluated the evidence for three gene expression
   assays on the market; Oncotype DX, MammaPrint and the Breast Cancer
   Profiling (BCP or H/I ratio) test, and for gene expression signatures
   underlying the assays. We sought evidence on: analytic performance of
   tests, clinical validity (i.e., prognostic accuracy and discrimination),
   clinical utility (i.e., prediction of treatment benefit), harms, impact
   on clinical decision making and health care costs.
   RESULTS: Few papers were found on the analytic validity of the Oncotype
   DX and MammaPrint tests, but these showed reasonable within-laboratory
   replicability. Pre-analytic issues related to sample storage and
   preparation may play a larger role than within-laboratory variation. For
   clinical validity, studies differed according to whether they examined
   the actual test that is currently being offered to patients or the
   underlying gene signature. Almost all of the Oncotype DX evidence was
   for the marketed test, the strongest validation study being from one arm
   of a randomized controlled trial (NSABP-14) with a clinically
   homogeneous population. This study showed that the test, added in a
   clinically meaningful manner to standard prognostic indices. The
   MammaPrint signature and test itself was examined in studies with
   clinically heterogeneous populations (e.g., mix of ER positivity and
   tamoxifen treatment) and showed a clinically relevant separation of
   patients into risk categories, but it was not clear exactly how many
   predictions would be shifted across decision thresholds if this were
   used in combination with traditional indices. The BCP test itself was
   examined in one study, and the signature was tested in a variety of
   formulations in several studies. One randomized controlled trial
   provided high quality retrospective evidence of the clinical utility of
   Oncotype DX to predict chemotherapy treatment benefit, but evidence for
   clinical utility was not found for MammaPrint or the H/I ratio. Three
   decision analyses examined the cost-effectiveness of breast cancer gene
   expression assays, and overall were inconclusive.
   CONCLUSIONS: Oncotype DX is furthest along the validation pathway, with
   strong retrospective evidence that it predicts distant spread and
   chemotherapy benefit to a clinically relevant extent over standard
   predictors, in a well-defined clinical subgroup with clear treatment
   implications. The evidence for clinical implications of using MammaPrint
   was not as clear as with Oncotype DX, and the ability to predict
   chemotherapy benefit does not yet exist. The H/I ratio test requires
   further validation. For all tests, the relationship of predicted to
   observed risk in different populations still needs further study, as
   does their incremental contribution, optimal implementation, and
   relevance to patients on current therapies.

AB 1. The replicability of mesocosms is assessed in a case study of
   artificial streams (4 m(2)) flanking a lowland chalk river in southern
   U.K. Among-mesocosm comparisons of physicochemistry and
   macroinvertebrate assemblage composition (in drift and benthos) were
   made during a 2-year survey of 12 outdoor once-through linear channels.
   2. Mesocosm physicochemistry was highly replicable, with statistically
   significant congruence in temporal variation across the mesocosm series,
   low spatial variation and no significant blocking or positional effects
   arising from mesocosm layout. Parallel physicochemistry was attributed
   to the outdoor stream-side location and short water residence times.
   3. Mesocosms were colonized by 127 macroinvertebrate taxa from 15
   taxonomic orders. Both benthic and drifting assemblages were comparable
   among mesocosms, with no significant effect of mesocosm layout. Small
   differences in taxonomic composition were, however, evident among
   particular mesocosms, with higher (e.g. Tinodes, Limnius and Elmis) or
   lower (e.g. Pisidium and Valvata) abundances observed for a minority
   (5%) of taxa. We conclude that large (4 m(2)) outdoor flow - through
   mesocosms can be replicable when located near to the source system and
   allowed to establish naturally.

   predicted the most effective reports of social problem-solving abilities

AB The Distressed personality type, identified in a cardiac population,
   confers risk for worse cardiac outcomes. Whether such a class of persons
   is identifiable in general patient populations, as well as its health
   correlates, remains unknown. We investigated these questions in a sample
   of 482 older primary care patients. Mixture structural equation
   modelling revealed that a Distressed Type was identifiable in Five
   Factor Model (FFM) personality data and associated with higher levels of
   medically documented multimorbidity, and worse subjective health
   ratings, physician assessed physical functioning and interviewer rated
   psychosocial functioning. In models including paths from outcomes to
   both traits and types, traits and types were independently associated
   with health outcomes, pointing towards the value of considering both
   approaches in epidemiologic personology research. Copyright (C) 2007

AB Functional telomeres are required for the replicability of cancer cells.
   The G-rich strand of telomeric DNA can fold into a 4-stranded structure
   known as the G-quadruplex (G4), whose stabilization alters telomere
   function limiting cancer cell growth. Therefore, the G4 ligand RHPS4 may
   possess antitumor activity. Here, we show that RHPS4 triggers a rapid
   and potent DNA damage response at telomeres in human transformed
   fibroblasts and melanoma cells, characterized by the formation of
   several telomeric foci containing phosphorylated DNA damage response
   factors gamma-H2AX, RAD17, and 53BP1. This was dependent on DNA repair
   enzyme ATR, correlated with delocalization of the protective telomeric
   DNA-binding protein POT1, and was antagonized by overexpression of POT1
   or TRF2. In mice, RHPS4 exerted its antitumor effect on xenografts of
   human tumor cells of different histotype by telomere injury and tumor
   cell apoptosis. Tumor inhibition was accompanied by a strong DNA damage
   response, and tumors overexpressing POT1 or TRF2 were resistant to RHPS4
   treatment. These data provide evidence that RHPS4 is a telomere damage
   inducer and that telomere disruption selectively triggered in malignant
   cells results in a high therapeutic index in mice. They also define a
   functional link between telomere damage and antitumor activity and
   reveal the key role of telomere-protective factors TRF2 and POT1 in
   response to this anti-telomere strategy.

AB Brain aging is characterized by a complex pattern of decline and
   stability that includes differential regional shrinkage as well as
   redistribution of functional activation and deactivation. Many have
   noticed an apparent paradox of age-related increase in activation of
   structures that undergo the greatest structural deterioration. P. M.
   Greenwood (2007) proposes a theoretical framework for explaining that
   paradox by postulating plastic compensatory remodeling in the aging
   brain. This is a worthy first step, although several problems in
   formulating a testable set of hypotheses remain to be addressed. The
   working definition of plasticity that is driving this theory needs to be
   clarified. The biological basis, strength, and replicability of
   structure-function relationships derived from neuroimaging, on which
   Greenwood relies in her theorizing, remain to be established. The
   extrapolation of plasticity phenomena observed in acute lesions to
   gradual aging process needs to be justified. All in all, this is a
   positive development in the field that may be ripe for theoretical
   generalizations.

AB The credibility of quantitative social science benefits from policies
   that increase confidence that results reported by one researcher can be
   verified by others. Concerns about replicability have increased as the
   scale and sophistication of analyses increase the possible dependence of
   results on subtle analytic decisions and decrease the extent to which
   published articles contain full descriptions of methods. The author
   argues that sociology should adopt standards regarding replication that
   minimize its conceptualization as an ethical and individualistic matter
   and advocates for a policy in which authors use independent online
   archives to deposit the maximum possible information for replicating
   published results at the time of publication and are explicit about the
   conditions of availability for any necessary materials that are not
   provided. The author responds to several objections that might be raised
   to increasing the transparency of quantitative sociology in this way and
   offers a candidate replication policy for sociology.

   analyses within cultures showed that the normative American structure
   was replicated in all cultures; however, the congruence coefficients
   were slightly lower in China and Italy. A similar analysis at the facet
   level confirmed the high cross-cultural replicability of the AFFM.
   Mean-level comparisons did not always show the hypothesized effects. The

EP 587
PD SEP 2007
PY 2007
AB Background: Low-carbohydrate diets are often used to promote weight
   loss, but their effects on psychological function are largely unknown.
   Objective: We compared the effects of a low-carbohydrate, high-fat
   (LCHF) diet with a conventional high-carbohydrate, low-fat (HCLF) diet
   on mood and cognitive function.
   Design: Ninety-three overweight or obese participants [x +/- SEM age:
   50.2 +/- 0.8 y; body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 33.6 +/- 0.4] were
   randomly assigned to an energy-restricted (approximate to 6-7 MJ, 30%
   deficit), planned isocaloric LCHF diet or an HCLF diet for 8 wk. Body
   weight and psychological well-being were measured by using the Profile
   of Mood States, Beck Depression Inventory, and Spielberger State Anxiety
   Inventory instruments at baseline and fortnightly. Cognitive functioning
   (working memory and speed of processing) was assessed at baseline and
   week 8.
   Results: The LCHF diet resulted in significantly greater weight loss
   than did the HCLF diet (7.8 +/- 0.4 and 6.4 +/- 0.4 kg, respectively; P
   = 0.04). Both groups showed improvements in psychological well-being (P
   < 0.01 for time), with the greatest effect occurring during the first 2
   wk, but there was no significant difference between groups. There were
   no significant between-group differences in working memory (P = 0.68),
   but there was a significant time X diet interaction for speed of
   processing (P = 0.04), so that this measure improved less in the LCHF
   than in the HCLF diet group.
   Conclusions: Both dietary patterns significantly reduced body weight and
   were associated with improvements in mood. There was some evidence for a
   smaller improvement in cognitive functioning with the LCHF diet with
   respect to speed of processing, but further studies are required to
   determine the replicability of this finding.

   to findings of null birthorder results seem to stem from a
   misunderstanding of the difference between study designs where birth
   order is confounded with true causal influences on intelligence across
   families and designs that control for some of these influences. We
   discuss some of the consequences of not appreciating the nature of this
   difference. When between-family confounds are controlled using
   appropriate study designs and techniques such as multilevel modeling,
   birth order is shown not to influence intelligence. We conclude with an
   empirical investigation of the replicability and generalizability of
   this approach.

   Bradshaw, 2001). Currently, little is known about how specific colors
   become associated with specific letters and digits in synaesthesia.
   Beeli, Esslen, and Jancke (2007, this issue) report an interesting
   relation between grapheme frequency and the luminance and saturation of
   synaesthetic color experiences. They had 19 synaesthetes choose colors
   for spoken digits and letters from a digital color palette. The colors
   were quantified in terms of their hue, saturation, and luminance (the
   HSL color system). The results showed (a) that the luminance of
   synaesthetic colors increased with the frequency of digits in everyday
   language and (b) that the saturation of synaesthetic colors increased
   with increased letter and digit frequency. These findings indicate that
   there is a relation between how graphemes are encountered ( and perhaps
   learned) in language and the basic qualities of synaesthetic color
   experiences. To assess the replicability of the findings reported by
   Beeli et al., we analyzed the grapheme- color pairings we have collected
   on-line over the past 5 years for large groups of synaesthetes and
   nonsynaesthetes.

   the relation of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2
   (MMPI-2) and Cloninger's temperament-character inventory (TCI).
   Method: To find MMPI-2 scales associated with maximization of group
   differences between 222 DSM-IV alcohol dependent inpatients and a
   control group of 222 normal subjects, discriminant analysis was used. In
   addition, a cluster analysis was performed with these scales, and the
   MMPI-2 mean scale values of the resulting patient clusters were examined
   for their TCI-correlates.
   Results: The discriminant analyses showed several MMPI-2 scales that
   could clearly distinguish between alcohol-dependent patients and the
   normal controls. Cluster analysis resulted in semantically different
   MMPI-2 profiles implying qualitatively different groups of patients.
   When related to TCI scales, these differences revealed harm avoidance,
   self-directedness, and persistence, amongst others, as important
   elements in the description of the clusters.
   Conclusion: Evidence for the validity of MMPI-2 constructs as well as
   those of the TCI in the assessment of alcohol-dependent patients was

   assess the extent to which an individual perceives interpersonal
   distancing from family, friends, and ethnic group community members.
   Intragroup marginalization is defined as the interpersonal distancing
   that occurs when an acculturating individual is believed to exhibit
   behaviors, values, and beliefs that are outside the heritage culture's
   group norms. Intragroup marginalization is based on social identity
   theory that asserts that groups maintain their identity by the
   distinctive behaviors of its members. When an acculturating individual
   displays behaviors or attitudes that differ from the heritage culture
   group's norms, the group may respond to the threat with social
   alienation of the transgressor. The results support the IMI's validity
   via a) content validity in the development of the items, b) construct
   validity in the selection of the factors based upon an exploratory
   factor analysis, c) the replicability of the factors based upon a
   confirmatory factor analysis, and d) discriminant validity through

   those who had been active in CSIs at 9- and 18-month follow-up periods,
   but who were no longer active at 36 months (n = 35); and (c) a
   comparison group of Participants who were never active in CSIs (n = 42).
   Data were gathered at baseline, 9-, 18-, and 36-month follow-ups. The
   three groups were comparable at baseline on a wide range of demographic
   variables, self-reported psychiatric diagnosis, service use, and outcome
   measures. At 36 months, the continually active participants scored
   significantly higher than the other two groups of participants on
   community integration, quality of life (daily living activities), and
   instrumental role involvement, and significantly lower on symptom
   distress. No differences between the groups were found on other outcome
   measures. Improvements in 36-month outcomes for people with mental

AB A functional single nucleotide polymorphism in the 5 genomic region of
   CD14 (CD14/-159) is one of the most widely tested genetic variations in
   relation to asthma and associated traits. The results of these studies
   have shown a remarkable, statistically significant heterogeneity, with
   some studies indicating the T-allele as a risk factor, others the
   C-allele, and others finding no association. Recent studies in which
   exposure to house-dust endotoxin or to domestic sources of microbial
   exposure were assessed concomitantly with CD14/-159 have shown a
   consistent, replicable gene-environment interaction. Specifically,
   results suggest that the C-allele is a risk factor for allergic
   phenotypes at low levels of exposure, whereas the T-allele is a risk
   factor at high levels of exposure. This finding seems to be explained by
   a genetically-determined heterogeneity for the protective effect of
   microbial exposure on allergic phenotypes, with homozygotes for the
   C-allele showing a much stronger negative association between exposure
   and allergic outcomes than carries of the other two genotypes. These
   results suggest that the often encountered, limited replicability of
   genetic associations may, at least in part, be due to complex
   interactions between genes and environment in determining asthma-related
   outcomes.

AB Nanotechnology, like other emerging technologies that increasingly
   characterize the dynamic of our era, makes specific demands on
   datamining to track and interpret efficiently what is happening, through
   publications and other scientific output. We here propose and describe a
   strategy based on an automated lexical modular methodology to overcome
   rapidly evolving content and classification problems, which may
   otherwise accommodate poor quality of data and expert bias, with
   potential dire consequences for interpretation. decision and strategy.
   The proposed methodology is based on an initial nanostring enriched and
   screened by eight subfields, automatically identified and defined
   through the journal inter-citation network density displayed in the
   initial core nanodataset. Relevant keywords linked to each subfield are
   then tested for their specificity and relevance before being
   sequentially incorporated to build a modular query. We then, as a first
   test, compare the database constructed using this methodology for years
   2003 and 2005 with those obtained by other approaches previously used to
   cover and explore the nanotechnology dynamic. Finally, using the
   inherent transparency, portablity and replicability of our methodology,
   we offer, in order to help our initial query evolve and develop, a set
   of evaluation processes for tests by researchers in the nano field,
   other scientometric teams and intelligence experts involved in
   decision-making processes. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background. Debates about the modifiability of cognitive ability have
   been largely resolved by reports of successful 'thinking skills'
   interventions. However, such interventions are very diverse and
   generalization of effects relatively little explored.
   Aims. This study investigated whether a thinking skills intervention
   involving collaborative interactive dialogue could lead not only to
   gains in measured verbal cognitive ability but also generalization to
   non-verbal and quantitative reasoning ability.
   Sample. Randomly selected intervention children were aged 10 at pre-test
   (N = 105, four classes/schools). Controls followed a normal curriculum
   (N = 72, three classes/two schools).
   Method. Intervention children engaged in collaborative enquiry for 1
   hour per week over 16 months. The control group received normal
   classroom experiences. The Cognitive Abilities Test was administered
   before and after the intervention.
   Results. Intervention pupils showed significant standardized gains in
   verbal and also in non-verbal and quantitative aspects of reasoning,
   consistent across intervention schools. Boys and girls made significant
   gains. The highest quartile of pre-test ability showed the smallest
   gains. Controls did not gain in any aspect.
   Conclusions. Philosophical enquiry involving interactive dialogue led
   not only to significant gains in measured verbal cognitive ability but
   also generalization to nonverbal and quantitative reasoning ability,
   consistent across schools and largely irrespective of pupil gender and
   ability. The effect sizes from this large-scale field trial in one local
   authority exceeded those reported in the literature. Implications for
   theory building, replicability and sustainability are addressed.

AB Endothelial progenitors derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)
   hold much promise in clinical therapy. Conventionally, lineage-specific
   differentiation of hESCs is achieved through supplementation of various
   cytokines and chemical factors within the culture milieu. Nevertheless,
   this is a highly inefficient approach that is often limited by poor
   replicability. An alternative is through genetic modulation with
   recombinant DNA. Hence, this study investigated whether transduction of
   hESCs with an adenoviral vector expressing the human VEGF(165) gene
   (Ad-hVEGF(165)) can enhance endothelial-lineage differentiation. The
   hESCs were induced to form embryoid bodies (EBs) by culturing them
   within low-attachment plates for 7 days, and were subsequently
   trypsinized into single cells, prior to transduction with Ad-hVEGF165.
   Optimal transduction efficiency with high cell viability was achieved by
   4-h exposure of the differentiating hESCs to viral particles at a ratio
   of I : 500 for three consecutive days. ELISA results showed that
   Ad-hVEGF(165)-transduced cells secreted human vascular endothelial
   growth factor (hVEGF) for more than 30 days post-transduction, peaking
   on day 8, and the conditioned medium from the transduced cells
   stimulated extensive proliferation of HUVEC. Real-time PCR analysis
   showed positive upregulation of VEGF, Ang-1, Flt-1, Tie-2, CD34, CD31,
   CD133 and Flk-1 gene expression in Ad-hVEGF165-transduced cells.
   Additionally, flow cytometric analysis of CD133 cell surface marker
   revealed an approximately 5-fold increase in CD133 marker expression in
   Ad-hVEGF165-transduced cells compared to the non-transduced control.
   Hence, this study demonstrated that transduction of differentiating
   hESCs with Ad-hVEGF165 facilitated expression of the VEGF transgene,
   which in turn significantly enhanced endothelial differentiation of
   hESCs. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The universality versus cultural specificity of Mexican personality
   dimensions was investigated by examining: (a) the replicability of
   Mexican personality dimensions assessed by indigenous inventories; and
   (b) the extent to which Mexican dimensions are encompassed by the
   Five-Factor Model (FFM), one hypothesized universal model of personality
   structure. Mexican university students (N=794) completed nine indigenous
   inventories and the Spanish version of the Revised NEO Personality
   Inventory. The FFM replicated well, although reliability was poor for a
   few facet scales. Reliability was acceptable for the indigenous Mexican
   scales. However, for most indigenous instruments, a cross-sample
   replication criterion suggested alternative structures of fewer, more
   replicable dimensions. Multiple regression and joint factor analyses
   revealed that most of the Mexican dimensions were well subsumed by the
   FFM. Thus, cultural differences did not involve clearly culture-specific
   dimensions, but more subtle differences in the salience or cultural
   flavor of particular traits. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective. To validate a method for the presumptive diagnosis of
   cutaneous leishmaniasis based on the observation of
   clinical-epidemiological criteria, carried out by community health
   workers in three endemic municipalities in Santander, a department in
   northeastern Colombia.
   Methods. This evaluation study of diagnostic technologies was based on a
   cross-sectional sampling of suspected cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis
   in the municipalities of Rionegro, El Playon, and Landazuri. After being
   trained, the community health workers carried out the presumptive
   diagnoses of cutaneous leishmaniasis between October 2004 and November
   2005. At the time of diagnosis, the health workers also collected
   samples for confirmatory diagnosis through Field's stain method,
   culturing, and polymerase chain reaction. Four criteria were used to
   assess the validity of the presumptive diagnoses carried out by the
   health workers: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and
   negative predictive value. Replicability among the health workers was
   estimated through their observed level of agreement.
   Results. According to the laboratory tests, of the 196 patients studied,
   33 (16.8%) were negative and 163 (83.2%) were positive. For all the
   levels of certainty of the clinical diagnosis, the sensitivity was
   between 52% and 98% (kappa(1, 0) = 39.0%) and the specificity between 9%
   and 55% (kappa(0, 0) = 14.0%). The area under the receiver operating
   characteristic curve was 56.5% (95% confidence interval: 45.6% to
   67.4%). The proportion of positive agreement and of negative agreement
   was 86.3% and 43.5%, respectively.
   Conclusions. The sensitivity of the presumptive diagnosis carried out by
   the health workers surpasses that of the parasitological diagnostic
   methods generally used in the three endemic areas, but its specificity
   is much lower. Even though this approach is not useful as a diagnostic
   test for cutaneous leishmaniasis or as a criterion for deciding to
   proceed with treatment or not., the method is useful for the active
   identification of cases in the community.

AB Considerations are presented that support the idea that the
   nonequilibrium phase transition in protein is accompanied t.y the growth
   of a colloidal nanocrystal (or the vitrified phase of a liquid crystal).
   To date. the dynamic transition forms of protein, which are "the source
   of the catalytic power of enzymes," have been poorly understood. In our
   experiments, we observed the dehydration (drying) of the colloid
   solution of protein in an open (far from thermodynamic equilibrium)
   one-component protein-water system. The protein in this state is found
   to acquire properties typical of matter self-organization, including the
   universal properties of colloidal nanocrystals of different nature,
   namely, nonequilibrium chaotic dynamics with self-replicability,
   autocatalysis, coherency, autowave fluctuations, synchronism,
   fractality, 3D epitaxial growth (stacking) of films. nucleation giving
   rise to blocks (cells) with shell nuclei, etc. It then follows that our
   realistic model of the nonequilibrium state of protein during growth of
   its colloidal nanocrystal provides an opportunity of studying the
   dynamics of the structural and energy-information features of the
   transition and solid colloidal nanocrystal line phases of protein. In
   addition, it allows researchers to gain fundamentally new information
   about the energy characteristics of protein under abiotic and biotic
   conditions.

   acquisition. Most notable of these factors are conscious and unconscious

AB For more than a quarter century, the Princeton Engineering Anomalies
   Research (PEAR) laboratory has engaged in a broad range of experiments
   on consciousness-related physical anomalies and has proposed a
   corresponding selection of theoretical models that have combined to
   illuminate the fundamental nature of the provocative phenomena that
   emerge. Productive pursuit of this topic has inescapably involved a
   spectrum of political, cultural, personal, and interpersonal factors
   that are normally not encountered in more conventional scientific
   scholarship, but have both enriched and complicated the enterprise in
   many ways. Some of the insights gleaned from the work are objectively
   specifiable, such as the scale and structural character of the anomalous
   effects; their relative insensitivity to objective physical correlates,
   including distance and time; the oscillating sequential patterns of
   performance they display; the major discrepancies between male and
   female achievements; and their irregular replicability at all levels of
   experience. But many others relate to subjective issues, such as the
   responsiveness of the effects to conscious and unconscious intention and
   to individual and collective resonance; the relevance of ambience and
   attitude in their generation; and the importance of intrinsic
   uncertainty as a source of the anomalies. This blend of empirical
   features predicates radical excursions of the dedicated models, and
   hence of the more general scientific paradigms, to allow consciousness
   and its subjective information processing capacities a proactive role in
   the establishment of objective reality, with all of the complications of
   specificity, causality, and reproducibility that entails. The attendant
   complexities of conceptualization, formulation, and implementation
   notwithstanding, pragmatic applications of these phenomena in many
   sectors of public endeavor now can be foreseen.

AB Over the greater portion of its long scholarly history, the, particular
   form of human observation, reasoning, and technical deployment we
   properly term "science" has relied at least as much on subjective
   experience and inspiration as it has on objective experiments and
   theories. Only over the past few centuries has subjectivity been
   progressively excluded from the practice of science, leaving an
   essentially secular analytical paradigm. Quite recently, however', a
   compounding constellation of newly inexplicable physical evidence,
   coupled with a growing scholarly interest in the nature and capability
   of human consciousness, are beginning to suggest that this sterilization
   of science may have been excessive and could ultimately limit its
   epistemological reach and cultural relevance. In particular, an array of
   demonstrable consciousness-related anomalous physical phenomena, a
   persistent pattern of biological and medical anomalies, systematic
   studies of mind/brain relationships and the mechanics of human
   creativity, and a burgeoning catalogue of human factors effects within
   contemporary information processing 'technologies, all display empirical
   correlations with subjective aspects that greatly complicate, and in
   many cases preclude, their comprehension on strictly objective grounds.
   However, any disciplined re-admission of subjective elements ' into
   rigorous scientific methodology will hinge on the precision with which
   they can be defined, measured, and represented; and on the resilience of
   established scientific techniques to their inclusion. For example, any
   neo-subjective science, while retaining the logical rigor,
   empirical/theoretical dialogue, and cultural purpose of its rigidly
   objective predecessor, would have the following requirements:
   acknowledgment of a proactive role for human consciousness; more
   explicit and profound use of interdisciplinary metaphors; more generous
   interpretations of measurability, replicability, and resonance; a
   reduction of ontological aspirations; and an overarching teleological
   causality. Most importantly, the subjective and objective aspects of
   this holistic science would have to stand in mutually respectful and
   constructive complementarity to one another if the composite discipline
   were to fulfill itself and its role in society.

AB The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is a widely used
   screening tool for post-natal depression (PND). Recent factor analytic
   investigations of the EPDS have suggested the instrument may be useful
   in the prediction of PND as the instrument appears to be
   multidimensional, thus facilitating sub-scale development for this
   purpose. The psychometric properties of the EPDS were evaluated in women
   in the third trimester of pregnancy. Confirmatory factor analyses found
   support for the multidimensionality of the instrument; however, there
   was clear variability in model fit to data suggesting previous reports
   of the stability of the underlying factor structure of this instrument
   may be over-optimistic. The potential for development of the EPDS as a
   predictive screening measure of PND is likely to be optimistic because
   of variability in the factor structure of the instrument over the course
   of pregnancy and in the post-natal period.

AB Objective. To examine the taxonomic categories derived from a
   reorganization of the popular and useful Multidimensional Pain Inventory
   (MPI)/Multiaxial Assessment of Pain (MAP) system.
   Design. Cluster-analytic procedures were utilized to analyze data from
   976 pain patients who presented for treatment at a pain clinic. Ward's
   method was utilized followed by seeded and unseeded k-means procedures
   and a discriminant function analysis.
   Results. Three clusters were interpreted as: Interpersonally Focused,
   Stoic, and Adaptively Focused. Discriminant analyses followed by
   internal and external classification analyses provide evidence for the
   stability and replicability of the new clusters. Fisher's linear
   discriminant classification function coefficients were produced for
   clinical use.
   Conclusions. Meaningful differences exist between the new MPI clusters
   and those previously reported. The results provide a contribution toward
   improvements on the original and popular MPI/MAP system.

AB Many users of the NEO-Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI; Costa & McCrae,

   subcomponents for each broad domain of the instrument similar to the
   facets of the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (Costa & McCrae, 1992).
   In this study, I examined the following: the replicability of the
   subcomponents in young adult university and middle-aged community
   samples; whether item keying accounted for additional covariance among
   items; subcomponent correlations with a measure of socially desirable
   responding; subcomponent reliabilities; and subcomponent discriminant
   validity with respect to age-relevant criterion items expected to
   reflect varying associations with broad and narrow traits. Confirmatory
   factor analyses revealed that all subcomponents were recoverable across
   samples and that the addition of method factors representing positive
   and negative item keying improved model fit. The subcomponents
   correlated no more with a measure of socially desirable responding than
   their parent domains and showed good average reliability. Correlations
   with criterion items suggested that subcomponents may prove useful in
   specifying which elements of NEO-FFI domains are more or less related to
   variables of interest. I discuss their use for enhancing the precision
   of findings obtained with NEO-FFI domain scores.

AB Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has the potential for clinical
   application in neuropsychiatry because it enables non-invasive and
   convenient measurement of hemodynamic response to cognitive activation.
   Using 24-channel NIRS in 12 healthy men, we examined the replicability
   of oxy-and deoxy-hemoglobin concentration ([oxyHb], [deoxyHb]) changes
   in the prefrontal cortex during the category fluency task over four
   repeated sessions (each I-week apart). Multiple methods were employed to
   evaluate the replicability of magnitude, location, and time course of
   the NIRS signals ([oxyHb], [deoxyHb]). Task performances did not differ
   significantly across sessions, nor were they significantly correlated
   with NIRS signals. Repeated measures ANOVA and variance component
   analysis indicated high replicability of magnitude for both NIRS
   measures, whereas the effect sizes of between-session differences in
   [oxyHb] were not negligible. The number and spatial location of
   significantly activated channels were sufficiently replicable for both
   measures, except that the across-session overlap of significantly
   activated channels was weak in [deoxyHb]. The time course of the
   activation was acceptably replicable in both measures. Taken together,
   these findings suggest there is considerable replicability of
   multiple-time measurements of prefrontal hemodynamics during cognitive
   activation in men. Further studies using different conditions or
   assessing sensitivity to longitudinal changes following interventions
   are necessary. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience

AB Despite the widespread use of the nociceptive flexion reflex (NFR)
   paradigm in clinical and experimental pain research, there is currently
   no consensus on how best to define NFR threshold. Accordingly, the
   present studies were designed to assess the accuracy and reliability of
   different NFR threshold scoring criteria. Study 1 compared 13 scoring
   criteria in their accuracy for identifying the presence of the NFR, then
   generated empirically derived cut-points for the best criteria, and
   examined the test-retest reliability of NFR thresholds derived from
   these cut-points. Study 2 evaluated the replicability of these findings
   in ail independent sample. Results from the two studies suggested that
   standardized peak (NFR Interval Peak z score) and mean (NFR Interval z
   score) biceps femoris electromyogram (EMG) activity were accurate and
   reliable criteria for defining NFR threshold. Acknowledging that
   cut-points may need to be adjusted for different research designs,
   graphs depicting sensitivity and specificity across a range of
   cut-points have been provided to facilitate researcher's
   decision-making. It is hoped that the results of these studies will
   promote a standard NFR threshold assessment methodology, and further
   encourage the application of the NFR paradigm in the investigation of
   mechanisms and characteristics of both painful and non-painful diseases.

AB There are five potential major roles for neuroimaging with respect to

   prediction of which normal or slightly impaired individuals will develop
   dementia and over what time frame, 3) for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's
   disease (AD) in demented individuals, (sensitivity) and separation of AD

   progression, and 5) for monitoring response to therapies. Focusing on
   the last role, no single imaging approach is yet ideal, as all trade-off
   speed, cost, and accuracy. Functional imaging (SPECT and PET) is best
   suited to tracking symptomatic therapy response, and anatomic (MRI
   volumetric) imaging or amyloid PET are more suited to reflect dementia
   modulation studies. The potential for imaging with respect to
   pharmacological studies of dementia - to provide surrogate markers for
   drug studies, to improve diagnosis, to speed evaluation of outcomes, and
   to decrease sample sizes is huge. At the present time, however, no
   single measure has sufficient proven reliability, replicability, or

AB OBJECTIVE. Our goal was to determine if multiple courses of antenatal
   betamethasone affect auditory neural maturation in 28 to 32 weeks'
   gestational age infants.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS. A retrospective cohort study was performed to
   compare auditory neural maturation between premature infants exposed to
   1 course of betamethasone and infants exposed to >= 2 courses of
   betamethasone. Inclusion criteria included all 28 to 32 weeks'
   gestational age infants delivered between July 1996 and December 1998
   who had auditory brainstem response testing performed ( 80- dB click
   stimuli at a repetition rate of 39.9/ second) within 24 hours of
   postnatal life as part of bilirubin- auditory studies. Infants with
   toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes infections, chromosomal
   disorders, unstable conditions, exposure to antenatal dexamethasone, and
   exposure to < 1 complete course of betamethasone were excluded. Auditory
   waveforms were categorized into response types on response replicability
   and peak identification as types 1 through 4 ( type 1 indicating most
   mature). Absolute and interpeak wave latencies were measured when
   applicable. Categorical and continuous variables were analyzed by using
   the chi(2) test and Student's t test, respectively.
   RESULTS. Of 174 infants studied, 123 received antenatal steroids. Of
   these, 50 received 1 course and 29 received >= 2 courses of
   betamethasone. There were no significant differences in perinatal
   demographics between the 2 groups. After controlling for confounding
   variables, there was no significant difference in mean absolute wave
   latencies, mean interpeak latencies, or distribution of response type
   between the 2 groups. There also was no significant difference in any
   auditory brainstem response parameters between infants exposed to 1
   course of betamethasone ( n = 50) and infants exposed to > 2 courses of
   betamethasone ( n = 17).
   CONCLUSION. Compared with a single recommended course of antenatal
   steroids, multiple courses of antenatal betamethasone are not associated
   with a deleterious effect on auditory neural maturation in 28 to 32
   weeks' gestational age infants.

   of evidentiary competence that refers to the concepts and reasoning
   skills involved in the collection, organization, and interpretation of
   data. We proposed a set of concepts and skills involved in evidentiary
   competence and examined sixth of them-the priority, relevancy,
   objectivity, replicability of evidence, and the interpretation of
   examples and tables-using a written instrument contextualized in
   atmospheric science. Analyses of 40 sixth grade students' answers and
   explanations revealed that their understanding of scientific evidence
   and the data collection process was quite weak in several respects. For
   example, many students neither appreciated the role of empirical
   evidence in scientific inquiry, nor distinguished relevant evidence from
   irrelevant evidence, nor understood the importance of reliable and
   objective observations, nor interpreted examples and tables
   appropriately. Results suggest that more explicit instructions are
   needed in order to strengthen students' ability to collect and interpret
   data, especially in the current data rich information age.

   Jean-Michel Kantor, a mathematician, maintain that this contrast is
   simplistic and undervalues area studies. They show that an area studies
   approach can help understand, not only society, but mathematics and
   quantitative approaches themselves. They use an area studies approach to
   help explain developments in set theory and relativity theory and call
   for a resurgence of area studies, for both intellectual and political
   reasons. At the same time, they do not undervalue social science, and
   celebrate its achievements. As they argue, a sophisticated understanding

   photoperiod sensitivity (PS), vernalization requirement (VR) and
   intrinsic earliness (IE). A QTL meta-analysis was carried out to examine

   meta-QTL (MQTL). Initial QTL were projected on a recent consensus map
   (2004). Quality criteria were proposed to assess the reliability of this
   projection. These criteria were based on the distances between markers
   in the QTL regions. Chromosomes of groups 2 and 5 had a greater
   incidence on earliness control as they carry the known, major genes Ppd
   and Vrn. Other chromosome regions played an intermediate role in
   earliness control: 4A [heading date (HD) Meta-QTL], 4B (HD MQTL), 2B (VR
   MQTL) and 5B (IE MQTL). Markers at this four MQTL should prove helpful
   in marker-assisted selection, to better control earliness.

AB Embryonic stem (ES) cells, when grown in suspension culture without

   Given the appropriate conditions, these cells can differentiate over
   time into precursors of all three germ layers. Embryoid bodies, in a
   disorganized way, mimic early embryonic development to a certain extent
   and can be used as a synchronously differentiating large scale source of
   tissue for the study of biological determinants of early
   differentiation. Embryoid bodies have been used as a source for most
   early protocols that derive specific differentiated cell types from
   undifferentiated ES cells, although some protocols, notably those that
   derive neurons from ES cells, have moved on from EBs as a result of
   varying replicability and yield. We have decided to look at the
   transcriptomic profiles of embryoid bodies during the initial stages of
   embryoid body formation and differentiation, in order to pinpoint novel
   determinants of key developmental stages.

   framework is proposed on the basis of discriminant space,defined by
   essential properties or driving processes underlying occurrences of
   area-classes.Such a framework furnishes consistency in categorical
   mapping by imposing class-specific mean structures that can be regressed
   against discriminant variables,and facilitates scale-dependent error
   modeling that can effectively emulate the variation found among
   observers in terms of classes,boundary positions,numbers of polygons,
   and boundary network topology.Based on simulated data,comparisons
   between indicator Kriging-based stochastic simulation and Gaussian
   simulation confirmed the replicability of the discriminant space model
   for mapping the "mean" area-classes,reflecting mean responses of
   discriminant variables,and spatial uncertainty therein,mirroring

AB The study was designed to investigate the psychometric properties of the
   French version and the cross-language replicability of the Hierarchical
   Personality Inventory for Children (HiPIC). The HiPIC is an instrument
   to assess the five dimensions of the five-factor model for children.
   Subjects were 552 children aged between 8 and 12 years, rated by one or
   both parents. At a domain level, reliability ranged from .83 to .93 and
   at a facet level, reliability ranged from .69 to .89. Differences
   between genders were congruent with those found in the Dutch sample.
   Girls scored higher on Benevolence and Conscientiousness. Age was
   negatively correlated with Extraversion and Imagination. For girls, we
   observed a decrease of Emotional Stability. A series of exploratory
   factor analyses confirmed the overall five-factor structure for girls
   and boys. Targeted factor analyses and congruence coefficients revealed
   high cross-language replicablity at the domain and at the facet levels.
   the results showed that the French version of the HiPIC is a reliable
   and valid instrument for assessing personality with children and has a
   particularly high cross-language replicability.

AB This paper reports a novel UV soft-mold roller embossing technique for

   substrates. A soft-mold roller embossing facility with UV exposure
   capacity has been designed, constructed and tested in our laboratory. To
   fabricate the soft mold with an array of micro-block cavities, a silicon
   mold with a micro-cavity array was first fabricated by photolithography
   and deep reactive ion etching. A polycarbonate film was gas pressurized
   hot embossed against the silicon mold to obtain a master of
   micro-blocks. The soft mold for the roller stamp was obtained by casting
   the polydimethylsiloxane over the polycarbonate master to obtain an
   array of micro-block cavities. During rolling operation, a step motor
   drove the roller and pressed the UV-curable photopolymer layer on the
   glass substrate through the rolling zone. A micro-block array was
   obtained. At the same time, the micro-block array was cured by the UV
   light radiation while traveling through the rolling zone. The effect of
   various processing parameters on the replicability of the micro-blocks
   was investigated. Under the proper processing conditions, 100 times 140
   arrays of polymeric micro-blocks, with a dimension of 100 mum times 80
   mum times 40 mum can be successfully fabricated. The experimental
   results in this study suggest that UV soft-mold roller embossing
   provides an effective way of fabricating microstructures onto glass
   substrates. The technique can eventually be developed to be used as an
   effective roll-to-roll process at room temperature and with low

AB Partly because firm structures vary within an industry and partly
   because the industry, strategic group, and firm levels are significantly
   associated with firm performance, it is important to subcategorize the
   firms in an industry in an objective way. As an effective method in
   classifying industry substructure, the stock return method has been
   proposed in the field using the spot movements of stock returns upon
   inside and outside perturbations. In the paper, we apply the method to a
   sample in the airline, banking and oil industries over the period from
   1988 to 1992 in order to examine whether the groups found are reasonable
   from a common sense point of view and whether their structures are
   robust across different sample windows. We find that the groups
   identified show a clear face validity and that the group structures are
   consistently maintained across 1‐, 2‐, 3‐, and 5‐year windows. The
   results may imply that the method could detect both industry and
   strategic group effects at the same time. Given that objectivity and
   replicability are crucial in empirical studies, the stock return method
   is likely to introduce a way to enhance the level of empirical work in
   the strategic group research.

   and to explore the replicability of the Arabic Scale of Death Anxiety
   (ASDA) factors. A sample of 236 volunteer Kuwaiti personnel took part in
   the study. The mean ages of men and women were 41.5 (SD = 7.5) and 40.9
   (SD = 7.1), respectively. The alpha reliability of the ASDA was found to
   be high (.93). Women had a significantly higher mean total score on the
   ASDA as well as on 17 out of its 20 items. Middle-aged personnel had a
   significantly lower mean ASDA total score than younger college students
   (M age = 22). The factor analysis of the ASDA items yielded three
   factors: fear of dead people and tombs; fear of postmortem events; and
   fear of lethal disease. These factors were highly replicable with
   previous factors extracted from a Kuwaiti college student sample. On the
   basis of the present findings, there are three general conclusions as
   follows: death anxiety is negatively associated with age; the
   sex-related differences on death anxiety are salient in the Arab
   samples; and the ASDA has a highly replicable factor structure.

AB This paper describes a new method of temperature control for injection
   molding of plastics using a sheet metal laminated mold. In injection
   molding, the mold is normally cooled in order to shorten the forming
   cycle time. However, higher mold temperature is preferable during the
   resin filling period from the viewpoint of resin flowability. In this
   study, the mold temperature was controlled so that the core is heated
   during the resin filling period followed by cooling until the plastic
   part is ejected from the mold. The sheet metal laminated mold enables
   this heating and cooling cycle because channels for hot and cool water
   can be circulated uniformly adjacent to the mold surface. This
   temperature control using the sheet metal laminated mold has such
   advantages as high-cycle forming, improved flowability of resin,
   superior replicability, and high accuracy of the injection molded parts.

AB The IUCN-The World Conservation Union Red List categories provide a
   globally-accepted framework for classifying animal and plant taxa
   according to their risk of extinction. Different versions of the
   categories have been in use for forty years. Their present form, version
   3.1 published in 2001, demands a quantitative assessment of species
   status, and has been carefully designed to accommodate the spectrum of
   case-studies from large mammals to mosses or commercially-exploited
   trees to poorly-known insects. Consequently, the categories are assigned
   by the use of any one of five major criteria that infer either past or
   potential species population declines, or habitat declines, restriction
   in geographical distribution or population numbers. For the uninitiated
   assessors of forest species, the categories may present a daunting need
   for largely unavailable data. In this paper, we would like to
   demonstrate that the categories can be applied through the use of
   available forest management data, biological inventory datasets and/or
   proxy information on habitats, as well as a certain amount of inference
   or extrapolation. Developing standards for using the criteria at a
   national level promotes consistency, replicability and a shared
   understanding of the categories. Furthermore, shared standards can be
   developed and applied across regions through forest genetic resource
   networks and species specialist networks (e.g. APFORGEN and the IUCN
   Species Survival Commission (SSC) Global Tree Specialist Group), and
   contribute to global indicators of biodiversity loss relevant to the
   Global Strategy on Plant Conservation and the Convention on Biological
   Diversity's 2010 target.

AB In this commentary, we discuss the limitations of linguistic judgements
   by comparing them to a variety of other empirical data types. In
   particular, we show that judgements are inherently multimensional in
   that they incorporate a range of linguistic and extra-linguistic
   influences, which cannot be teased apart by only considering the final
   judgement itself Judgements of the gradient and time-insensitive type
   therefore give rise to the same interpretation problems as those faced
   by introspection. Thus, while we agree with Featherston that an
   improvement of data replicability in theoretical linguistics is highly
   desirable, we disagree with his claim that gradient judgements can
   provide significantly more grammatically-relevant information than other
   types of empirical data.

AB Objective: Tissue factor (TF) is known as the primary initiator of blood
   coagulation. Previous studies have suggested a considerable variation in
   the monocytic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated TF antigen levels and
   procoagulant activities between different individuals. Our aim with the
   present study was to investigate the replicability of LPS induced TF
   mRNA production in a series of standardised experiments with the purpose
   to identify putative factors influencing the TF high and low response.
   Results: A constant and reproducible production of LPS induced TF mRNA
   was identified in five high responders and three low responders (out of
   42 individuals) and followed-up in three subsequent experiments
   performed over 2 years. The LPS induced TF mRNA production correlated
   with the corresponding expressions of interleukin-8, tumor necrosis
   factor-alfa and interleukin-1 beta, indicating a common pathway with the
   TF high and low response. A strong and significant correlation between
   the LPS induced TF and toll-like receptor 4 mRNA expressions was
   subsequently identified and replicated.
   Conclusions: We demonstrated a high and low responder phenomenon of LPS
   induced TF mRNA in human monocytes. The production of toll-like receptor
   4 mRNA was significantly enhanced in TF high responders. (c) 2006

AB Yarrabah is a small Aboriginal community in far North Queensland,
   Australia, which experienced an epidemic of suicide in the 1980s. A
   sudden end to the epidemic in the late 1990s has been attributed by some
   to the success of a suicide prevention programme called the Yarrabah
   Family Life Promotion Program. This paper assesses the replicability of
   this programme and points out that the Yarrabah story provides rich
   insight into the reasons why interventions grounded in a true or
   "structural" community development process are more likely to be
   effective than interventions that operate in isolation from the
   community, or which involve primarily "instrumental" community

AB This paper presents theory and methods used to construct an
   interregional commodity by industry flow matrix for the United States.
   The interregional flow matrix method involves the construction of
   single-state (and DC) social accounting matrices (SAMs) using data
   derived from IMPLAN. Once complete, the interregional flows connecting
   states are estimated using a method based on the commodity flow survey
   data published by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The estimated
   interregional SAM is then adjusted to insure the integrity of
   intra-regional and system-wide accounts. The procedures have been
   designed with ease of replicability as a goal so that updates and
   extensions of the database can be generated efficiently and at low cost
   as new data are released. The resulting US interregional framework
   describes flows within and among the 51 regions. The method is flexible
   and will provide a valuable database for a broad range of analyses on
   regions, interregional relationships, and policy.

AB Background. This paper evaluates the replicability of an NCI-funded
   didactic/experiential program to increase the diversity of
   doctorally-prepared cancer disparities investigators. Methods. The
   program was developed and operated successfully for three years in
   Northern California when a replication was established at UCLA.
   Feasibility, process, impact, and outcome measures on UCSF and UCLA
   summer- institute participants were compared. Results. Average
   participant rankings of the influence of the program on intention to
   apply for a doctorate were 9.1/10 (UCSF) and 8.6/10 (UCLA). A total of
   22.5% of UCSF and 10% of UCLA participants have enrolled in, been
   accepted by, or completed doctoral programs. Among these alumni, 68%
   (21/3 1) of UCSF and 60% (3/5) of UCLA participants plan to conduct
   their doctoral research in cancer control. Conclusions. This program has
   been successfully replicated and has met its objective to increase the
   pipeline of ethnically diverse doctoral-levet public health researchers.
   Expansion of the program to other regions of the US is feasible and
   indicated.

AB Background: A common theme is emerging in sentinel reports on the United
   States health care system. Consumer relevance and demands on service
   systems and practices are influencing how mental health care is
   delivered and how, systems will be shaped in the future.
   Aims of the Study: The present report seeks to assemble a confluence of
   consumer-driven themes from noteworthy reports on the state of the
   mental health system in the U.S. It also explores innovative efforts,
   promising practices, collaborative efforts, as well as identification of
   barriers to consumer-directed care, with possible solutions.
   Method: The report reviews the relevant public mental health policy and
   data used in published work.
   Results: The findings indicate an increasing public and private interest
   in promoting consumer-driven care, even though historical systems of
   care predominate, and often create, barriers to widespread redesign of a
   consumer-c entered mental health care system. Innovative consumer-driven
   practices are increasing as quality, choice, and self-determination
   become integral parts of a redesigned U.S. mental health care system.
   Discussion and Limitations: The use of consumer-driven approaches in
   mental health is limited at best. These programs challenge industry
   norms and traditional practices. Limitations include the need for
   additional and thorough evaluations of effectiveness (cost and clinical)
   and replicability of consumer-directed programs.
   Implications for Health Care Provision and Use: Consumer-driven services
   indicate that mental health consumers are expecting to be more
   participative in their mental health care. This expectation will
   influence how traditional mental health services and providers become
   more consumer-centric and meet the demand.
   Implications for Health Policies: Public and private interest in
   consumer-driven health care range from creating cost-conscious consumers
   to individualized control of recovery. The health care sector should
   seek to invest more resources in the provision of consumer-driven health
   care programs. The results of this study have implications and are
   informative for other countries where consumer-directed care is
   delivered in either the private or public health care systems.
   Implications for Further Research: More research is needed to obtain
   further evidence on the use of consumer-driven services and their
   overall effectiveness.

AB A motivational model integrating self-deter-mination theory and the
   theory of planned behavior was tested in two samples for exercise and
   dieting behavior respectively. Relative autonomous motivation from
   self-determination theory was hypothesized to predict intentions to
   exercise or diet via the mediation of attitudes and perceived behavioral
   control (PBC) from the theory of planned behavior. It was also expected
   that attitudes and PBC would predict actual levels of exercise and
   dieting behavior via the mediation of intentions. Relations in the
   proposed model were expected to be invariant across the behaviors. Two
   samples of participants (N = 511) completed measures of the autonomous
   motives, attitudes, subjective norms, PBC, and intentions with respect
   to exercise and dieting behavior. Four weeks later, participants
   self-reported their behavior. Structural equation models supported the
   replicability of the proposed model in both behaviors. Findings
   supported the majority of the hypothesized effects in the proposed model
   across the two health behaviors. However, four effects were
   significantly different across the two behaviors: the effect of
   autonomous motives on intentions, subjective norms and PBC on
   intentions, and intentions on behavior. Findings extend knowledge of the
   processes by which psychological antecedents from the theories affect
   health behaviors integral to the maintenance of energy balance.

AB Pemphigus are rare but informative models of organ-specific autoimmune
   diseases, resulting from the interplay of environmental, genetic and
   stochastic factors. There are many arguments to consider that pemphigus
   have a genetic basis involving, as many other autoimmune diseases,
   several different genes with additive or synergistic effects. So far,
   the unique strategy used to identify the contributive loci has been
   direct analysis of candidate genes through conventional case-control
   association studies. The major histocompatibility complex in particular
   the class II locus was demonstrated to be associated with pemphigus with
   a high rate of replicability. The progresses in the understanding of
   pemphigus physiopathology and the development of new molecular tools
   offer new perspectives to unveiled the genetic basis of this group of
   autoimmune blistering diseases, as shown by recent studies of candidate
   genes expressed at different levels of the autoimmune process.

AB Background Event-related potentials (ERPs) have been suggested as
   possible endophenotypes of schizophrenia. We investigated the
   test-retest reliabilities and heritabilities of three ERP components in
   healthy monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs.
   Methods ERP components (P300, P50 and MMN) were recorded using a
   19-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) in 40 healthy monozygotic twin
   pairs, 19 of them on two separate occasions, and 30 dizygotic twin
   pairs. Zygosity was determined using DNA genotyping.
   Results High reliabilities were found for the P300 amplitude and its
   latency, MMN amplitude, and P50 suppression ratio components. ICC = 0.86
   and 0.88 for the P300 amplitude and P300 latency respectively.
   Reliability of MMN peak amplitude and mean amplitude were 0.67 and 0.66
   respectively. P50 T/C ratio reliability was 0.66. Model fitting analyses
   indicated a substantial heritability or familial component of variance
   for these ERP measures. Heritability estimates were 63 and 68% for MMN
   peak amplitude and mean amplitude respectively. For P50 T/C ratio, 68%
   heritability was estimated. P300 amplitude heritability was estimated at
   69%, and while a significant familiality effect was found for P300
   latency there was insufficient power to distinguish between shared
   environment and genetic factors.
   Conclusions The high reliability and heritability of the P300 amplitude,
   MMN amplitude, and P50 suppression ratio components supports their use
   as candidate endophenotypes for psychiatric research.

   453). The DIPSI's 4 higher order factors-that is, Emotional Instability,
   Disagreeableness, Introversion, and Compulsivity-showed clear
   correspondence with the dimensions of personality pathology found in
   adulthood (Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology-Basic
   Questionnaire; W. J. Livesley, 1990; Schedule for Nonadaptive and
   Adaptive Personality; L. A. Clark, 1993). These 4 factors can be further
   organized into 2 superfactors, representing Internalizing and

   The implications for the assessment and conceptualization of early trait
   patholygy are discussed in the context of an integrative developmental
   perspective on the construction of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual

   of the present study was to verify the effect of the age of the donor
   bitch on the quantity and quality of oocytes recovered from isolated
   ovaries, using the slicing technique. Ten bitches (45 days to 13 years)
   were ovariohysterectomized, and the ovaries were placed in phosphate
   buffered saline (PBS), supplemented with bovine fetal serum (5%), and
   oocyte-cumulus-complexes (OCCs) were obtained by slicing the ovarian
   tissue. The OCSs were classified morphologically as Degree I (DI, best),
   Degree II (DII) and degenerated. A total of 427 oocytes were acquired,
   including 81, 109 and 237 that were graded as DI, DII and degenerated,
   respectively. Slicing yielded no OCS from animals < 2 months of age. In
   senile (> 9 years) bitches, bitches, there were more oocytes per bitch,
   compared to adult (2-6.5 years) bitches, but fewer DI oocytes, and more
   DII and degenerate oocytes. We inferred that using donors that were
   post-pubertal but not senile, would assure the recovery of high-quality
   oocytes by the slicing method. Additional studies are required to assess
   the quality of oocytes collected from pre-pubertal versus post-pubertal
   bitches < 2 years of age. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Inc.

   workforce that was not prepared in public health; the impending loss of
   significant agency expertise, leadership, and institutional knowledge
   through retirement; the lack of available and accessible training; and
   continuing state budget cuts. Preparedness for bioterrorism and other
   public health emergencies was also of concern, a need made more urgent
   after 2001, To respond to current and emerging public health challenges,
   the SCDHEC had to have a workforce With the knowledge and skills
   necessary for the delivery of essential public health services. To
   address these challenges, the department partnered with the University
   of North Carolina in the pilot of the Management Academy for Public
   Health. The Management Academy is now integrated into the South Carolina
   workforce development strategy, and 199 staff members and 22 community
   partners have graduated from the program. Along with increased
   knowledge, skills, and abilities of individual staff and increased
   organizational and community capacity, a significant result of South
   Carolina's experience with the Management Academy for Public Health is
   the development of a training program for emergency preparedness modeled
   on the Management Academy. This highly successful program illustrates
   the replicability of the Management Academy model.

   mean that Cl falls. The authors investigated the distribution of this
   percentage for sigma known and unknown, for various sample sizes, and
   for robust CIs. The distribution has strong negative skew: Most 95% CIs
   will capture around 90% or more of replication means, but some will
   capture a much lower proportion. On average, a 95% Cl will include just
   83.4% of future replication means. The authors present figures designed

AB That empirical evidence is replicable is the foundation of science.
   Ronald Fisher, a founding father of biostatistics, recommended that a
   null hypothesis be rejected more than once because "no isolated

   experimental demonstration of any natural phenomenon" (Fisher 1974:14).
   Despite this demand, animal behaviorists and behavioral ecologists
   seldom replicate studies. This practice is not part of our scientific
   culture, as it is in chemistry or physics, due to a number of factors,
   including a general disdain by journal editors and thesis committees for
   unoriginal work. I outline why and how we should replicate empirical
   studies, which studies should be given priority, and then elaborate on
   why we do not engage in this necessary endeavor. I also explain how to

AB Over 130 genes have been associated with schizophrenia in genetic
   studies. None of these has reached a sufficient level of confidence to
   be accepted as a universal susceptibility gene and problems of
   replicability suggest that many may be false positives. Nevertheless,
   these genes can be grouped into distinct families related to glutamate
   transmission (in particular related to NMDA receptor function), the
   control of synaptic plasticity, dopaminergic transmission, oxidative
   stress, glutathione and quinone metabolism and oligodendrocyte
   viability. These families mirror the processes disrupted in the
   schizophrenic brain and certain gene families can be linked together to
   form a clearly defined signalling cascade involved in the phenomenon of
   NMDA receptor-dependent long-term potentiation and synaptic plasticity,
   that may be interconnected with oligodendrocyte and oxidative
   stress-related pathways. Many of the protein products of these genes
   interact with each other, forming complex integrated networks. Certain
   high-interest genes (for example DISC1, NRG1, COMT) may exert multiple
   effects on different areas of these pathways, while others exert more
   specific effects on certain branches. The convergence of a large number
   of genes on a definable signaling network raises the possibility of
   numerous interactions between gene candidates, and suggests that a
   targeted multigenic pathway approach would be useful in gene association

AB Traditional null hypothesis significance testing does not yield the
   probability of the null or its alternative and, therefore, cannot
   logically ground scientific decisions. The decision theory proposed here
   calculates the expected utility of an effect on the basis of (1) the
   probability of replicating it and (2) a utility function on its size. It
   takes significance tests-which place all value on the replicability of
   an effect and none on its magnitude-as a special case, one in which the
   cost of a false positive is revealed to be an order of magnitude greater
   than the value of a true positive. More realistic utility functions
   credit both replicability and effect size, integrating them for a single
   index of merit The analysis incorporates opportunity cost and is
   consistent with alternate measures of effect size, such as r(2) and
   information transmission, and with Bayesian model selection criteria. An
   alternate formulation is functionally equivalent to the formal theory,
   transparent, and easy to compute.

AB Aims - Most of the available evidence on the relationship between
   socioeconomic indicators of social deprivation and patterns of use of
   mental health services has been produced in the United Kingdom, where
   the Ministry of Health has developed a resource allocation formula based
   upon the results of those studies. The main aim of the paper is to
   evaluate the replicability in the Italian context of such research, and
   of the resulting allocation strategies. Methods - Detailed description
   of the resource allocation method currently adopted in the United
   Kingdom, whose main purpose consists in reaching the best balance
   between available funding and patterns of need. Detailed description of
   resource allocation processes in Italy; discussion of the main
   methodological and statistical limitations restraining the replicability
   of the British formula in the Italian context. Conclusions - There is a
   growing interest in Italy towards the introduction of evidence-based
   methods in health decision making, in order to correct the overwhelming
   influence of political issues. What is needed is a better understanding
   of the relationship between higher levels of equity in health services
   access, and their effects in terms of better outcomes.

   indicated that the predictive power of both approaches was remarkably
   robust between age 17 and 22, and even increased in the case of
   aggressiveness. At age 22 the long-term predictive ability of both types
   and dimensions was about equal, both in terms of the multivariate
   percentage of explained variance and the number of significant
   longitudinal correlates. This pattern is consistent with the notion that
   personality types and variables represent core personality domains that
   predict a wide range of longitudinal outcomes. However, the predictive
   ability of both approaches was larger for personality traits and
   intelligence than for social relationships outcomes. Implications for

   polymorphism was associated with increased rates of obsessive-compulsive
   personality disorder (OCPD) symptomology. We tested the replicability of
   this association within a further two independent groups of individuals
   with a history of depression, from a clinical sample (n = 149) and a
   family study (n = 213). The data from the replication samples and the
   original sample, within which the association was found, were compiled
   within a meta-analysis. Although the independent samples did not
   replicate the original finding, the meta-analysis elucidated significant
   evidence supporting the association. An individual with Gly/Gly genotype
   is 2.4 (P = 0.017) times more likely to be diagnosed with OCPD. Male
   gender was also found to be a significant predictor of OCPD diagnosis
   (OR = 2.82, P = 0.001). An exploration of an association of DRD3 with
   Axis I anxiety disorder diagnoses and Temperament and Character
   Inventory (TCI) traits, in particular persistence, revealed no support
   for an association. We conclude that DRD3 may contribute to the
   development of OCPD. (c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB Applying quantitative trait analysis methods to genome-wide
   microarray-derived mRNA expression phenotypes in segregating populations
   is a valuable tool in the attempt to link high-level traits to their
   molecular causes. The massive multiple-testing issues involved in
   analyzing these data make the correct level of confidence to place in
   mRNA abundance quantitative trait loci (QTL) a difficult problem. We use
   a unique resource to directly test mRNA abundance QTL replicability in
   mice: paired recombinant inbred (RI) and F-2 data sets derived from
   C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) inbred strains and phenotyped using the
   same Affymetrix arrays. We have one forebrain and one striatum data set
   pair. We describe QTL replication at varying stringencies in these data.
   For instance, 78% of mRNA expression QTL (eQTL) with genome-wide
   adjusted p <= 0.0001 in RI data replicate at a genome-wide adjusted p <
   0.05 or better. Replicated QTL are disproportionately putatively
   cis-acting, and approximately 75% have higher apparent expression levels
   associated with B6 genotypes, which may be partly due to probe set
   generation using B6 sequence. Finally, we note that while trans-acting
   QTL do not replicate well between data sets in general, at least one
   cluster of trans-acting QTL on distal Chr 1 is notably preserved between
   data sets.

AB BACKGROUND: The randomized controlled trial (RCT) is considered the
   'gold standard' methodology for evaluating efficacy of an intervention.
   It has been argued that RCTs cannot be used to examine the effectiveness
   of acupuncture.
   PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to examine the applicability of an
   RCT study design for acupuncture research.
   FINDINGS: RCTs would be more effective in studying acupuncture if study
   participants were randomized to groups based on the acupuncture
   diagnosis and not solely on the Western diagnostic criteria. Treatments
   must also be standardized somewhat to ensure replicability of the study
   and the information it provides. Blinding is not absolutely necessary
   for a good-quality RCT; however, if used, control groups need to be
   standardized and sham techniques evaluated to ensure accurate
   interpretation of results.
   CONCLUSIONS: With these factors combined, it is possible to greatly
   increase internal and external validity in acupuncture RCTs.

   national and international level are giving this a high priority. Also,
   ecological validity and replicability of mainstream quantitative studies

AB This paper examines the ordinary least squares estimates of the
   Klein-Goldberger model by Fox (Journal of Political Economy, 64, 1956,
   128). Because Klein and Goldberger published the data set with the
   model, it is possible to re-examine Fox's results years later, and
   investigate the accuracy with which these estimates were calculated. The
   examination reported in this paper was conducted by making independent
   estimates using three different modern econometric software packages.
   This examination reveals that the Fox estimates for a number of the
   equations of this model are replicable, to the two or three digits
   reported by Fox. Fox's results for other equations cannot be replicated.
   Not all the reasons for this lack of replicability can be determined,
   but in several cases the computational methods used by Fox and his
   assistants have been found to be faulty by modern computational
   standards.

AB This paper provides a brief overview of the transfer function approach
   to sea-level reconstruction. Using the example of two overlapping
   sediment cores from the North Norfolk coast, UK, the advantages and
   limitations of the transfer function methodology are examined. While the
   selected cores are taken from different sites, and display contrasting
   patterns of sedimentation, the foraminiferal transfer function distils
   comparable records of relative sea-level change from both sequences.
   These reconstructions are consistent with existing sea-level index
   points from the region but produce a more detailed record of relative
   sea-level change. Transfer functions can extract sea-level information
   from a wider range of sedimentary sub-environments. This increases the
   amount of data that can be collected from coastal deposits and improves
   record resolution. The replicability of the transfer function
   methodology, coupled with the sequential nature of the data it produces,
   assists in the compilation and analysis of sea-level records from
   different sites. This technique has the potential to bridge the gap
   between short-term (instrumental) and long-term (geological or
   geophysical) records of sea-level change.

AB In the past, various strategies based on top-down approaches were
   employed to curb the housing crisis in less developed countries (LDCs),
   but most failed because they did not engage the community in development
   projects. During the 1980s, the UN launched the bottom-up approach,
   which emphasizes the involvement of community-based organizations in
   shelter projects. This approach promotes enabling strategies in an
   effort to overcome obstacles encountered under the top-down approach:
   namely displacement, affordability, cost-recovery, and replicability.
   This paper explores what LDCs are doing to implement the bottom-up
   approach, and this is accomplished by examining the cases of Nairobi,
   Kenya, and Santo Domingo, the Dominican Republic. The study analyzes how
   the governments of both countries have responded to the policies
   promoted under the two approaches. Data on government policies are
   analyzed to find out whether the governments of Kenya and the Dominican
   Republic have provided an enabling environment for other actors. This
   study reveals that both governments have adopted enabling policies in
   their National Action Plans which include: facilitating the efforts of
   all actors in providing shelter; the use of non-conventional building
   materials; and the upgrading of low-income housing. This research shows
   that the bottom-up approach is more likely to be successful in
   overcoming factors that inhibit the provision of low-income housing as
   compared to the top-down approach. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   batch reactors were fed with synthetic sewage, two of which received
   additionally NPE. Small subunit rDNA-derived denaturing gel gradient
   electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles and 16S rDNA clone libraries were
   dominated by clones of Gammaproteobacteria class. Sequences of the other
   codominant rDNA phylotypes observed only in DGGE from NPE-amended
   reactors were, respectively, associated with the Group III of the
   Acidobacteria phylum. Intriguingly, 16S rRNA content from abundant
   Gammaproteobacteria cells was unexpectedly low. In addition to
   Acidobacteria, rRNA-derived DGGE profiles were dominated by members of
   the order Burkholderiales (of the Betaproteobacteria) and of the genus
   Sphingomonas (a member of the Alphaproteobacteria). Specific
   oligonucleotide probes for the selected ribotypes were designed and
   applied for quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction and

AB After a short introduction on the importance of the agro-food sector in
   the economies of most of present-day societies, the article focuses on
   the role of agriculture in protecting the environment and enhancing
   biodiversity. The importance of a shift toward agricultural systems,
   which are more complex in terms of biodiversity in emerging countries
   such as China, where most of the population (about 70%) lives in rural
   areas, in poor conditions and still relies on agriculture as the main
   source of income is discussed. In China the risk of shifting to more
   intensive and polluting agricultural production patterns to address the
   demand for food of the growing population and the need of higher incomes
   of rural communities is relatively high. With the present Chinese
   economic growth, urbanization and increased leisure time, tourism and
   recreation activities in rural areas are also increasing. Additionally,
   in the restructuring process of economy in rural areas, one of the most
   obvious effects is the necessity to create job opportunities alternative
   to agricultural sector. The role of sustainable agriculture for
   environment protection in a country such as China is highlighted. The
   attention paid to activities in the agro-environmental sector has been
   increasing over the years in this country due to the high social and
   economic priority attached by the Chinese authorities to the
   modernization of agriculture that must be pursued in a sustainable
   manner, addressing at once food security, environment protection,
   economic development and good management of natural resources. The
   experience gained in the framework of the Sino-Italian Cooperation
   Programme for Environment Protection jointly launched by the Italian
   Ministry for the Environment and Territory (IMET) and the State
   Environment Protection Administration of China (SEPA) in the year 2000,
   through the implementation of several cooperation projects in different
   rural areas of China is critically discussed. The approached adopted,
   avoiding pursuing short-term objectives, due to the pressure for profit,
   to ensure the replicability and long-term sustainability of transferred
   technologies are described. Important in all cooperation projects
   carried out have been training and information activities to enable the
   actual transfer into practice of target sustainable agricultural
   technologies and practices. All stakeholders have been involved in
   project preparation and implementation. Particularly, academic
   institutions, public research centers and private companies have been

   District workshop and seminar have been organized in order to keep
   people involved in project activities continuously aware of all progress
   as well as to inform stakeholders on scientific, technical and economic
   feasibility of upcoming new techniques and systems. The synergic role
   provided by the different projects in promoting environment protection

AB With the rapid development of human genome project, increased genetic
   and population-based association studies are focused on the
   identification of the underlying susceptibility genes and contributions
   from gene-environment interaction to common complex diseases.
   Whole-genome association study with high-density single nucleotide
   polymorphisms is one of the most important milestones in that process.
   However, problems still exist in study design, data processing, and
   results interpretation. Large-scale cohort study or population-based
   case-control design with sufficient statistical power, new approaches to
   assess the gene-gene and gene-environment interactions, as guarantee of
   the consistency and replicability of these researches are crucial in the
   exploration of the causes of these common complex diseases.

AB A recently proposed method for determining sex from the os coxae reports
   a 98% success rate using European collections. The purposes of the
   present study are to (1) evaluate the success rate of this proposed
   method using modern American os coxae from different population
   subgroups; (2) compare the success rate of the new method with that
   obtained using traditional techniques; and (3) determine replicability
   of the new method and interobserver error. Eight hundred and seventy-six
   adult left os coxae were independently evaluated by both authors.
   Summary statistics for sex classifications were calculated for the total
   sample and for a random sample of 400 individuals. The impact of sex and
   ancestry on the success of each method was calculated on the random
   sample using Pearson's chi(2) values. Results demonstrate that for
   modern American os coxae, neither sex nor race have a significant impact
   on the success rate for either the new or traditional methods (p <
   0.01). Additionally, the success rate of the new method is comparable
   with that obtained using traditional techniques. Finally, interobserver
   error using the new method for overall sex determination is low.

AB This article is one in a series of articles sponsored by the Academy of
   Neurologic Communication Disorders and Sciences (ANCDS) to address
   issues related to evidence-based practice guidelines in neurologic
   communication disorders. The purpose of this article is to evaluate
   voice outcome measurement in studies of intervention for unilateral
   vocal fold paralysis (UVFP). This review addresses two outcome
   measurement issues: the types of outcome measures represented and the
   research methods by which outcome measurement is conducted and reported.
   This focus on outcome measurement was selected because establishing
   reliable, feasible, and meaningful outcome measures is a critical step
   in the process of documenting treatment efficacy. Collecting and
   interpreting outcome data are key components of clinical and research
   practices for speech-language pathologists (SLPs). This article presents
   a review of outcome measurement in 92 studies published from 1990
   through 2003. The report summarizes the distribution of intervention
   types and voice outcome measures and then addresses topics pertinent to
   the quality of measurement such as experimental control, psychometric
   control, replicability, and missing data. Recommendations are provided
   as to how outcome measurement methods might be strengthened to promote a
   stronger treatment efficacy literature.

AB A study was conducted to develop an improved method for measuring
   organic N (net) mineralization in which chemical extraction takes place
   in combination with suspension incubation in ammonia-absorbing membrane
   bottles. To obtain direct evidence of the extent to which extracted
   organic N is mineralizable, the extraction suspension was further
   incubated immediately after the extraction procedure with mild and
   selective extractants. In this 'extraction incubation' method,
   extraction continues during the incubation but only relatively easily
   mineralizable organic matter is released. Standard incubation is usually
   carried out in sealed N-2-flushed bottles. However, when phosphate or
   pyrophosphate soil suspensions are incubated, mineralization is much
   higher than in soil water suspensions. Further, accumulation of ammonia
   + (ammonium) and other gases, i.e. CO2, can affect the reaction rate and
   final reaction equilibrium in the sealed incubation flask. It was to
   avoid these effects that the membrane method was developed. With this
   procedure, the flask is closed with an ammonia-absorbing membrane
   permeable to other gases. Water, phosphate and pyrophosphate suspensions
   were incubated at 37 degrees C in sealed bottles (SB), in sealed N-2
   gas-flushed bottles (SBN2), and in bottles with ammonia-trapping filters
   (MB). The maximum amount of NH4+ - N released during 10 days' incubation
   was 133.0 mg kg(-1) in the water, 208.0 mg kg(-1) in the phosphate and
   454.1 mg kg(-1) in the pyrophosphate suspension (soil total C content
   6.2% and N 0.25%). During incubation in phosphate and pyrophosphate
   suspensions, the mobilization was nearly linear in membrane bottles. The
   variation between replicates was also smallest in these bottles. It was
   concluded that membrane bottles were best suited to incubation when
   mobilization reactions were accelerated with phosphate or pyrophosphate
   extractants. The method was easy to perform and gave results with good
   replicability. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB RNA recombination is a major process in promoting rapid virus evolution
   in an infected host. A previous genome-wide screen with the yeast
   single-gene deletion library of 4,848 strains, representing similar to
   80% of all genes of yeast, led to the identification of 11 host genes
   affecting RNA recombination in Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV), a small
   model plant virus (E. Serviene, N. Shapka, C. P. Cheng, T. Panavas, B.
   Phuangrat, J. Baker, and P. D. Nagy, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA
   102:10545-10550, 2005). To further test the role of host genes in viral
   RNA recombination, in this paper, we extended the screening to 800
   essential yeast genes present in the yeast Tet-promoters Hughes
   Collection (yTHC). In total, we identified 16 new host genes that either
   increased or decreased the ratio of TBSV recombinants to the
   nonrecombined TBSV RNA. The identified essential yeast genes are
   involved in RNA transcription/metabolism, in protein
   metabolism/transport, or unknown cellular processes. Detailed analysis
   of the effect of the identified yeast genes revealed that they might
   affect RNA recombination by altering (i) the ratio of the two viral
   replication proteins, (ii) the stability of the viral RNA, and/or (iii)
   the replicability of the recombinant RNAs. Overall, this and previous
   works firmly establish that a set of essential and nonessential host
   genes could affect TBSV recombination and evolution.

   of different versions of the EMBU (Egna Minnen av Barndoms Uppfostran -
   My memories of upbringing) in a non-clinical sample of adolescents. The
   factor structure of the questionnaire was studied by means of more
   adequate exploratory and confirmatory factor procedures in order to
   ascertain which version achieves a better fit to data. The 64-item
   version of the EMBU was administered to a non-clinical sample of 832
   adolescents. Exploratory and Confirmatory factor analyses were carried
   out for successive versions of 64, 37, 24 and 23 items. The theoretical
   four-factor structure of the 64-item version is not replicated in a
   factor analysis through principal axis extraction with direct oblimin
   rotation. The "Favoring Subject" factor was not found. 37 items present
   loadings equal to or larger than 0.30 for the "Rejection", "Emotional
   Warmth" and "Overprotection" factors. A re-analysis of these items shows
   a clear three-factor structure. When Arrindell et al.'s (1999) 23-item
   version was analysed, the three expected factors were also found.
   Confirmatory factor analyses allow us to reduce the 36-item version to a
   shorter one of 24 items. This last version achieves the best fit to
   data, including the 23-item version. The new 24-item version improves
   the construct validity of the EMBU and presents similar reliability
   coefficients.

AB Bioreactors hold great promise for treating graywater in an advanced
   life support system for space applications. However, questions remain
   regarding the reproducibility and reliability of biological systems for
   long-term use. Although there have been numerous studies on ground-based
   biological systems, most studies focus on a single reactor or a simple
   (single carbon) waste stream. There have been very few studies on
   microbial communities in replicate reactors using a nonsterile, complex
   waste stream. In this report, we describe the characterization of five
   replicate denitrifying reactors receiving a complex feed, including
   urine and limb washes from donors at Johnson Space Center over a 100-day
   period. Denitrifying conditions were employed because of the ease in
   adding a terminal electron acceptor to the bioreactor. Bacterial
   populations were tracked by 16S rRNA and nosZ genes T-RFLP analysis to
   target the total and denitrifying microbial communities. The results
   demonstrated reproducible biological communities with nearly identical
   performance that slowly changed with time and exhibited low variability
   with respect to the bacterial community (T-RFLP peak area) in all
   reactors. These results suggest that, when designed for replication,
   bioreactors are not stochastic systems exhibiting chaotic behavior, but
   are biological systems that can be highly reproducible and reliable.

AB The main objective of this study is to develop a case study of the
   market of water use rights established in the Water Code of Chile of
   1981. The evaluation of the Water Code of 1981 shows that this
   allocation system based on water rights market has significant economic
   benefits. However, the adequate application of this system requires
   strengthening the institutional framework to achieve the integrated
   management and sustainable use of water. In addition, it can be
   concluded that the performance of the water use rights market in Chile
   has been variable. The variability in performance of the market can be
   explained by problems both related to and independent of the allocation
   system. The most important problems independent of the water allocation
   mechanism are those arising as a result of unavoidable transaction
   costs, externalities due to inadequate definition of use rights in the
   Water Code, and uncertainty regarding the availability of water.
   Likewise, certain problems related to the allocation system have been
   identified, viz., the lack of adequate and timely information; the
   difference between nominal and in rem (latin term used to describe
   jurisdiction over property without regard to personal jurisdiction)
   rights; conflicts arising between users due to the sale of traditional
   rights; unavoidable transaction costs; and the hoarding of
   non-consumptive rights. In summary, the water use rights market
   represents a useful allocation mechanism for water resources. However,
   it is necessary to reformulate the regulatory framework of this
   mechanism so as to reduce the existence of conditioning factors that
   have limited the efficiency, sustainability, and replicability of this
   allocation mechanism.

AB Prototypes of personality were investigated in two studies. In study I,
   clusters of Big-Five-based prototypes were examined using a general
   population sample of 1908 German adults. Convergent evidence suggested
   the appropriateness of a five-cluster solution, which corresponds to
   previously identified temperament based prototypes. In study II, the
   five-cluster solution was cross-validated in a sample of 256 prisoners.
   Moreover, it was shown that a population-based approach (using
   discriminant functions derived from study I) was superior over the
   traditional sample-based cluster approach (using Ward followed by
   k-means). The authors argue that future typological research can be

AB To investigate recent hypotheses of replicable personality types, we
   examined data from 1540 self sorts on the California Adult Q-Set (CAQ).
   Conventional factor analysis of the items showed the expected
   Five-Factor Model (FFM). Inverse factor analysis across random
   subsamples showed that none of the previously reported person-factors
   were replicated. Only two factors were replicable, and, most
   importantly, these factors were contaminated by mean level differences
   in item endorsement. Results were not due to sample size or age
   heterogeneity Subsequent inverse factor analysis of standardized items
   revealed at least three replicable factors; when five person-factors
   were extracted, they could be aligned precisely with the dimensions of
   the FFM. The major factors of person similarity can be accounted for
   entirely in terms of the FFM, consistent with the hypothesis that there
   are no replicable personality types in the CAQ. Published in 2006 by

AB This article discusses the linkages between two recent themes in
   economic research: "real time" data and replication. These two themes
   share many of the same ideas, specifically, that scientific research
   itself has a time dimension. In research using real-time data, this time
   dimension is the date on which particular observations, or pieces of
   data, became available. In work with replication, it is the date on
   which a study (and its results) became available to other researchers
   and/or was published. Recognition of both dimensions of scientific
   research is important. A project at the Federal Reserve Bank of St.
   Louis to place large amounts of historical data on the Internet holds
   promise to unify these two themes.

   by pressing the patterned mold against the substrate which is heated
   above the glass transition temperature, and it is a high throughput
   fabrication method for bio chip, optical microstructure, etc. due to the
   simultaneous large area patterning. However, the bad pattern fidelity in
   large area patterning is one of the obstacles to applying the hot
   embossing technology for mass production. In the present study, PDMS pad
   was used as a cushion on the backside of the micro-patterned 4 inch Si
   mold to improve the pattern fidelity over the 4 inch PMMA sheet by
   increasing the conformal contact between the Si mold and the PMMA sheet.
   The pattern replicability improvement over 4 inch wafer scale was
   evaluated by comparing the replicated pattern height and depth for
   PDMS-cushioned Si mold against the rigid Si mold without PDMS cushion.

   The history of allocation formulae for the National Health Service is

   'Logical and statistical deficiencies' we consider various frameworks,
   model misspecification, allowance for age, ins and outs of supply, unmet

   are relevant to trust in the current formula based on the regression of

   this method, unmethylated and methylated DNA fractions are enriched
   using a series of treatments with methylation sensitive restriction
   enzymes, and interrogated on microarrays. We have investigated various
   aspects of the technology including its replicability, informativeness,
   sensitivity and optimal PCR conditions using microarrays containing
   oligonucleotides representing 100 kb of genomic DNA derived from the
   chromosome 22 COMT region in addition to 12 192 element CpG island

   including the parallel identification of confounding effects of DNA
   sequence variation, the description of the principles of microarray
   design for epigenomic studies and the optimal choice of methylation
   sensitive restriction enzymes. We also demonstrate the advantages of
   using the unmethylated DNA fraction versus the methylated one, which
   substantially improve the chances of detecting DNA methylation
   differences. We applied this methodology for fine-mapping of methylation
   patterns of chromosomes 21 and 22 in eight individuals using tiling
   microarrays consisting of over 340 000 oligonucleotide probe pairs. The

AB Studies of the biological effects and any health related consequences of
   extremely low frequency (ELF) electromagnetic fields (EMF) have been
   going on for over half a century however with contradictory outcomes.
   Hence, it is now necessary to stress on standardizing the EMF-health
   research experiment procedures in order to enable such experiments
   become replicable and results comparable. In 1998, a review of several
   of the ELF EMF human biological interaction mechanisms regarding field
   intensities and frequencies was presented to the Australian Radiation
   Laboratory of Commonwealth Department of Community Services and Health
   in 1988 by Andrew W. Wood. Wood's 1988 assertion of the importance of
   understanding the interaction mechanisms did not alter even after a
   decade when the NIEHS RAPID (http://ww-w.niehs.nih.gov/) gathering of
   world experts produced their statement, in which quoted, there have been
   experiments on possible mechanism/s in support or refutation of the
   various proposals however none were replicated. Valberg (Valberg et al.,
   1997) also summed up some but failed to include all the claimed proposed
   mechanisms at the time.
   This paper is to present a complete list of the allegedly possible
   interaction mechanisms to date. This paper will also report on an
   academic research on computer modeling of biological effects of ELF EMF
   using one of the proposed mechanisms. The research reported here has
   generally aimed at modeling the proposals using computer. The initial
   phase of this effort has concentrated on Ca effect as the number of
   publications referencing that was considerable. Calcium is a key element
   in the biological performance of every organ in the human body. Thus it
   deemed imperative to study the effect of EMF on Ca channels of a living
   cell.
   Furthermore, considerations for setting standards in EMF experimental
   research protocols are recommended. Developing a standard protocol
   allows results of future experiments to be comparable; and, the chance
   of replicability in EMF-health improve, which this aspect has
   indisputably been absent in EMF research projects thus far. Replication
   is desirable mainly because it eliminates bias, artifact and systematic
   errors. Replication is almost impossible in the case of epidemiological
   studies however in experimentation is possible if the details are
   specified in full. To authenticate any effect of MF, it is not
   satisfactory to present experimental results without reporting the
   experimental settings in their entirety.

AB BACKGROUND: The co-morbidity of health conditions is becoming a
   significant health issue, particularly as populations age, and presents
   important methodological challenges for population health research. For
   example, the calculation of summary measures of population health (SMPH)
   can be compromised if co-morbidity is not taken into account. One
   popular co-morbidity adjustment used in SMPH computations relies on a
   straightforward multiplicative combination of the severity weights for
   the individual conditions involved. While the convenience and simplicity
   of the multiplicative model are attractive, its appropriateness has yet
   to be formally tested. The primary objective of the current study was
   therefore to examine the empirical evidence in support of this approach.
   METHODS: The present study drew on information on the prevalence of
   chronic conditions and a utility-based measure of health-related quality
   of life (HRQoL), namely the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3),
   available from Cycle 1.1 of the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS;
   2000-01). Average HUI3 scores were computed for both single and
   co-morbid conditions, and were also purified by statistically removing
   the loss of functional health due to health problems other than the
   chronic conditions reported. The co-morbidity rule was specified as a
   multiplicative combination of the purified average observed HUI3 utility
   scores for the individual conditions involved, with the addition of a
   synergy coefficient s for capturing any interaction between the
   conditions not explained by the product of their utilities. The fit of
   the model to the purified average observed utilities for the co-morbid
   conditions was optimized using ordinary least squares regression to
   estimate s. Replicability of the results was assessed by applying the
   method to triple co-morbidities from the CCHS cycle 1.1 database, as
   well as to double and triple co-morbidities from cycle 2.1 of the CCHS
   (2003-04).
   RESULTS: Model fit was optimized at s = .99 (i.e., essentially a
   straightforward multiplicative model). These results were closely
   replicated with triple co-morbidities reported on CCHS 2000-01, as well
   as with double and triple co-morbidities reported on CCHS 2003-04.
   CONCLUSION: The findings support the simple multiplicative model for
   computing utilities for co-morbid conditions from the utilities for the
   individual conditions involved. Future work using a wider variety of
   conditions and data sources could serve to further evaluate and refine
   the approach.

AB The paper describes an approach to the vexing problem of transport
   planning and policy. It deals jointly with three questions, which in
   today's practice are addressed separately: How are hypotheses about
   transport problems and alternatives to their solution developed? How can
   a good plan or policy be identified? What is the process of implementing
   a transport plan or policy? In doing this the paper has the ambitious
   objective of proposing a new model and process for transport planning
   and policy. It is applicable in developed and developing countries and
   is not restricted to the transport sector. The paper builds on, and is a
   reinterpretation of two cornerstone transport planning and
   decision-making models - the CATS (Chicago Area Transportation Study)
   Planning and Design Model and Braybrooke and Lindblom's Disjointed
   Incrementalism. It advances a technique of experiential incrementalism
   (termed polisanalysis) to develop and implement plans and policies. It
   proposes that problems should be diagnosed by observation and continuous
   data collection; that their continuous analysis, finding the "cure", and
   implementation take place through the method of experiential
   incrementalism. In this method interventions are grounded on the
   theories of neoinstitutional economics and psychoanalysis and derived
   using contact function, explained in the paper, which renders the method
   scientific replicability. Experiential incrementalism can employ a wider
   array of options in planning and policy than is presently thought
   possible. Like other scientific methods, its application requires
   rigorous training.

AB Assessment of the role of viral lysis in aquatic microbial communities
   requires a robust means of estimating viral production (VP). Here, 3
   incubation-based VP methods (fluorescently labeled viruses [FLV],
   dilution [DIL], and thymidine incorporation [TdR]) were evaluated in
   water samples from the Delaware and Chesapeake Bays. In Chesapeake Bay
   samples, average VP rates were 10-fold higher for FLV and DIL (similar
   to 3 to 25 x 10(10) viruses l(-1) d(-1)) than for TdR (similar to 0.2 to
   3 x 10(10) viruses l(-1) d(-1)). Estimates of viral-mediated bacterial
   mortality (VMM) indicate that FLV overestimates VP in eutrophic waters,
   since > 100 % of bacterial production (BP) would have been consumed
   through viral lysis. DIL and TdR VP methods gave more realistic
   estimates of VMM with respect to BP. The FLV method provides estimates
   of both VP and virus removal rates; however, it requires preparation of
   a viral tracer and twice as many microscopic enumerations as the DIL
   method. DIL was the least difficult and most efficient method; however,
   bacterial loss during vacuum diafiltration resulted in poor
   replicability. TdR gave similar VP estimates to DIL, but requires use of
   a large and poorly constrained conversion factor. With methodological
   improvements in bacterial cell recovery, DIL should be the most widely
   applicable method for estimation of VP in highly productive estuarine
   waters.

AB Outdated nomenclature and incorrect taxonomic characterisation of snake
   venoms in the current toxinological literature have serious implications
   for the replicability of results from snake venom toxin research. The
   situation has not improved, despite attempts to supply toxinologists
   with regular updates on snake systematics. Here, we demonstrate the
   successful extraction of DNA, and subsequent sequencing of the
   mitochondrial 12S gene, from dried snake venoms. This approach offers a
   new and potentially straightforward method for accurate species
   identification. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences isolated from snake
   venom can be used to clarify or validate snake species identification
   through comparison against existing sequences in the GenBank database,
   and through phylogenetic analyses with other sequences. Pooled venoms
   can also be screened a priori for the presence of multiple species, and
   the species names on the labels of commercial venoms verified. Moreover,
   if the species from which the venom sample has been taken is known, and
   the specimen is available as a voucher, the mtDNA sequence of the
   haplotype isolated from that species venom sample could serve as a
   sequence standard (or 'DNA barcode') for that species. Our new method of
   DNA barcoding venoms ensures the identification of venoms even after
   future taxonomic changes. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A database of mouse locomotor path in spatial tests can be used to
   search in silico for behavioral measures that better discriminate
   between genotypes and are more replicable across laboratories. In this
   study, software for the exploration of exploration (SEE) was used to
   search a large database for a novel behavioral measure that would
   characterize complex movement paths. The database included mouse
   open-field behavior assessed in 3 laboratories, 7 inbred strains,
   several pharmacological treatments and hundreds of animals. The new
   behavioral measure, 'path texture', was characterized using the local
   curvature of the path (the change of direction per unit distance, in
   degrees/cm) across several spatial scales, starting from scales smaller
   than the animal's body length and up to the scale of the arena size.
   Path texture analysis differs from fractal dimension analysis in that it
   does not assume self-similarity across scales. Path texture was found to
   discriminate inbred strains with relatively high broad-sense
   heritability (43%-71%) and high replicability across laboratories. Even
   genotypes that had similar path curvatures in some scales usually
   differed in other scales, and self-similarity across scales was not
   displayed by all genotypes. Amphetamine decreased the path curvature of
   C57BL/6 mice in small and medium scales, while having no effect on
   DBA/2J mice. Diazepam close-dependently decreased the curvature of
   C57BL/6 mice across all scales, while 2 anxiogenic drugs, FG-7142 and
   pentylenetetrazole, increased it. Path texture thus has high potential
   for behavioral phenotyping and the study of drug effects in the mouse.

   (FFM). Results showed that although Honesty-Humility was largely
   unrelated to markers of the Big Five factors, it was substantially
   correlated with the FFM Agreeableness domain. This relation was largely
   due to the Straightforwardness and Modesty facets of FFM Agreeableness,
   which were only weakly correlated with the Big Five version of
   Agreeableness. A realignment of FFM facets to produce separate
   Honesty-Humility and Agreeableness factors provided better prediction of

AB Paunonen (2002) recently developed the Supernumerary Personality
   Inventory (SPI), a measure of 10 traits that have low loadings within
   the space of the Big Five personality factors. If the SPI personality
   traits are representative of the domain of non-Big Five personality
   traits, then the major source of the variance in the SPI traits would be
   expected to correlate strongly with the sixth factor of personality,
   Honesty-Humility. We tested this hypothesis using self-report measures
   (N = 200) of the SPI traits, of the Big Five, and of the new
   six-dimensional ("HEXACO'') structure. Results indicated that the first
   unrotated factor underlying the 10 SPI traits was heavily saturated with
   variance from Honesty-Humility (r = .65). Nevertheless, the 10 SPI
   traits contained substantial amounts of unique variance not accounted
   for by the HEXACO or the Big Five variables, highlighting the importance
   of the facet-level assessment of personality traits.

AB We performed a comprehensive numerical and experimental analysis of
   dissociation effects in an air bubble in water acoustically levitated in
   a spherical resonator. Our numerical approach is based on suitable
   models for the different effects considered. We compared model
   predictions with experimental results obtained in our laboratory in the
   whole phase parameter space, for acoustic pressures from the bubble
   dissolution limit up to bubble extinction. The effects were taken into
   account simultaneously to consider the transition from
   nonsonoluminescence to sonoluminescence bubbles. The model includes (1)
   inside the bubble, transient and spatially nonuniform heat transfer
   using a collocation points method, dissociation of O-2 and N-2, and mass
   diffusion of vapor in the noncondensable gases; (2) at the bubble
   interface, nonequilibrium evaporation and condensation of water and a
   temperature jump due to the accommodation coefficient; (3) in the
   liquid, transient and spatially nonuniform heat transfer using a
   collocation points method, and mass diffusion of the gas in the liquid.
   The model is completed with a Rayleigh-Plesset equation with liquid
   compressible terms and vapor mass transfer. We computed the boundary for
   the shape instability based on the temporal evolution of the computed
   radius. The model is valid for an arbitrary number of dissociable gases
   dissolved in the liquid. We also obtained absolute measurements for R(t)
   using two photodetectors and Mie scattering calculations. The robust
   technique used allows the estimation of experimental results of absolute
   R-0 and P-a. The technique is based on identifying the bubble
   dissolution limit coincident with the parametric instability in
   (P-a,R-0) parameter space. We take advantage of the fact that this point
   can be determined experimentally with high precision and replicability.
   We computed the equilibrium concentration of the different gaseous
   species and water vapor during collapse as a function of P-a and R-0.
   The model obtains from first principles the result that in
   sonoluminescence the bubble is practically 100% argon for air dissolved
   in water. Therefore, the dissociation reactions in air bubbles must be
   taken into account for quantitative computations of maximum
   temperatures. The agreement found between the numerical and experimental
   data is very good in the whole parameter space explored. We do not fit
   any parameter in the model. We believe that we capture all the relevant
   physics with the model.

   but researchers need to explore further replicability using the US
   version in the graduate school population. In this study, the authors
   asked 335 graduate students attending the Northwestern student health
   clinic on the Chicago campus to complete a written survey anonymously. A
   total of 305 (91%) patients completed the survey. The sensitivity and
   specificity for the SCOFF was 53.3% and 93.2%, respectively. This
   produced a PPV (the proportion who tested positive on the screen and
   actually had an eating disorder) of 66.7% and an NPV (the proportion of
   those who tested negative on the screen and actually did not have an
   eating disorder) of 88.7%. More than 80% of respondents were
   dissatisfied with their shape and weight, with over one third having a
   moderate to severe body image disturbance. The SCOFF is an easy
   instrument to administer that health care providers can use to screen
   for eating disorders in the primary care setting.

   Methods: The MMNm was recorded twice by using a 122-channel whole-head

   duration, intensity and frequency deviants were analyzed separately in
   left and right hemispheres for the response strength, latency, dipole
   moment, and generator loci.
   Results: In the right hemisphere, the test-retest correlations were
   statistically significant for all MMNm parameters (r=0.49-0.89). In the
   left hemisphere, the majority of the MMNm parameters also demonstrated
   statistically significant test-retest correlations (r=0.61-0.82). In
   addition, the MMNm generator loci were stable for all deviants.
   Conclusions and significance: The present results are encouraging in

AB Motivation: In cluster analysis, the validity of specific solutions,
   algorithms, and procedures present significant challenges because there
   is no null hypothesis to test and no 'right answer'. It has been noted
   that a replicable classification is not necessarily a useful one, but a
   useful one that characterizes some aspect of the population must be
   replicable. By replicable we mean reproducible across multiple samplings
   from the same population. Methodologists have suggested that the
   validity of clustering methods should be based on classifications that
   yield reproducible findings beyond chance levels. We used this approach
   to determine the performance of commonly used clustering algorithms and
   the degree of replicability achieved using several microarray datasets.
   Methods: We considered four commonly used iterative partitioning
   algorithms ( Self Organizing Maps (SOM), K-means, Clutsering LARge
   Applications (CLARA), and Fuzzy C-means) and evaluated their
   performances on 37 microarray datasets, with sample sizes ranging from
   12 to 172. We assessed reproducibility of the clustering algorithm by
   measuring the strength of relationship between clustering outputs of
   subsamples of 37 datasets. Cluster stability was quantified using
   Cramer's v(2) from a kXk table. Cramer's v(2) is equivalent to the
   squared canonical correlation coefficient between two sets of nominal
   variables. Potential scores range from 0 to 1, with 1 denoting perfect
   reproducibility.
   Results: All four clustering routines show increased stability with
   larger sample sizes. K-means and SOM showed a gradual increase in
   stability with increasing sample size. CLARA and Fuzzy C-means, however,
   yielded low stability scores until sample sizes approached 30 and then
   gradually increased thereafter. Average stability never exceeded 0.55
   for the four clustering routines, even at a sample size of 50. These
   findings suggest several plausible scenarios: ( 1) microarray datasets
   lack natural clustering structure thereby producing low stability scores
   on all four methods; ( 2) the algorithms studied do not produce reliable
   results and/or ( 3) sample sizes typically used in microarray research
   may be too small to support derivation of reliable clustering results.
   Further research should be directed towards evaluating stability
   performances of more clustering algorithms on more datasets specially
   having larger sample sizes with larger numbers of clusters considered.

AB Autism constitutes one of the most investigated disorders in child
   psychiatry. The heterogeneous clinical phenomena that characterize it
   have been exhaustibly described along the last 62 years. Multiple
   aetiological hypothesis, neuropsychological theories and
   physiopathological mechanisms, sometimes complementary and other times
   mutually exclusive, and different descriptions of neurobiological
   alterations that resulted, in general, of low replicability, have
   attempted to account for the marked variability of its manifestations.
   An integration of these different levels of analysis results even harder
   than the comprehension of each of them separately. In this article the
   author revises the three aspects considered the most characteristic of
   the syndrome (social interaction, communication and flexibility) and
   tries to integrate its clinical manifestations with some
   neuropsychological variables and the neurobiological substrates.

AB Transcription is slow relative to many post-transcriptional processes in
   the brain. Using the rich system of division of labor in the honeybee
   (Apis mellifera), we found extreme differences in the extent to which
   behavioral occupations of different durations were associated with
   gene-expression differences in the brain. Nursing and foraging,
   occupations lasting &GT; 1 week, were associated with significant
   expression differences for nearly one-quarter of the genes tested (1208
   of 5563 cDNAs tested; P &LT; 0.01, ANOVA), consistent with previous
   results. In contrast, transitional occupations, performed for 1-2days
   after nursing and before the onset of foraging, were associated with
   either no differences (guards vs. undertakers; 19 cDNAs, fewer than the
   expectation of 56 false-positives) or few differences (comb builders vs.
   guards and undertakers; 248 cDNAs), but extensive differences relative
   to both nursing and foraging (&GT; 500 cDNAs, all contrasts).
   Statistical power analysis indicated that expression differences of
   two-, 1.5- and 1.25-fold should have been detected in 100, 92 and 37% of
   cases, respectively. Replication of previous results at these magnitudes
   was 95, 71 and 51%, with no genes showing differences in the opposite
   direction. These results indicate that behavioral plasticity over
   different time-scales may be associated with substantial differences in
   the extent of genomic plasticity in the brain.

AB Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) carried out in the last decades to
   test the Five-factor simple structure have generally obtained negative
   results. McCrae, Zonderman, Costa, Bond, and Paunonen (1996) suggested
   that CFA limitations were the main cause of such negative results. They
   also claim that Procrustes Orthogonal rotation method is an adequate
   procedure to test the replicability of the Five-factor structure. The
   aim of the present paper is twofold: (A) comparing several Exploratory
   factor procedures (including the Procrustes rotation) to test what is
   the most appropriate one to analyse the replicability of the Five-factor
   structure, and (B) replicating the CFA results of the McCrae et al.'s
   study with a larger number of subjects. The normative American (N =
   1000), and Spanish (2000) standardization samples of the NEO-PI-R,
   together with an independent university sample (N = 948) were analysed.
   Results were replicated in the three samples, and suggest that: (1)
   structural properties of the Five-factor model, as measured by the
   NEO-PI-R, are invariant irrespective of the Exploratory factor procedure
   used, and (2) when CFA limitations are surpassed, the Five-factor
   structure is supported. &COPY; 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Decreasing response to stress has been one goal of interventions aimed
   at reducing relapse to substances of abuse. A laboratory stress test
   that can be repeated would be helpful in testing the efficacy of
   interventions in decreasing the response to stress before more extensive
   trials are begun. The effects of two types of psychological stress
   tests, the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and a stress imagery test, on
   psychological, physiological, and hormonal responses (salivary cortisol
   and DHEA) were examined when each test was given twice to cocaine- or
   methamphetamine-dependent human subjects, 24 of whom completed at least
   one session. The stress imagery test produced significant changes in
   several of the subjective response measures in both first and second
   sessions, including several measures of negative affect and a craving
   measure. The TSST produced significant changes only in the second
   session. The stress imagery protocol showed better replicability across
   two sessions. Cocaine users and methamphetamine users did not respond
   similarly in their craving responses. Reported craving for
   methamphetamine after stress testing showed decreases or much smaller
   increases compared to that for cocaine. Neither stress test
   significantly increased salivary cortisol or DHEA, and changes in
   hormone concentrations were not related to subjective responses. These
   results suggest that stress imagery testing procedures may be useful as
   provocative tests of stress-induced affect and stimulant drug craving.
   Although less convincing because of the heterogeneity of the subjects,
   they also suggest that HPA axis responsivity is not clearly linked to
   acute stress-induced stimulant craving or affective response. (C) 2005

AB Mechanical stimulation of skin receptors is known to evoke cortical
   responses arising from the somatosensory cortex. Here we present a
   magnetoencephalographic (MEG) study where dermatomal
   somatosensory-evoked fields (DSSEFs) were recorded after mechanical
   stimulation of sacral (SI), lumbar (U), thoracic (TV), and cervical (C4)
   dermatomes in three healthy volunteers. All MEG measurements were
   repeated in order to test the replicability of the results. DSSEFs were
   successfully measured and modeled in all three participants. The
   topography and temporal dynamics of cortical responses derived after
   stimulation of each dermatome are described. We found that
   cortical-evoked responses can be reliably recorded using MEG after
   mechanical stimulation of dermatomes when a sufficiently large skin
   region within the dermatome is stimulated. Primary sensory cortex
   response (SI) to each of the four dermatomes was replicable and showed
   stability over time. The MEG-derived individual maps of activation
   confirm the somatotopic representation of dermatomes in primary sensory
   cortex and the utility of MEG recordings in disentangling the
   interactions between primary and secondary sensory cortex during somatic

AB The clinical utility of the EEG, especially in psychiatric, learning and

   quantitative analysis (QEEG) and comparisons to a normative database. Of
   primary importance in the use of such a reference database are the
   following considerations and cautions: adequate sampling across a broad
   age range; consideration of inclusion/exclusion criteria; adequate
   sample of artifact-free data to demonstrate reliability and
   replicability of norms; demonstration of specificity and sensitivity. A
   normative database meeting these criteria allows the multivariate
   description of patterns of QEEG abnormalities in patients as compared to
   age appropriate normative values, and the exploration of
   neurophysiological heterogeneity within populations. Demonstrations of
   the clinical significance of this approach exist in the scientific
   literature and demonstrate that QEEG provides high sensitivity and
   specificity to abnormalities in brain function seen in psychiatric
   populations.

AB The origin of modern Polynesians, the route of their expansion into the
   Pacific Ocean, and the timing of their movements all remain contentious
   topics in modern anthropology. Numerous studies have used molecular data
   to elucidate settlement patterns in the Indo-Pacific region, but the
   same evidence is often interpreted in opposing ways by different
   researchers. Above all, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) diversity has been
   used to discriminate between competing migration models and has narrowed
   the probable source of proto-Polynesian peoples to southern China and
   Taiwan or eastern Indonesia. Richards et al. (1998) used a dating method
   employing the p statistic to argue for an origin of Polynesian peoples
   in eastern Indonesia during the Pleistocene (> 10,000 years ago). Here,
   the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) is recalculated for
   a new series of Indonesian mtDNA sequences with Polynesian affinities.
   These data, which incorporate additional sequences published after 1998,
   produce dates that cannot rule out the possibility of a common ancestor
   for these sequences during the Holocene (< 10,000 years ago). This
   implies that previous estimates of TMRCA dates for Indonesian sequences
   lacked the statistical robustness necessary for replicability. The
   extant mtDNA evidence can no longer be viewed as favoring a Polynesian
   origin in eastern Indonesia, but instead remains consistent with an
   origin of proto-Polynesian peoples in southern China and Taiwan.

AB Background: With the progressive increase of publicly available contents
   on the Internet and as information searching has become one of the most
   frequent online activities, informal and common searching cannot respond
   to the aims of scientific research. In regard to the relevant contents
   in a specific field of knowledge in a nonorganized environment such as
   the Internet, the need to develop efficient procedures to guarantee a
   systematic search process arises.
   Aim: The aim of this article is to suggest a framework for developing
   systematic strategies for the exhaustive information seeking process on
   the Internet, easily adaptable to specific seeking goals.
   Method: Review and proposal of a framework for this decision making
   process based upon method and instruments selection, and equation
   development. Furthermore, the whole process is exemplified by the
   development of a systematic strategy in the field of the information
   about Health Psychology.
   Conclusions: The development of these procedures or strategies,
   articulated by means of the properties of exhaustiveness in the search
   process, replicability of the procedure and ecologic validity, is not
   arbitrary, but is directly related to the time spent in the carrying out
   of the process and the quality of the resulting information.

   personality type to volunteering during adolescence. We hypothesized
   that participants with more adaptive personality functioning during
   childhood would be more likely to volunteer during adolescence and that
   membership in social organizations would mediate the relation of
   personality to volunteering during adolescence. Participants from the
   National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) with complete data measures
   for the four time periods of study were categorized into one of three
   personality types during early childhood. Children assigned to the
   resilient personality type were more likely than children characterized
   by the overcontrolled and undercontrolled personality types to volunteer
   8 and 10 years later in adolescence. Analyses demonstrated that the
   association of childhood personality to adolescent volunteering is not
   mediated by late-childhood membership in social institutions that may
   facilitate entry into volunteering. The findings are interpreted in
   terms of their implications for understanding personality and prosocial
   behavior.

AB In behavior genetics, behavioral patterns of mouse genotypes, such as
   inbred strains, crosses, and knockouts, are characterized and compared
   to associate them with particular gene loci. Such genotype differences,
   however, are usually established in single-laboratory experiments, and
   questions have been raised regarding the replicability of the results in
   other laboratories. A recent multilaboratory experiment found
   significant laboratory effects and genotype x laboratory interactions
   even after rigorous standardization, raising the concern that results
   are idiosyncratic to a particular laboratory. This finding may be
   regarded by some critics as a serious shortcoming in behavior genetics.
   A different strategy is offered here: (i) recognize that even after
   investing much effort in identifying and eliminating causes for
   laboratory differences, genotype x laboratory interaction is an
   unavoidable fact of life. (h) Incorporate this understanding into the
   statistical analysis of multilaboratory experiments using the mixed
   model. Such a statistical approach sets a higher benchmark for finding
   significant genotype differences. (iii) Develop behavioral assays and
   endpoints that are able to discriminate genetic differences even over
   the background of the interaction. (iv) Use the publicly available
   multilaboratory results in single-laboratory experiments. We use
   software-based strategy for exploring exploration (SEE) to analyze the
   open-field behavior in eight genotypes across three laboratories. Our
   results demonstrate that replicable behavioral measures can be
   practically established. Even though we address the replicability
   problem in behavioral genetics, our strategy is also applicable in other
   areas where concern about replicability has been raised.

AB Background: This is a first attempt to evaluate the reliability and
   factor structure replicability of the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis,
   Pisa, Paris and San Diego Autoquestionnaire (TEMPS-A) in its Turkish
   Version. The questionnaire is a self-report 110-item measure that
   postulates five affective temperaments-the depressive, cyclothymic,
   irritable, hyperthymic, and anxious-which embody both strengths and
   liabilities along affective lines. Methods: The questionnaire was
   administered to 658 clinically-well subjects in a Turkish university
   circle. We undertook item analysis and test-retest reliability. We then
   examined internal consistency through factor analysis with PCA rotation.
   Results: We found good to excellent test-retest reliability (0.73-0.91),
   and internal consistency (0.77-0.85). We deleted 10 items with factor
   loading < 0.20 for their own subscales, resulting in a questionnaire
   with 99 items. Despite considerable overlap between depressive and
   cognitive anxiety traits, a distinct "nervous"-anxious factor emerged as
   well, and the hypothesized (original English) 5-factor structure of the
   TEMPS-A was supported. Cut-offs for each temperament were based on
   z-scores higher than +2S.D. Dominant irritable (3.7%). nervous-anxious
   (3.7%) and depressive (3.1%) temperaments were the most common in this
   population, whereas dominant cyclothymic (1.7%) and hyperthymic (1.2%)
   temperaments were relatively uncommon. These temperaments tended to lose
   their intensity with age. As expected, women scored significantly higher
   on the nervous-anxious, and men on the hyperthymic temperaments.
   Limitations: The sample was composed of younger subjects with higher
   education than the General population of Turkey. Although the
   distribution of the scores for each of the temperaments deviated
   somewhat from normal Curves, for heuristic reasons we did attempt to
   provide prevalence rates based on z-scores. Conclusion: In this
   preliminary version of the TEMPS-A, we have retained 100 (of the
   original 110) traits loading > 0.20. Some deleted items referred to
   sleep, others appeared socially desirability traits in the Turkish
   culture endorsed by many subjects. Nonetheless, item analyses within
   each factor revealed traits indicative of personal assets (specific to
   each temperament) along with those which might represent vulnerability
   to affective illness. This is in line with the hypothesized original
   theoretical framework of the senior authors. Even in this "first pass,"
   in its Turkish version the TEMPS-A is a reliable and valid instrument.
   Further refinement of the instrument will require the study of a
   nationally representative sample in Turkey. (c) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All

   given to 1090 Swiss subjects, whereas the Spanish (Castilian) version of
   the NEO-PI-R was administered to 1006 Spanish subjects. Results
   replicate the limitations of the NEO-FFI already found in other
   countries. Compared to the NEO-FFI, reliability coefficients and factor
   structure was enhanced by the NEO-FFI-R and the NEO-60 in both samples,
   although substantial differences were not found. The factor structure of
   the NEO-60 shows the best fit since only three items do not load mainly
   on their own factor in both samples. Besides, correlations between items
   and NEO-PI-R domain scores are also higher for the items included in the
   NEO-60 version. On the other hand, convergent correlations with the

   models generated after the three short versions. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In a publication of 1831 later seen as a milestone in the development of
   chemistry, Justus Liebig announced a new apparatus for the analysis of
   organic compounds and provided analytical results for fifteen
   substances. In this paper we used the detailed descriptions published by
   Liebig in 1837 to reconstruct his apparatus and methods for hydrogen,
   carbon and nitrogen analysis. Our replications of his analyses of
   racemic acid, cinchonine, narcotine, and urea reveal that his two pieces
   of apparatus give excellent results for carbon and hydrogen content, but
   erratic results for nitrogen. The results corroborate the assessments of
   Liebig and his contemporaries, and show that the analytical method for
   carbon and hydrogen analysis was remarkably accurate. We offer this
   case, with its convincing replicability, not only to clarify the nature
   of Liebig's innovations, but also as a new model for understanding
   broader contested issues in the philosophy and sociology of science. Our
   analysis suggests that the great shift in science from gentlemanly
   avocation to professional vocation was tightly linked to laboratory
   practice, and not just to social networks and context. It also provides
   the basis for a critique of H. M. Collins's theory of the
   'experimenters' regress'.

AB BACKGROUND: The advantages of manualized psychological treatments
   include: the promotion of evidence-based practice, the enhancement of
   treatment integrity, the facilitation of staff training, and the
   potential replicability of treatment.
   ARGUMENT: The manualization of a multi-component, multidisciplinary
   treatment programme for male personality-disordered offenders is
   described. The background to this development is explained and the
   treatment setting is described briefly, followed by a description of the
   eight treatment manuals: (1) the treatment overview, (2) Psychoeducation
   focusing on personality disorder diagnosis and core beliefs, (3) Trust
   and Self-awareness group exercises, (4) Stop and Think! -- a social
   problem-solving intervention, (5) Controlling Angry Aggression, (6)
   Controlling Substance Use, (7) Criminal Thinking/Belief Therapy, and (8)
   Skills for Living -- a social skills manual.
   CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the original aims of manualization, this
   exercise has clarified the treatment programme, included less highly
   trained staff in the delivery of therapy and permitted the evaluation of
   treatment modules, thus contributing to the incremental evaluation of
   the overall programme. These manuals may usefully be shared with other
   practitioners in the field.

PD 2005

AB Normal behavior plays a key role in facilitating homeostasis, especially
   by allowing the animal to control and modify its environment. Captive
   environments may interfere with these behavioral responses, and the
   resulting stress may alter many physiological parameters. Abnormal
   behaviors indicate that an animal is unable to adjust behaviorally to
   the captive environment and, hence, may be expressing abnormal
   physiology. Therefore, captive environments may affect the following
   aspects of an experiment: validity, by introducing abnormal animals into
   experiments; reliability, by increasing interindividual variation
   through the introduction of such individuals; and replicability, by
   altering the number and type of such individuals between laboratories.
   Thus, far from increasing variability, enrichment may actually improve
   validity, reliability, and replicability by reducing the number of
   abnormal animals introduced into experiments. In this article, the
   specific example of abnormal repetitive behaviors (ARBs) is explored.
   ARBs in captive animals appear to involve the same mechanisms as ARBs in
   human psychiatry, which reflect underlying abnormalities of brain
   function. ARBs are also correlated with a wide range of behavioral
   changes that affect experimental outcomes. Thus, ARBs in laboratory
   animals may compromise validity, reliability, and replicability,
   especially in behavioral experiments; and enrichments that prevent ARB
   may enhance validity, reliability, and replicability. Although many
   links in this argument have been tested experimentally, key issues still
   remain in the interpretation of these data. In particular, it is
   currently unclear (1) whether or not the differences in brain function
   seen in animals performing ARB are abnormal, (2) which common behavioral
   paradigms are affected by ARB, and (3) whether enrichment does indeed
   improve the quality of behavioral data. Ongoing and future work
   addressing these issues is outlined.

   American aboriginal culture was examined by assessing the replicability
   of the factor structure of the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale
   (TAS-20) in two different adult samples. The study also assessed the
   reliability of the scale and the influence of gender, age, and education
   on alexithymia levels. Method: The first sample was a community-based
   group of 123 aboriginal men and women; the second sample was 102 male
   aboriginal offenders. Both samples completed the TAS-20. Results: The
   replicability of the three-factor structure for the TAS-20 was supported
   in both groups using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The TAS-20 and
   its three factors demonstrated adequate internal reliability, and the
   variables of gender, age, and education accounted for small or
   nonsignificant amounts of variability in total TAS-20 and factor scale
   scores. Conclusion: The results provide additional support for the
   factorial validity of the TAS-20 in diverse cultural groups. (c) 2005

AB Many attempts have been made in the past to quantify the oxygen, organic
   carbon and nutrient fluxes (interchanges, transport) between sediment
   and water column, using different approaches, including experimental
   marine sediment systems (microcosms). However, geochemical processes and
   porewater solute distributions in sandy beds are not well studied with
   very few exceptions. An experiment was carried out to determine
   differences in nutrient fluxes between coarse and fine-grained sediment
   and water column in aquatic laboratory microcosms.
   Four 80-litre aquaria, containing seawater and ten sediment cores (8-cm
   diameter) each were monitored for 60 days. Coarse and fine-grained
   sediment, collected from two different coastal areas of Mytilini, island
   of Lesvos, were sieved to avoid macrofaunal bioturbation and
   homogenized. Two aquaria were used as replications for each treatment in
   order to validate the replicability of the experiment. Information
   related to chemical and biological parameters was collected from the
   water column, the interstitial water and the sediment (in 12-days
   interval). Net fluxes of oxygen and inorganic nutrients were measured by
   closing the sediment cores with a rubber stopper. The optimum incubation
   time was estimated to be 10 hours in a previous experiment. Water
   samples were collected just before closing the cores and after the
   incubation, in triplicates.
   The replicability of results within the microcosms of the same treatment
   was excellent in general and differences in trends of fluxes were
   presented for specific nutrients. Experimental data showed remarkable
   replicability in terms of temporal variability in both treatments. In
   most cases data had the same behaviour with only minor differences in
   the magnitude of values i.e. ammonium, silicate and nitrite. However,
   the nutrient fluxes between sediment and water column depicted
   significant individual fluctuations.
   The nutrient concentration changes in "blank" cores were low in both
   treatments with few exceptions. The methodology developed in the present
   work including the experimental set up and the experimental design is
   proposed to be used for the clarification of the effects of different
   environmental factors on nutrient fluxes between sediment and water
   column in coastal marine ecosystems.

AB During the last decade, in many European countries and cities,
   area-based Urban Development Programmes have been initiated, in response
   to major problems of poverty and social exclusion. Urban Development
   Programmes are usually developed in a complex interplay between
   different governmental levels, and implemented by a wide variety of
   public and non-public parties. This paper addresses the organisation of
   these programmes, concentrating in particular on the form and extent of
   `public-public partnership', i.e. on the role that the different levels
   of the public administration play, both through the administrative
   system and through policy-making. The `empirical' basis for the paper
   consists of case studies, derived from the UGIS project (`Urban
   Governance, Social Inclusion and Sustainability,' a research project
   financed by the European Commission, DG RTD). The short analysis makes
   clear that both the model of public administration, in terms of the
   extent and form of decentralisation, and the presence (or lack) of a
   national policy framework determine the extent to which UDPs can be
   planned, approved and implemented at the local level. One of the main
   findings is that the central influence over UDPs depends more on the
   urban policy framework of the central government than on the model of
   public administration of a country. Countries with strong national
   (regional) urban policies, sufficient decentralisation of public
   administration to the municipal level and the use of governance methods
   at the local level open up possibilities for successful UDPs. Without
   upper-level urban policy frameworks UDPs might be successful as well,
   but their replicability and the control over their external effects will
   not be ensured.

   dissemination of earlier, more reliable information on new and emerging
   trends to enable timely and more effective interventions by policy
   makers and practitioners in the drug and alcohol field. The Fore Var
   system triangulates and cross-references a wide range of statistical and
   quantitative data including seizures data, treatment figures, alcohol
   sales and a school survey, with information from a number of 'leading
   edge' or sensitive data sources, including Internet sites, youth and
   local media, cultural mapping and key informants. Data is collected from
   sources every six months, analysed for identifiable patterns and trends
   and disseminated widely. This paper details the system's developmental
   stages and methodologies, in addition to summarizing results from the
   first three Fore Var reports. In conclusion, the strengths and

AB Background: A recent report showed that Australian veterans of the 1991
   Gulf War displayed a greater prevalence of a multitude of self-reported
   symptoms than a randomly sampled comparison group of military personnel
   who were eligible for deployment but were not deployed to the Gulf.
   Aims: To investigate whether the pattern, rather than frequency, of
   symptom reporting in these Australian Gulf War veterans differed from
   that of the comparison group personnel.
   Methods: Factor analysis was used to determine whether the co-occurrence
   of 62 symptoms in 1322 male Gulf War veterans can be explained by a
   number of underlying dimensions, called factors. The methodology was
   also applied to 1459 male comparison group subjects and the factor
   solutions of the two groups were compared.
   Results: For the Gulf War veterans, a three factor solution displayed
   replicability and construct validity. The three factors were labelled as
   psycho-physiological distress, somatic distress, and arthroneuromuscular
   distress, and were broadly similar to those described in previous
   studies of Gulf War veterans. A concordant three factor solution was
   also found for the comparison group subjects, with strong convergence of
   the factor loadings and factor scores across the two groups being
   displayed.
   Conclusion: Results did not display evidence of a unique pattern of
   self-reported symptoms among Gulf War veterans. Results also indicated
   that the differences between the groups lie in the degrees of expression
   of the three underlying factors, consistent with the well documented
   evidence of increased self-reported symptom prevalence in Gulf War
   veterans.

AB In the last two decades, a number of attempts have been made to unravel
   the complex genetic background of alcohol dependence. There is evidence
   from family, twin and adoption studies that the contribution of genetic
   factors accounts for 40-60% of alcohol dependence. In humans, the main
   approaches for investigating the complex genetics of alcoholism are
   linkage and association studies. Linkage studies reported alcoholism to
   be linked to only 5 chromosomal regions (on chromosomes 1, 7, and
   possibly 2, 4 and 5) and none of those loci reached a high statistical
   significance. Association studies are conducted by numerous research
   groups. They test a potential relationship between a certain genetic
   variant and alcoholism in a design similar to the classical case-control
   studies. Polymorphisms in the GABAergic, serotonergic, dopaminergic, and
   glutamatergic system have been related to alcohol- or alcohol
   ism-associated phenotypes. Many studies failed to confirm initial
   positive results, raising doubts on the validity and replicability of
   this study approach. Recently more research has been conducted using
   genetic microarrays to investigate expression patterns of genes under
   the influence of chronic alcohol consumption. However, these approaches
   have several shortcomings, in particular their applicability in humans.
   In short, approaches in use for years by many research groups such as
   linkage and association studies showed either controversial or
   disappointing results. New approaches using endophenotypes and genetic
   microarrays may be helpful to shed light more light on the complex
   genetic background of alcoholism.

   diffraction theory to couple light of a nearly monochromatic LED into a
   thin planar light guide on the bottom side. The theoretical coupling
   efficiencies for ring-shaped and radial gratings are 41% and 66%,
   respectively. Optimized diffractive elements are manufactured with
   direct electron-beam lithography and reactive-ion-etching into SiO2
   substrates. Good agreement between experimental and theoretical results
   for selected radial gratings is reached. Furthermore, the mass
   production tests using injection molding are carried out with good
   replicability. (C) 2004 Optical Society of America.

AB The present article presents a tutorial on how to estimate and interpret
   various effect sizes. The 5th edition of the Publication Manual of the
   American Psychological Association (2001) described the failure to
   report effect sizes as a "defect" (p. 5), and 23 journals have published
   author guidelines requiring effect size reporting. Although dozens of
   effect size statistics have been available for some time, many
   researchers were trained at a time when effect sizes were not
   emphasized, or perhaps even taught. Consequently, some readers may
   appreciate a review of how to estimate and interpret various effect
   sizes. In addition to the tutorial, the authors recommend effect size
   interpretations that emphasize direct and explicit comparisons of
   effects in a new study with those reported in the prior related
   literature, with a focus on evaluating result replicability.

AB Injection molding could be used as a mass production technology for
   microlens arrays. It is of importance, and thus of our concern in the
   present study, to understand the injection molding processing condition
   effects on the replicability of microlens array profile. Extensive
   experiments were performed by varying processing conditions such as flow
   rate, packing pressure and packing time for three different polymeric
   materials (PS, PMMA and PC). The nickel mold insert of microlens arrays
   was made by electroplating a microstructure master fabricated by a
   modified LIGA process. Effects of processing conditions on the
   replicability were investigated with the help of the surface profile
   measurements. Experimental results showed that a packing pressure and a
   flow rate significantly affects a final surface profile of the injection
   molded product. Atomic force microscope measurement indicated that the
   averaged surface roughness value of injection molded microlens arrays is
   smaller than that of mold insert and is comparable with that of fine
   optical components in practical use.

   (issues inherent with the animal models, the condition of the animal

   accurately. This chapter provides background information about ageing
   research and animal models in general and arms readers with guidelines
   they can use to assist them when analyzing reports of ageing research
   using those models. The article also uses the guidelines to briefly
   evaluate three anti-ageing treatment candidates: one in the very early
   stages of testing (resveratrol), one that has been proven unfounded as
   an anti-ageing intervention by testing [dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)]
   and one that has undergone testing successfully (L-deprenyl).

AB The actuarial Violence Risk Appraisal Guide (VRAG) was developed for
   male offenders where it has shown excellent replicability in many new
   forensic samples using officially recorded outcomes. Clinicians also
   make decisions, however about the risk of interpersonal violence posed
   by nonforensic psychiatric patients of both sexes. Could an actuarial
   risk assessment developed for male forensic populations be used for a
   broader clientele? We modified the VRAG to permit evaluation using data
   from the MacArthur Violence Risk Assessment Study that included
   nonforensic male and female patients and primarily self-reported
   violence. The modified VRAG yielded a large effect size in the
   prediction of dichotomous postdischarge severe violence over 20 and 50
   weeks. Accuracy of VRAG predictions was unrelated to sex. The results
   provide evidence about the robustness of comprehensive actuarial risk
   assessments and the generality of the personal factors that underlie
   violent behavior.

   three subscales of the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and to
   study the pattern of associations between the TAS-20 scales,
   neuroticism, and alexithymia. Methods: Two clinical and three
   nonclinical samples were included in the cross-sectional part of the
   study. One clinical and one nonclinical sample also participated in the
   6-month follow-up study. To test the replicability of the three-factor
   structure of the TAS-20 across samples, a principal component analysis
   was conducted, followed by a Procrustes rotation. Linear regression
   analyses were conducted to examine temporal stability and to determine
   the specificity of the associations among the TAS-20 scales,
   neuroticism, and extraversion. Results: The three-factor structure of
   the TAS-20 was confirmed across all five samples. With a few exceptions,
   neuroticism and extraversion attained a higher level of temporal
   stability than the alexithymia scales. The TAS-subscale measuring
   difficulty identifying feelings (DIF) was less stable in the clinical
   than in the nonclinical sample. Neuroticism was most strongly associated
   with DIF, whereas extraversion was mainly related to externally oriented
   thinking (EOT). A combination of both neuroticism and extraversion was
   the best predictor of difficulty describing feelings (DDF). Conclusions:
   Future studies on the psychometric properties and the clinical value of
   the TAS-20 should pay more attention to its subscales. Especially the
   EOT facet needs further examination. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   cancer were enrolled. Phase one was performed by using two pieces of
   tissue biopsy from different-locations in the tumor from each patient.
   The IMD value was counted by the two pathologists after counterstaining
   by Factor VIII immunohistochemical method. No interobserver disagreement
   between the two pathologists was found (correlation coefficient = 0.92,
   95% CI 0.82-0.96 for the first piece of tissue and 0.85, 95% CI
   0.67-0.93 for the second piece). There was no variability in the IMD
   between the 2 pieces of tissue specimens from different locations of the
   tumor. Phase two followed to evaluate the relationship between IMD and
   clinical outcome in individual cervical cancer patients. Because of the
   small sample size, different patients 'characteristics, different
   treatment protocol and short term follow up, there is no statistically
   significant conclusion.

   analysis produced a two-factor structure corresponding to self-deceptive

   and related individual validity scales were elevated among research
   participants instructed to fake good on the MMPI-2 as compared with

AB Analysis of soil lipids may contribute to an improved understanding of
   atmosphere to soil carbon fluxes, soil organic matter source
   differentiation and pollutant accumulation. Soil lipids, mostly
   originating from plants and microorganisms, have traditionally been
   analysed by non-automated extraction and separation methods, which
   produce several lipid fractions, operationally defined by polarity. Here
   we present a combination of fast, automated and reproducible techniques,
   adopted from organic geochemical studies, for preparative separation of
   individual soil lipid fractions with increasing polarity. These
   techniques involve commercially available instruments, including
   accelerated solvent extraction and a two-step automated medium-pressure
   liquid chromatography procedure. The method yields eight lipid fractions
   consisting of five fractions fully amenable to gas chromatography/mass
   spectrometry (GC/MS) (aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons,
   ketones, alcohols, carboxylic acids), and three fractions of highly
   polar or high molecular weight compounds (bases, very long-chain wax
   esters (C40(+)), high polarity compounds) that were not measurable with
   GC/MS under standard conditions. We tested the method on five
   agricultural soils. Results show that (i) mass recoveries for the
   individual fractions are reproducible, (ii) within individual fractions
   compound distribution patterns are reproducible, as demonstrated for
   alkanes and carboxylic acids, and (iii) individual fractions represent
   distinct and clean compound classes, free of interfering substances
   detectable by GC/MS. Thus, automated separation can be a fast, effective
   and reproducible procedure for fractionation of complex mixtures of soil
   lipids into clean compound classes, directly suitable for a variety of
   molecular (e.g. GC/MS) and isotopic characterizations (e.g. gas
   chromatography coupled with isotope ratio monitoring mass spectrometry
   or accelerator mass spectrometry).

AB Concerns surrounding possible future climate change, sea level rise, and
   their potential impacts on coastal environments, have stimulated
   research seeking to elucidate the relationship between ocean levels and
   climate at the (sub)century-scale. The need for increasingly precise
   reconstructions of relative sea-level change has, in-turn, driven the
   development of new methodologies capable of resolving fine-scale
   variability within salt-marsh sedimentary sequences. The use of
   salt-marsh foraminifera, as precise indicators of past tide levels has
   played a central role in this process and is exemplified by a number of
   detailed studies conducted in Connecticut, USA. In this paper, we apply
   the most recent methodological advance in the reconstruction of relative
   sea-levels using salt-marsh foraminifera. We develop a foraminiferal
   transfer function for tide level, derived from the modem foraminiferal
   distributions of four Connecticut salt-marshes.
   In contrast to existing approaches that employ site-specific
   interpolations of local vertical foraminiferal assemblage zones, this
   transfer function can provide objective, quantitative and reproducible
   estimates of palacomarsh-surface elevation with explicitly stated error
   terms for marshes throughout Connecticut, irrespective of differences in
   tidal range.
   We demonstrate the foraminiferal transfer function approach by employing
   it to reconstruct changes in palaeomarsh-surface elevation from three
   cores recovered from Hammock River marsh, Connecticut. The resulting
   reconstructions, which are precise to +/- 0.09 m, are tested using an
   independent dataset from the neighbouring state of Maine, and are used
   to assess a pivotal record of mean high water (MHW) change from this
   site. We conclude that the transfer function reconstructions show good
   general agreement with previous records of palaeomarsh-surface
   elevation, but with the advantages of quantified error terms and a
   transparent, reproducible methodology. This replicability will assist in
   the comparison or combination of local records of MHW change to infer
   large-scale, regional sea-level variations. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Many studies have shown a positive relationship between elevated
   dispositional self-focus and emotional disorder. Trapnell and Campbell
   (1999) proposed that this relationship was only true for ruminative
   forms of self-focus, reflective self-focus being associated with
   psychological health. The present study aimed: (1) to examine the
   replicability of Trapnell and Campbell's (1999) questionnaire-based
   differentiation of reflective and ruminative dispositional self-focus;
   (2) to see whether reflection and rumination could also be
   differentiated using measures of autobiographical memory; (3) to see
   whether such memory measures could elucidate mechanisms underlying
   different forms of dispositional self-focus. 130 volunteers retrieved
   autobiographical memories to neutral cue words and completed
   questionnaires. Questionnaires differentiated reflection and rumination:
   reflection correlated with openness to experience, whereas rumination
   correlated with neuroticism, replicating previous findings that it is
   specifically ruminative self-focus that is maladaptive. Memory measures
   also differentiated reflection and rumination: reflection was unrelated
   to the affective qualities of memories, whereas rumination correlated
   with measures of the happiness, unhappiness and at-oneness of memories.
   Dispositional ruminative self-focus, like neuroticism, was specifically
   related to increased accessibility of memories of events where
   individuals felt "not at all at-one with things". This style of memory
   access could underpin dispositional ruminative self-focus, which is
   closely linked to neuroticism. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB With the proliferation of commercial experiment generators and custom
   software within cognitive psychology and the behavioral sciences, many
   have assumed that issues regarding millisecond tinting accuracy have
   been largely solved. However, through empirical investigation of a
   variety of paradigms, we have discovered numerous sources of timing
   error. These can range from poor scripting practices, to incorrect
   tinting specifications, to hardware variability. Building upon earlier
   research, we have developed a commercial device and associated software
   that enables researchers to benchmark most computer-based paradigms in
   situ and without modification. This gives them the opportunity to
   correct tinting errors where practicable, increase replicability, and
   reduce variability by altering onset times for stimuli, by replacing
   inaccurate hardware, or by post hoc statistical manipulation should the
   source of error be constant. We outline the features of the device and
   accompanying software suite, stress the importance of such independent
   validation, and highlight typical areas that can be subject to error.

   and AD. While most positive results were largely contradictory, we
   identified three loci-on chromosomes 6p2l, 10q24, 11q23-that yielded
   positive results in three or more independent studies, in addition to
   the well-established AD association with the gene encoding
   apolipoprotein E (APOE). Based on these data, we suggest that it may be
   prudent for investigators to pay closer attention to issues such as
   power, replicability and haplotype structure prior to initial
   publication. This should serve to greatly decrease the likelihood of
   false positive and false negative findings reported in future years.

AB Background. Numerous studies have employed the Delphi technique to seek
   expert opinion about aspects of clinical practice. When researching
   literature on the Delphi technique, however, we discovered discrepancies
   in its application, and a lack of detail when reporting design,
   administration, and analysis methods. Such lack of specificity hinders
   the replicability and assessment of the clinical and cultural validity
   and reliability of Delphi studies.
   Aim. The aim of this paper is to detail the practical application of the
   Delphi technique as a culturally and clinically valid means of accessing
   expert opinion on the importance of clinical criteria.
   Methods. Reference is made to a bicultural New Zealand mental health
   nursing clinical indicator study that employed a three-round reactive
   Delphi survey. Equal proportions of Maori and non-Maori nurses (n = 20)
   and consumers (n = 10) rated the importance of 91 clinical indicator
   statements for the achievement of professional practice standards.
   Additional statements (n = 21) suggested by Delphi participants in round
   1 were included in subsequent rounds. In round 2, participants explained
   the rating they applied to statements that had not reached consensus in
   round 1, and summarized responses were provided to participants in round
   3. Consensus was considered to have been achieved if 85% of round 3
   ratings lay within a 2-point bracket on the 5-point Likert-scale
   overall, or in one of the Maori nurse, non-Maori nurse, or consumer
   groups. A mean rating of 4.5 after round 3 was set as the importance
   threshold.
   Findings. Consensus occurred overall on 75 statements, and within groups
   on another 24. Most statements (n = 86) reached the importance
   benchmark.
   Conclusions. When rigorous methods of participant selection, group
   composition, participant feedback, and determination of consensus and
   importance are employed, the Delphi technique is a reliable,
   cost-effective means of obtaining and prioritizing experts judgements.

AB Science means not just 'knowing', but knowing verified by replicability.
   Science is particularly hard to bring to depth psychology because the
   individual uniquenesses that can't be repeated are what make people most
   deeply themselves. Everyone, including the analytic investigator,
   however, has a science, in the sense of a world-view that is replicated
   by experience. Jung offered hermeneutics as an alternative mode to
   science for getting to know the psychological subject. But as Heidegger
   emphasized, hermeneutics always begins with the projection of a
   world-view, i.e., the science of the would-be interpreter. In the
   analytic situation, dialogue is available to test the world-view and
   enlarge its horizon, in accord with Gadamer's expansion of hermeneutics,
   'the classical discipline concerned with the art of understanding
   texts', into a method of inquiry open to the possibilities of otherness.
   An example is given from an analytic training seminar, in which the
   author began by projecting his version of the theory of psychological
   types onto the dream material a candidate offered in response to the
   seminar. A dialogue with the candidate ensued which enabled the teacher
   to correct his original, somewhat rigid, application of his scientific
   viewpoint. In such a dialogue, psyche emerges as the final interpreter
   of what is, generating hypotheses that can fruitfully be applied to the
   understanding of other cases.

AB Certain premises of the self-verification model of depression and
   interpersonal rejection (joiner, 2000; Swann, Wenzlaff, Krull, & Pelham,
   1992) were examined in a sample of heterosexual dating couples (N = 67).
   This study builds upon previous research by examining (a) the
   replicability of model effects within a long-term, meaningful
   relationship context; (b) the specificity of association between
   depressive symptoms and negative feedback-seeking, over and above
   self-esteem; and (c) the potential mediating effects of negative
   feedback-seeking on the association between depressive symptomatology
   and rejection. Overall, findings supported the components of the
   self-verification model, and indicated that these effects may be
   generalizable to more meaningful relationship contexts. Although the
   mediational hypothesis was not supported, results suggested that
   rejection effects in depression might be better explained by
   relationship satisfaction.

AB The event-related optical signal (EROS) uses near-infrared light to
   study changes in neuronal optical properties in response to stimuli and
   endogenous events. EROS responses to electrical stimulation of the
   median nerve at 1, 5, and 8 Hz were collected from 80 channels in 7
   subjects. Optical recording channels were spatially aligned by
   co-registering the digitized fiber locations with structural magnetic
   resonance images (MRI) for each subject separately. The co-registered
   data sets were then transformed into Talairach space to permit allgnment
   across subjects. After alignment, data from channels underlying pixels
   of a surface projection were combined to produce maps of Z statistics.
   Waveforms associated with voxels within an a priori region of interest
   (ROI) over the hand area of primary somatosensory (SI) cortex were
   compared across the three stimulus frequencies. Reliable early increases
   in light propagation time (i.e., increased phase delay) were found in SI
   as early as 16-32 ms of poststimulus for all three frequency conditions,
   and both an increase in phase delay and a decrease in signal intensity
   were observed over SI at longer latencies. A split-half analysis of the
   8 Hz condition demonstrated the replicability of the response. This
   represents the first direct comparison of intensity and delay measures
   of these components of the somatosensory response; further, it shows
   that these early cortical components are replicable across subjects and
   correspond wen to individual subjects' anatomical landmarks for SI. (C)

AB The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) has explicitly promoted

   the only legitimate educational science. In doing so, the law seeks to
   remodel educational research in a medical mode. This article draws on
   the narrative of a human subject participating in a medical randomized
   experiment to raise questions about the extent to which such designs
   secure the goals NCLB claims they will: validity, rigor, replicability.
   In contrasting the narrative of science in NCLB and the narrative of
   science as told by human subjects, the author draws on de Certeau as
   well as Bowker and Star to make sense of the difference in structure of
   the narratives and to highlight the extent to which randomized designs

AB This article reports an extension of the Carnegie Mellon risk-ranking
   method to incorporate ecological risks and their attributes. On the
   basis of earlier risk-perception studies, we identified a set of 20
   relevant attributes for describing health, safety, and environmental
   hazards in standardized risk summary sheets. In a series of three
   ranking sessions, 23 laypeople ranked 10 such hazards in a fictional
   Midwestern U.S. county using both holistic and multiattribute ranking
   procedures. Results were consistent with those from previous studies
   involving only health and safety hazards, providing additional evidence
   for the validity of the method and the replicability of the resulting
   rankings. Holistic and multiattribute risk rankings were reasonably
   consistent both for individuals and for groups. Participants reported
   that they were satisfied with the procedures and results, and indicated
   their support for using the method to advise real-world risk-management
   decisions. Agreement among participants increased over the course of the
   exercise, perhaps because the materials and deliberations helped
   participants to correct their misconceptions and clarify their values.
   Overall, health and safety attributes were judged more important than
   environmental attributes. However, the overlap between the importance
   rankings of these two sets of attributes suggests that some information
   about environmental impacts is important to participants' judgments in
   comparative risk-assessment tasks.

AB Objective: Complex trait mapping has been widely used to analyze the
   genetics of behavior However, the approach has some disadvantages,
   including poor gene localization and low replicability. Genome-tagged
   mice (GTMs) are sets of congenic mouse strains that span the entire
   mouse genome and are a promising reagent for localization of genes
   contributing to behavior Methods: In order to map behavioral loci of
   interest, a GTM was investigated in which the middle region of
   Chromosome 1 from DBA/2J was introgressed onto a C57BL/6J background.
   The GTM was analyzed for behaviors related to sensorimotor getting,
   anxiety, depression, pain sensitivity, and learning and memory. Results:
   The GTM was found to harbor a locus contributing to learning and memory
   replicating results from complex trait analysis. Conclusions: The GTMs
   should be a valuable resource for mapping and confirmation of loci
   contributing to complex behavioral traits in the mouse, with ultimate
   implications for human genomic-based research, as well.

AB Consulting and scholarly research often have very different objectives
   with respect to advancements in practice, theory, and observation (e.g.,
   data collections). For example, consulting often emphasizes immediate
   benefits, specialized applications, and a focus on only the key
   variables. Scholarly research often emphasizes replicability
   generalizability, and introducing previously uninvestigated variables.
   However, these activities complement each other, and each activity is
   important for the advancement of the other. Benefiting from that
   complementarity requires the literature to bridge knowledge gained from
   each activity. It is unnecessary for every researcher to try to bridge
   theory and practice by working on the interface between academics and
   practice. However, it is critical that some researchers do so. This
   issue of Marketing Science examines several excellent applications of
   Marketing Science that provide detailed microexaminations of the
   fundamental marketing practices that we seek to understand and improve.
   Beyond demonstrating how to solve specific problems in practice, in my
   opinion, the articles and commentaries in this issue also illustrate at
   least the following ideas: Short-term tactics can produce significant
   short-term advantages. Existing models in the literature can be useful
   with proper implementation. State-of-the-art research is most useful for
   infrequent decisions. Finally, knowing the decision-making context is
   essential for determining which variables to include in the analysis.

   interest (ROIs) were measured on magnetic resonance images of 200
   healthy adults. The strength of association between age and volume
   differed across ROIs. The lateral prefrontal cortex exhibited the
   greatest age-related differences, whereas significantly weaker
   associations were observed in the prefrontal white matter,
   sensory-motor, and visual association regions. The hippocampal shrinkage
   was significant in people in their mid-fifties. The primary visual,
   anterior cingulate, the inferior parietal cortices, and the parietal
   white matter showed no age-related differences. The pattern of
   age-related regional differences replicated the findings previously
   obtained on an independent sample drawn from the same population. Men
   evidenced larger volumes in all ROIs except the inferior parietal
   lobule, even after sexual dimorphism in body size was statistically
   controlled. In some regions (hippocampus and fusiform gyrus) men
   exhibited steeper negative age-related trends than women. Although a
   typical pattern of global hemispheric asymmetry was observed, the
   direction and magnitude of regional volumetric asymmetry was as
   inconsistent as in the previous reports. Thus, a pattern of age-related
   shrinkage suggesting increased vulnerability of the lateral prefrontal
   cortex to aging appears stable and replicable, whereas little
   consistency exists in sex-related and hemispheric differences in
   regional cortical volumes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   being a valuable non invasive tool for presurgical mapping of sensory

   protocol (CSSMP), where external mechanic stimulation serves as a cue
   for voluntary movements, allows the, recording of sensory and motor
   cortical responses during a single activation task. The stability and
   replicability of MEG-derived recordings during this paradigm were tested
   in a group of eight neurologically normal volunteers and six patients
   with perirolandic lesions. We found that a common sensorimotor cortical
   network, engaging sensory (SI, S2) and motor (M1) areas, was reliably
   activated in all subjects and patients and that the results remained
   exceptionally stable over time. Additionally, the clinical validity of
   the MEG-derived maps of activation was tested through intraoperative
   electrocortical stimulation mapping in the group of patients. The
   MEG-derived anatomical maps for specific sensory (S1) and motor (M1)
   responses were verified, by direct cortical mapping, and confirmed with
   the patient's surgical outcome. The results of this validation study
   show that the so-called CSSMP is a reliable and reproducible method for
   assessing simultaneously sensory and motor areas. This method minimizes
   methodological problems and improves our knowledge of the spatiotemporal
   organization of the sensorimotor cortical network and helps to optimize
   the surgical management of patients with perirolandic lesions. (C) 2004

AB This article analyses the strategies of the agro-biotechnology industry
   to control and exploit plant-genetic knowledge, and the dilemmas that
   these strategies involve. The replicability of plants limits markets for
   commercial seeds, as it enables farmers to reproduce seeds themselves.
   The industry has therefore invented genetic-engineering techniques that
   will block the replicability of plants, and will effectively prevent
   farmers from saving their own seeds. However, this copy-protection
   technique-dubbed 'Terminator'-is widely condemned in farming
   communities. The technology overrules intellectual property lairs that
   exempt seed saving for private use, and it is likely to have a negative
   impact on medium-sized and small farming systems in developing
   countries. In this article it is argued that while copy protection in
   plants may expand seed markets, it may also seriously damage the
   reputation of the biotechnology industry. Corporate scientists and
   strategists should be more open to a public discussion about the
   fairness and legitimacy of seed production for private use.

AB Comorbid depression is frequent in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
   and is acknowledged as a major confound in biological and neurocognitive
   investigations in OCD. The aim of the present study was to assess the
   distribution of depressive symptoms in a large OCD sample (n = 162) and
   to analyze the dimensional structure of the Hamilton Depression Rating
   Scale (HDRS) in OCD. Major depressive disorder according to DSM-IV
   criteria was apparent in approximately one third of the patients.
   Frequent symptoms were depressed mood, reduced ability to work, anxiety
   symptoms and guilt feelings. HDRS scores were submitted to a
   varimax-rotated factor analysis. In accordance with studies conducted
   with depressed samples, multi-dimensional solutions suggesting three to
   six factors emerged. Subsequent confirmatory factor analysis revealed
   satisfactory fit indices for a four-factorial solution comprising core
   depressive symptoms, sleep disturbance, anxiety and gastrointestinal
   problems. Aggression-related obsessions as well as the overall severity
   of obsessions were related to core depressive symptoms. Anxiety symptoms
   were associated with excessive rituals. Greater recognition of
   depressive sub-components may help to raise the replicability of
   empirical findings in OCD research as there is evidence from both
   depression and OCD samples that distinct depressive syndromes have
   different biological correlates. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

   knowledge, consecutive p latinization and polymerization of pyrrole is
   firstly used for surface modification.
   Successful experimental results have been achieved for glucose
   detection. It has several advantages, such as smaller sensitive surface
   area (1 mm x 1 min), lower detection limit (1 x 10(-4) M), broader
   linear range (1 x 10(-4)-1 x 10(-2) M), larger sensitive coefficient
   (39.640 nA(.)mm(-2.)mM(-1)), better replicability (RSD 3.2% for five
   respective detections) and stability (sensitive coefficient remains well
   above 95% after being stored in a clean container at room temperature
   for a month), easier to be made into arrays and to be integrated with
   processing circuitry, etc.

AB Empirical research in learning algorithms for classification tasks
   generally requires the use of significance tests. The quality of a test
   is typically judged on Type I error (how often the test indicates a
   difference when it should not) and Type 11 error (how often it indicates
   no difference when it should). In this paper we argue that the
   replicability of a test is also of importance. We say that a test has
   low replicability if its outcome strongly depends on the particular
   random partitioning of the data that is used to perform it. We present
   empirical measures of replicability and use them to compare the
   performance of several popular tests in a realistic setting involving
   standard learning algorithms and benchmark datasets. Based on our
   results we give recommendations on which test to use.

   showed excellent agreement between references NCHS and MUST et al; good

AB The study of patterns in personality structure reveals three replicable
   prototypes: Resilients, Overcontrollers, and Undercontrollers. The three
   prototypes were first identified in children using ratings based on the
   California Child Q-set (see Block, 1971). Only recently, the three
   prototypes were replicated in self-reports on questionnaires intended to
   assess the Big Five (see e.g. Asendorpf, Borkenau, Ostendorf, & van
   Aken, 2001). This paper addresses the question of whether the three
   prototypes are replicable across different data sources. Cluster
   structures in self-, peer, and behaviour ratings, all based on the Big
   Five, were examined in a sample of 600 monozygotic and dizygotic twins
   ranging in age from 18 to 70 years. The three prototypes could be
   clearly identified in the self-reports only, whereas in ratings by
   others only the Resilient prototype could be replicated. In both peer
   and behaviour ratings, the second and the third cluster reflected a
   Non-desirable and an Average type. The analysis of cross-data
   consistency revealed only moderate agreement in assignments of
   individual subjects to types. The findings suggest that personality
   types depend strongly on personality measures and informants. Copyright

AB An important question in trait theory is how many traits are necessary
   to describe personality and exactly what traits these are. Several
   investigators have made attempts to answer these questions with
   solutions of 3, 5, and even 16 primary factors. The Zuckerman-Kuhlman
   Personality Questionnaire (ZKPQ) is a questionnaire aimed at the
   evaluation of a five-factor model, which emerged from factor analyses of
   scales and items. The results were five basic factors, similar in men
   and women: Neuroticism-Anxiety, Activity, Sociability, Impulsive
   Sensation-Seeking, and Aggression-Hostility. This study assesses the
   psychometric properties of the Catalan translation of the ZKPQ. The ZKPQ
   was administered to a total sample of 933 subjects with an age range
   from 17 to 25 years. The results obtained show good internal consistency
   of all the scales and good discriminant validity shown by the lack of
   correlation among scales. Gender differences are also in the predicted
   directions. Finally, the replicability of the original five-component
   structure was also demonstrated. The present findings show this Catalan
   version to be a reliable tool for research in the field of personality
   structure and demonstrate the cross-cultural reliability of the factor
   structure developed from American subjects.

AB Bargh, Chaiken, Raymond, and Hymes (1996) and Hermans, De Houwer, and
   Eelen (1994) showed that a valenced target word is pronounced faster
   after the presentation of an affectively related prime word than after
   the presentation of an affectively unrelated prime word. This finding is
   important because it provides crucial evidence for the hypotheses that
   stimulus evaluation (a) is goal-independent and (b) facilitates the
   encoding of stimuli that have the same valence. However, recent studies
   indicate that the affective priming effect is not a reliable finding in
   the standard pronunciation task. We report the results of a nearly exact
   replication of Bargh et al.'s (1996) Experiment 2. In line with previous
   replication studies, we failed to detect the affective priming effect.

AB As the intake routes and hazards to human health of heavy metals were
   well recognized, therefore the intake amount of heavy metal through
   foodchain ahs been effectively controlled and cut down. In many cases,
   oral ingested soil has become an important source of heavy metals in
   human. The traditional approach for estimating the bioavailability of
   heavy metals in oral ingested soil was animal(in vivo)test. Compared
   with animal test, in vitro test possesses several advantages including
   satisfactory replicability, time and cost effectiveness. Also, the
   results of in vitro tests showed well correlation to those of in vitro
   tests. The progress of development, current status and the methodology
   of in vitro test could be used not only to estimate the bioavailability
   of heavy metals in soil in order to provide information for
   establishement of soil quality or clean-up criteria with regard to human
   health, but also to evaluate the effectiveness of soil remediation
   technologies. The in vitro test ahs been employed in many developed
   countries due to its above mentioned advantages. The use of in vitro
   test for screening of contaminated soil and evaluating the effectivenss
   of remediation technology is believed to be promising.

AB A new silicon-based amperometric microelectrode biosensor made with bulk
   micromachining technology is provided. We designed this new biosensor
   and fabricated it with anisotropic silicon wet etching technique. P-type
   silicon wafers, Au and SU-8 are used for making substrate,
   microelectrode and micro reaction pool respectively. To our knowledge,
   consecutive platinization and polymerization of pyrrole is firstly used
   consecutively for microelectrode surface modification. The sensor aims
   for low unit cost, small dimensions and compatibility with CMOS
   technology. SU-8 micro reaction pools are made to contain detection
   solution to reduce reagent volume and unit cost. Bulk micromachining,
   platinization and polymerization of pyrrole enhance sensitive
   coefficient, thus helping to miniaturize its dimensions and to reduce
   unit cost. Using p-type silicon wafers as substrates make compatibility
   with CMOS technology possible. Successful experimental results have been
   achieved for glucose detection. Compared to conventional amperometric
   biosensors and amperometric microelectrode biosensors made with surface
   micromachining technology, it has several advantages, such as smaller
   sensing surface area (1 mm times 1 mm), lower detection limit (1times10
   -4 M), larger sensitive coefficient (39.640 nA mM -1 mm -2), broader
   linear range (1times10 -4-1times -2 M), better replicability (3.2% RSD
   for five respective detections) and stability (enzyme efficiency remains
   well above 95% after being stored for a month), easier to be made into
   arrays and to be integrated with processing circuitry, etc.

   planning in watershed management is questioned for its effective and
   long-term based implementation. Participatory land use planning has been
   introduced and applied in mountainous watershed management by
   international organizations in China in the recent years, with
   combination of "bottom-up" and "top-down" approach. This paper reviews
   the field experiments and practices of participatory land use planning
   in terms of its framework, processes, methodologies and tools, etc. and
   has discussions focusing on its adaptability to local situations and
   replicability in the broad mountain areas of China. It is concluded that
   participatory land use planning is a sound approach to sustainable

AB Following a suggestion from Greenwald, Gonzalez, Harris, and Guthrie
   (1996), Posavac (2002) developed an approach to estimate the probability
   that replications of completed studies would be statistically
   significant. We argue that this approach is faulty because it is based
   on the unjustifiably restrictive assumption that the effect size
   observed in the initial study is the population effect size. Using the
   noncentral t distribution and methods presented by Cumming and Finch
   (2001), we construct a confidence interval for the observed effect size.
   Boundaries of that confidence interval are used to compute the limits of
   plausible replicability (post hoc power) values. It is demonstrated that
   the possible values span an impractically large range, rendering the
   post hoc analysis of replicability without merit. These issues are
   discussed in the broader context of post hoc power analyses.

AB Outdoor stream mesocosm studies conducted between 1992 and 1996 at two
   facilities enabled the investigation of structural variability in
   invertebrate assemblages within and between studies. Temporal
   variability of benthic invertebrate assemblages between eight replicate
   streams within a study was assessed in a 28-day mesocosm study without
   chemical treatment. Cluster analysis, non-metric multidimensional
   scaling, and principal component analysis each showed the untreated
   assemblages as structurally distinct groups on the three sampling days.
   The assemblages between the eight replicate streams showed > 88%
   Bray-Curtis similarity at any one time during the study. In addition,
   pre-treatment data from a series of four studies conducted at one
   facility were used to examine structural variability in the starting
   benthic invertebrate assemblages between studies. Invertebrate
   assemblages were structurally distinct at the start of each mesocosm
   study conducted in different years at the same facility and the taxa
   responsible for differences in the assemblages were also different each
   year. The implications of temporal and spatial variability in benthic
   invertebrate assemblages within and between mesocosm studies with
   regards to species sensitivity and study repeatability should be
   considered when results of such studies are used in risk assessment. (C)

AB The various biological and engineering measures for soil and water
   conservation in India are reviewed. Results of combined bioengineering
   technologies aimed at achieving increased improvement in erosion control
   are presented. Keeping in mind rainfall, agroclimatic niche and
   requirements of local communities, vegetative barriers can be used in
   agricultural situations on slopes of up to 4%. On slopes up to 9 or 10%,
   especially in high rainfall zones, vegetative barriers need to be
   augmented with structural measures. At the other extreme, expensive
   terrace formations can cope with slopes of up to 60%, provided there is
   sufficient soil depth to warrant construction. Protection by field
   bunds, terrace risers and drainage line treatments, even on steeper
   slopes, can be achieved by engineering methods when supplemented with
   the appropriate vegetation measures. A single species such as vetiver (
   Vetiveria zizanioides) does not necessarily fit into the vast range
   ecological environments found in the Indian subcontinent. Often, locally
   adapted species have been found to perform well in many situations.
   Initially, mechanical measures are frequently essential for creating the
   conditions for quick establishment of vegetation on mass-eroded sites,
   but with time the vegetation will take over the conservation functions
   on a sustainable basis. Cost effectiveness, sustainability and
   replicability of resource-conserving technologies are now being realized
   through participatory processes involving local communities.
   Supply-driven and target-oriented top-down approaches loaded with
   incentives are being replaced by community-driven strategies.

AB Background: The design of appropriate strategies to analyze and
   interpret linkage results for complex human diseases constitutes a
   challenge. Parameters such as power, definition of phenotype, and
   replicability have to be taken into account in order to reach meaningful
   conclusions. Incorporating data on repeated phenotypic measures may
   increase the power to detect linkage but requires sophisticated analysis
   methods. Using the simulated Genetic Analysis Workshop 13 data set, we
   have estimated a variety of systolic blood pressure (SBP) phenotypic
   measures and examined their performance with respect to consistency
   among replicates and to true and false positive linkage signals.
   Results: The whole-genome scan conducted on a dichotomous hypertension
   phenotype indicated the involvement of few true loci with nominal
   significance and gave rise to a high rate of false positives. Analysis
   of a cross-sectional quantitative SBP measure performed better, although
   genome-wide significance was again not reached. Additional phenotypic
   measures were derived from the longitudinal data using random effects
   modelling for censored data with varying levels of covariate adjustment.
   These models provided evidence for significant linkage to most genes
   influencing SBP and produced few false positive results. Overall,
   replicability of results was poor for loci, representing weak effects.
   Conclusion: Longitudinally derived phenotypes performed better than
   cross-sectional measures in linkage analyses. Bearing in mind the sample
   design and size of these data, linkage results that fail to replicate
   should not be dismissed; instead, different lines of evidence derived
   from complementary analysis methods should be combined to prioritize
   follow up.

   that requires further validation. This study examined the replicability
   of differences in clinical symptoms, neurocognitive functioning, affect
   perception, and social functioning previously reported among deficit (n
   = 15) and nondeficit syndrome (n = 30) schizophrenia patients classified
   according to the Schedule for the Deficit Syndrome (SDS; Psychiatry Res.
   30 (1989) 119) and nonpatient controls (n = 41). Additionally,
   participants completed self-report affective trait measures of positive
   affectivity, negative affectivity, and social anhedonia to examine the
   deficit syndrome concept of diminished emotional range. We were able to
   replicate symptom profiles and neurocognitive and social functioning
   impairments in deficit vs. nondeficit patients, but did not find more
   severe affect perception impairment in deficit vs. nondeficit patients
   as previously reported. Regarding range of subjectively experienced
   emotion, deficit patients reported lower trait positive affectivity and
   marginally higher social anhedonia than nondeficit patients and
   controls, but also reported elevations in negative affectivity that were
   similar to nondeficit patients as compared to controls. While
   replication of patterns of impairment across multiple domains of
   functioning supports the validity of the deficit syndrome, results also
   suggest that SDS-defined deficit patients may be characterized by a
   relative reduction in the tendency or ability to experience positive
   emotions, rather than a pervasive diminution in the range of emotional
   experience. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This article reviews the modulation of cognitive function by normal
   genetic variation. Although the heritability of "g" is well established,
   the genes that modulate specific cognitive functions are largely
   unidentified. Application of the allelic association approach to
   individual differences in cognition has begun to reveal the effects of
   single nucleotide polymorphisms on specific and general cognitive
   functions. This article proposes a framework for relating genotype to
   cognitive phenotype by considering the effect of genetic variation on
   the protein product of specific genes within the context of the neural
   basis of particular cognitive domains. Specificity of effects is
   considered, from genes controlling part of one receptor type to genes
   controlling agents of neuronal repair, and evidence is reviewed of
   cognitive modulation by polymorphisms in dopaminergic and cholinergic
   receptor genes, dopaminergic enzyme genes, and neurotrophic genes.
   Although allelic variation in certain genes can be reliably linked to
   cognition--specifically to components of attention, working memory, and
   executive function in healthy adults--the specificity, generality, and
   replicability of the effects are not fully known.

AB No backbone motif other than phospho-ribose and phospho-deoxyribose has

   types of replicable biopolymers to DNA and RNA. With the aim of
   propagating and expressing a third type of nucleic acid in vivo, we
   assessed the replicability of polynucleotides with a phospho-hexitol
   backbone (HNA) in vivo and in vitro. Faithful polymerisation of up to
   four deoxynucleotides templated by hexitol oligonucleotides was
   established in vitro using DNA polymerase from Escherichia coli (PolA
   Klenow exo-fragment) and Thermus aquaticus (Taq polymerase).
   Condensation of up to three successive hTTPs (hexitol thymidine
   triphosphate) in response to a pentameric hexitol template (hA)(5) could
   also be demonstrated in vitro. Such a marginal HNA-dependent HNA
   polymerase activity of natural polymerases may be evolved in the future
   to catalyse in vitro amplification of HNA. The transmission of a
   two-codon-long genetic message carried on a hexameric hexitol template
   was also established using a selection screen for restoring thymidylate
   synthase activity in E. coli. These results exemplify the potential that
   can be explored by converting artificial substrates with natural enzymes
   in the field of informational polymer synthesis. (C) 2003 Published by

AB Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses based on Monte Carlo sampling were

   (PELMO). Analyses were repeated 10 times with different seed numbers.
   The ranking of PELMO input parameters according to their influence on
   predictions for leaching was stable for the most influential parameters.
   For less influential parameters. the sensitivity ranking was severely
   influenced by the seed number used. For uncertainty analyses,
   probabilities of exceeding a particular concentration were significantly
   influenced by the seed number used in the random sampling of values for
   the two parameters considered, even for those cases in which 5,000 model
   runs were undertaken (coefficient of variation of 10 replicated
   analyses. 5%). A decrease in the variability of exceedance probabilities
   Could be achieved by further increasing the number of model runs.
   However, this may prove to be impractical when complex deterministic
   models with a relatively long running time are used. Attention should be
   paid to replicability aspects by modelers when devising their approach
   to assessing the uncertainty associated with the modeling and by
   decision makers when examining the results of probabilistic approaches.

AB Background. Tailored interventions require the identification of
   distinct homogenous subgroups that will benefit from different
   intervention materials. One way to identify such subgroups is to use
   cluster analysis to identify an empirical typology.
   Methods. A sample of 346 adults completed surveys through a telephone
   interview that included questions related to participating in regular
   exercise. The three variables used in the cluster analysis were the Pros
   of Exercise, the Cons of Exercise, and Exercise Self-Efficacy.
   Results. Six resulting clusters were labeled Disengaged, Immotive,
   Relapse Risk, Early Action, Maintainers, and Habituated. A series of
   analyses tested the internal and external validity of the typology. The
   internal validity test revealed that four of the clusters demonstrated
   high stability and replicability, while the Relapse Risk and Early
   Action clusters were less stable. Differences among clusters on
   self-reported exercise behavior and a strong association with stage of
   change for regular exercise provided external validity evidence of the
   typology.
   Conclusions. The resulting typology reflects a range of motivational
   patterns that are likely to be responsive to different types of messages
   and strategies regarding adoption and maintenance of regular exercise.
   The typology also generates a number of hypotheses about the identified
   clusters that can be empirically tested in further studies. (C) 2003

   was developed. The structural equivalence of the two versions was
   demonstrated from a cross-cultural perspective with 309 and 173 healthy
   volunteers from Sweden and Germany, respectively, who completed both
   versions in one session. In testing for the replicability of the factors
   across both samples as well as across both versions, an orthogonal
   Procrustes rotation method was used. The reliability coefficients for
   the revision were higher than the former version for both samples. The
   factor structures of the inventory remain highly equivalent across
   cultures and across versions. The results indicate a cross-cultural
   transferability of the Temperament and Character dimensions of the
   inventory. The stability and the validity of the 7-factor model of

AB Identification of behavioral loci through complex trait mapping remains
   a widely employed approach but suffers from poor gene localization and
   low replicability. Genome-tagged mice (GTMs) are overlapping sets of
   congenic strains spanning the whole genome and offer the possibilities
   of superior mapping power and reproducibility. In this study, three GTM
   strains each consisting of an average similar to27 cM DBA/2J genomic
   intervals introgressed onto a C57BL/6J background were employed for
   localization of behavioral traits. These GTMs were chosen because the
   corresponding chromosomal regions had been previously identified as
   containing loci for learning and memory. Analysis of the GTMs allowed
   confirmation of the learning and memory loci, and one on chromosome 3
   was in addition fine mapped to an 8.8-cM region of overlap between two
   of the GTMs. Moreover, loci for prepulse inhibition of the startle
   response, acoustic startle response, and spontaneous locomotor activity
   were also mapped. These results suggest that the GTMs should be a
   valuable resource for mapping and confirmation of loci contributing to
   complex behavioral traits in the mouse. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB Rationale: Adverse cognitive effects associated with lithium are often
   implicated as contributing to vocational and social impairment, as well
   as medication noncompliance. As impaired cognitive functioning caused by
   lithium has clear clinical implications, it is important to determine
   whether evidence for or against impaired cognitive functioning exists in
   the literature. Objectives: An attempt is made to synthesize findings
   from previous studies, which assess a variety of cognitive domains, to
   determine whether conclusions can be drawn regarding lithium-associated
   cognitive impairment. The "reversibility" of neuropsychological
   impairment following lithium discontinuation and whether lithium
   administration has negative cumulative effects on cognition were also
   reviewed. Methods: Key word searches on "Medline" and "Psych Info" were
   completed for clinical articles that investigated the neuropsychological
   effects of lithium in clinical and normal populations between 1968 and
   2000. Results: Despite methodological flaws, poor replicability and the
   subtle cognitive effects of lithium, five consistent findings emerged
   from the review; impairment on tasks of psychomotor speed, impaired
   functioning in the majority of studies examining verbal memory, no
   impairment on tasks of visuo-spatial constructional ability or
   attention/ concentration, and no negative cumulative effect.
   Conclusions: Many patients administered lithium carbonate complained of
   mental slowness. Lithium carbonate also appeared to have definite, yet
   subtle, negative effects on psychomotor speed. Studies reviewed also
   showed a trend toward impaired verbal memory. Recommendations with
   respect to future research, methodological and statistical problems, and
   additional clinical implications are presented.

AB Systematic conservation planning requires rigorous methods.
   Methodological rigor and scientific defensibility are enhanced by
   conceptual frameworks, standards, and criteria for guiding and
   evaluating individual plans. The Wildlands Project is developing
   wildlands network designs in various regions across North America, based
   on the goals of rewilding-restoration of wilderness qualities and intact
   food webs and biodiversity conservation. The project employs such modern
   conservation planning tools as spatially explicit habitat and population
   models and site-selection algorithms. I created a checklist to assist
   staff, contractors, and cooperators with the Wildlands Project in the
   development of regional conservation assessments and wildlands network
   designs that are consistent with currently accepted standards for
   science-based conservation planning. The checklist also has proven
   useful in the peer review of plans. The checklist consists of eight
   general standards, each of which includes several specific criteria that
   relate to the qualifications of staff, choice of biodiversity surrogates
   and goals, methodological comprehensiveness and rigor, replicability,
   analytic rigor, peer review, and overall quality of scholarship.
   Application of the checklist is meant to be flexible and to encourage
   creativity and innovation. Nevertheless, every plan must be
   scientifically defensible and must make the best use of available data,
   staff, and resources. Moreover, some degree of consistency is required
   to link individual plans together into a continental-scale network. The
   checklist may provide a template that other conservation organizations,
   agencies, scientists, and activists can adapt to their programs.

AB Purpose: To evaluate within-scanner and between-scanner reliability of
   fractional anisotropy (FA) and trace (sum of the diagonal elements of
   the diffusion tensor) as measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).
   Materials and Methods: Ten young healthy adults were scanned on three
   separate days, on two different systems made by the same manufacturer.
   One scan was acquired at one site, and two scans were acquired on two
   different occasions on another scanner at another site. Three levels of
   analysis were used to compare the DTI metrics: 1) a voxel-by-voxel
   analysis of all supratentorial brain (gray matter + white matter +
   cerebrospinal fluid) and of supratentorial white matter; 2) a
   slice-by-slice analysis of supratentorial white matter; and 3) a
   single-region analysis of the corpus callosum.
   Results: The voxel-by-voxel analysis of all supratentorial brain found
   that FA and trace measures and correlations were equivalently and
   significantly higher within than across scanners. For supratentorial
   white matter, FA was similar within and across scanners, whereas trace
   demonstrated across-scanner bias. A similar pattern was observed for the
   slice-by-slice comparison. For the single-region analysis of the corpus
   callosum, within-scanner FA and trace measures were highly reproducible
   for FA (CV = 1.9%) and trace (CV = 2.6%), but both DTI measures showed a
   systematic mean bias across scanners (CV 4.5% for FA and CV = 7.5% for
   trace).
   Conclusion: These estimates of measurement variation and scanner bias
   can be used to predict effect sizes for longitudinal and multisite
   studies using diffusion tensor imaging.

AB Although type-nouns (e.g., idiot, hero) are important in person
   description. lexical studies of personality have concentrated on
   adjectives. This study tested structural hypotheses using 372 highly
   familiar English-language type-nouns and descriptions by 607
   participants of either themselves, a liked, or a disliked target person.
   One- and 2-factor structures were most robust, and replicated similar
   structures found in previous adjectival studies. Additionally, the
   structure with 8 orthogonal factors had good replicability and
   applicability within single-gender subsamples; as in previous studies of
   type-nouns, it included factors corresponding directly to Extraversion
   and Intellect/Openness, but also to Attractiveness and Masculinity (or
   Ruggedness). The Big Five was only weakly replicated. Personality
   taxonomies based on adjectives are unlikely to be comprehensive, because
   type-nouns have different content emphases.

   populations has produced equivocal results. The present data
   investigated the replicability in younger participants of the
   prototypical adult finding of Mathews and MacLeod (1985) with patients
   with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD).
   Method. A sample of 19 child and adolescent patients with GAD and 19
   controls completed the modified Stroop paradigm with threat,
   depression-related, positive and neutral words.
   Results. The data revealed a selective Stroop interference effect for
   negative emotional information in the GAD patients, relative to the
   performance of the controls.
   Conclusions. The results provide evidence of a modified Stroop effect
   for negative emotional material in children and adolescents with GAD,
   suggesting that modified Stroop processing in younger generally anxious
   populations broadly mirrors the profile of results in adults.

AB The utility of a configural type approach for predictions from
   personality is currently controversial. Configural types predict
   important personality correlates, but continuous dimensions based on the
   same data often fare much better in cross-sectional head-to-head
   comparisons. However many such comparisons can be considered unfair to
   the type approach, confound diverse differences between type and
   dimensional approaches, and rely only on cross-sectional data. A
   sequence of analyses is reported that include fairer comparisons and
   deconfound differences due to the number of predictors, categorical
   versus dimensional predictors, dichotomized dimensions versus configural
   types, dimensional versus type criterion variables, and cross-sectional
   versus longitudinal predictions. The results suggest incremental
   validity of configural types over dimensions only in a very few cases.

AB Objective: Some researchers have questioned the stability of the
   three-factor structure of the 20-Item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20)
   or the reliability of one or more factors of the scale. The aim of this
   study was to assess the replicability of the factor structure of the
   TAS-20. in a large community sample and to determine also whether the
   same three-factor structure can be recovered in men and women. The study
   also assessed the reliability of the scale and the influence of gender,
   age, and education on TAS-20 scores. Method: The TAS-20 was administered
   to 1933 adults (880 men and 1053 women) residing in several small cities
   and towns in Ontario, Canada. The factor structure of the scale was
   assessed using confirmatory factor analysis (CIA). Results: The
   three-factor structure of the TAS-20 was replicable in the entire
   community sample and also separately in men and women. The TAS-20 and
   its three factors demonstrated internal reliability, and the variables
   of gender, age, and education accounted for relatively small or modest
   amounts of variability in total TAS-20 and factor scale scores.
   Conclusion: The results provide strong support for the reliability and
   factorial validity of the TAS-20 and indicate the importance of using
   CFA when assessing the replicability and theoretical integrity of the
   factor structure of the scale. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB Objective: This paper reviews research relating to the factor analysis
   of the GHQ-12. We explore the question of whether there is a consistent
   replicable structure to the GHQ-12 using: (i) a comparative analysis of
   fit between identified factor models; and (ii) a confirmatory factor
   analysis of GHQ-12 data from our own study.
   Method: The factor models proposed from the literature were reviewed.
   The published factor loadings were used to carry out a factor matching
   analysis to identify similarities between the various factor models that
   have been identified. In addition, 490 patients visiting their general
   practitioner completed the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) in the
   first phase of a longitudinal study evaluating service delivery to rural
   Tasmania. Three different methods for scoring the GHQ-12 were utilized
   and each resultant data set was analysed using a Confirmatory Factor
   Analysis (CFA) to establish which of the various factor models provided
   the most consistent description of the data.
   Result: None of the complete factor models that have been proposed have
   been consistently replicated across studies. Isolated factors were
   replicated between some studies but no single factor structure was
   replicated across all studies. All of the models had adequate fit to the
   Tasmanian data when the usual scoring was used. However, only one model
   had a consistently high 'goodness of fit' across scoring methods.
   Conclusion: It was concluded that the 'best fit' was achieved by a model
   based on an early factor analytic study using an Australian sample. It
   was suggested that researchers wanting to extract scales from the GHQ-12
   could use this model.

   We now present a replication and extension of that experiment. In
   addition, we propose a new method for estimating the cross-validity of
   the results based on intersubject correlations, report further data on
   the localization of EROS, and present an analysis of its spatial
   resolution. The results replicate our original findings. The
   intersubject correlation is generally quite high (r =.6-.8). The spatial
   resolution analysis indicates that activities from cortical areas
   located approximately 1.5 cm. apart are measurable independently without
   cross talk. This study provides further support for the idea that
   noninvasive optical imaging can be used to derive images of brain
   activity combining good spatial and temporal resolution.

AB In the open-field behavior of rodents, Software for Exploring
   Exploration (SEE) can be used for an explicit design of behavioral
   endpoints with high genotype discrimination and replicability across
   laboratories. This ability is demonstrated here in the development of a
   measure for darting behavior. The behavior of two common mouse inbred
   strains, C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2), was analyzed across three
   different laboratories, and under the effect of cocaine or amphetamine.
   "Darting" was defined as having higher acceleration during progression
   segments while moving less during stops. D2 mice darted significantly
   more than B6 mice in each laboratory, despite being significantly less
   active. These differences were maintained following cocaine
   administration (up to 20 mg/kg) and only slightly altered by amphetamine
   (up to 5 mg/kg) despite a several fold increase in activity. The
   replicability of darting behavior was confirmed in additional
   experiments distinct from those used for its design. The strategy
   leading to the darting measure may be used to develop additional
   discriminative and replicable endpoints of open-field behavior. (C) 2003

   being injected. Results suggest that well-designed tests may

   that the typological approach offers a systematic, empirically rigorous

   with the idiographic case-centered approach. Recent advances in cluster
   analysis validation make it a promising method for uncovering natural
   typologies. This paper also reviewed findings from personality and
   family studies that have revealed 3 prototypical personalities and
   parenting styles: Adjusted/Authoritative, Overcontrolled/Authoritarian,
   and Undercontrolled/Permissive. These prototypes are theorized to be
   synonymous with attractor basins in psychological state space. The
   connection between family types and personality structure as well as
   future directions of typological research were also discussed.

   across groups (per instrument) and across the two instruments (per
   sample), using principal components analysis and congruence analysis.
   The component structure found by Ward was partly replicated in the Dutch
   group, thus cross-validating the use of the two instruments with these
   patients. Moreover, as found by Ward, the MMPI-2 content and
   supplementary scales of the Dutch sample proved to be important
   determinants of the first three MMPI-2 components, adding to convergent
   validity. Questions remained about the influence of the (dis)continuity
   of MCMI-II and MCMI-III on the replicability of the MCMI components.

AB A major challenge facing modern parapsychology continues to be the

   obtain positive evidence for psi, others, equally consistently, appear
   to be less successful. Previous research has attempted to explain this
   so-called 'experimenter effect' in terms of both psychological variables
   (in terms of how the experimenter treats his or her participants) and
   parapsychological variables (the experimenter may use his or her own psi
   to affect the data). In this paper, both of these interpretations are
   considered, as are other possible interpretations (such as experimenter
   error and experimenter fraud). Research in this area emphasises
   the-important role of the experimenter in parapsychology The paper
   concludes with a discussion of possible implications for the study of

AB OBJECTIVE: Antenatal steroids result in fetal lung maturation, but may
   retard brain development. Auditory brainstem-evoked response (ABR) is a
   noninvasive assessment of brainstem maturation. The objective of this
   study was to determine if antenatal steroids affect brainstem maturation
   in infants </=32 weeks gestational age (GA).
   DESIGN/METHODS: Bilateral monaural ABR were performed within the first
   24 hours using 80 db nHL unfiltered click stimuli at a repetition rate
   of 39.9/seconds. ABR waveforms were categorized into Response Types
   based on response replicability and peak identification. Absolute wave
   latencies and interpeak latencies were measured when applicable. Data
   were collected for antenatal steroid exposure, mode of delivery,
   chorioamnionitis in utero, exposure to illicit drugs, exposure to
   magnesium sulfate, mechanical ventilation and 5 minute Apgar score <5
   minute. Infants with TORCH infections, unstable conditions, and
   chromosomal disorders were excluded.
   RESULTS: Of 186 infants studied, 130 received antenatal steroids. Data
   were analyzed in 2 week GA intervals. There was a significant difference
   (P<0.05) in race (29 vs 39% African-American), birth weight (1231 vs
   1416 gm) and use of magnesium sulfate (60 vs 32%) among infants who did
   and did not receive antenatal steroids, respectively. There was no
   significant difference in the other parameters measured. Even after
   controlling for confounding variables, there was no difference between
   absolute wave latencies or interpeak latencies between groups at either
   28 to 29 weeks' or 30 to 31 weeks' postmenstrual age. There was no
   significant difference in frequency distribution of ABR waveform
   Response Types between groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: Antenatal steroids have neither a deleterious nor
   beneficial effect on brainstem maturation as measured by ABR in infants
   at </=32 weeks GA.

AB PURPOSE: This study was conducted to determine statistically the most
   repeatable mandibular position of 3 centric relation methods.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three centric relation recording methods commonly
   reported in the literature were selected: bimanual mandibular
   manipulation with a jig, chin point guidance with a jig, and Gothic arch
   tracing. Fourteen healthy adult volunteers (7 males and 7 females), with
   an average age of 26.61 +/- 4.20 years and no history of extractions,
   temporomandibular joint dysfunction, or orthodontic treatment, were
   selected for the study. Accurate casts were mounted on an articulator
   (Denar D4A) by means of a facebow and maximum intercuspation silicone
   registration record. A mechanical 3-dimensional mandibular position
   indicator was constructed and mounted on the articulator enabling the
   operator to analyze the mandibular positions in 3 spatial axes (x,
   anteroposterior; y, superoinferior; z, mediolateral shift). Each centric
   relation method was recorded four times on each subject (at baseline, 1
   hour, 1 day, and 1 week at approximately the same time of day). Records
   were transferred to the articulator, and data were extracted using a
   stereomicroscope modified to accept the mandibular position indicator.
   RESULTS: Variability within subjects ranged from 0.03 mm (left-side z
   axis for the bimanual method) to 1.6 mm (left-side y axis for the Gothic
   arch method). To indicate the least variable (most repeatable) method a
   comparison was made using the F test. The bimanual method was the most
   consistent, showing between 10.11 (p = 1) and 0.438 (p = 0.005) times
   less variation than the Gothic arch method (the least consistent). The
   repeatability of the chin point guidance method was somewhere between
   the other 2 methods.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed that of the 3 centric
   relation methods evaluated, the bimanual manipulation method positioned
   the condyles in the temporomandibular joint with a more consistent
   repeatability than the other 2 methods, whereas the Gothic arch was the
   least consistent method.

AB Mismatch negativity (MMN) is thought to represent a neurophysiological
   index of auditory information processing that is independent of
   attention. Because this measure does not require an overt behavioral
   response, MMN has potential to evaluate higher order perceptual
   abilities in infants, young children and difficult-to-test populations,
   thereby extending results obtained from more basic physiologic and
   electroacoustic measures (auditory brainstem responses, ABRs;
   otoacoustic emissions, OAEs). Whereas the basic tenet of MMN is
   appealing, several issues-of-contention remain to be solved before this
   event related potential (ERP) can be applicable for routine clinical
   use. These issues include the consistent identification of MMN within
   individuals (vs. groups), its stability over time, and its reportedly
   poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Herein, we focus on the issue of SNR,
   by comparing and contrasting SNR of MMN with other long latency auditory
   ERPs. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB SEE (Software for the Exploration of Exploration) is a visualization and
   analysis tool designed for the study of open-field behavior in rodents.
   In this paper, I present new extensions of SEE that were designed to
   facilitate its use for mouse behavioral phenotyping and, especially, for
   the problems of discrimination of genotypes and the replication of
   results across laboratories and experimental conditions. These
   extensions were specifically designed to promote a new approach in
   behavioral phenotyping, reminiscent of the approach that has been
   successfully employed in bioinformatics during recent years. The path
   coordinates of all animals from many experiments are stored in a
   database. SEE can be used to query, visualize, and analyze any desirable
   subsection of this database and to design new measures (endpoints) with
   increasingly better discriminative power and replicability. The use of
   the new extensions is demonstrated here in the analysis of results from
   several experiments and laboratories, with an emphasis on this approach.

AB To make the electroencephalogram (EEG) recording procedure more
   tolerable, listeners have been allowed in some experiments to watch an
   audible video while their auditory P1, N1, P2, and mismatch negativity
   (MMN) event-related potentials (ERPs) to experimental sounds have been
   measured. However, video sounds may degrade auditory ERPs to
   experimental sounds. This concern was tested with 19 adults who were
   instructed to ignore standard and deviant tones presented through
   headphones while they watched a video with the soundtrack audible in one
   condition and silent in the other. Video sound impaired the size,
   latency, and split-half reliability of the MMN, and it decreased the
   size of the P2. However, it had little effect on the P1 or N1 or on the
   split-half reliability of the P1-N1-P2 waveform, which was significantly
   more reliable than the MMN waveform. regardless of whether the video
   sound was on or off. The impressive reliability of the P1 and N1
   components allows for the use of video sound during EEG recording, and
   they may prove useful for assessing auditory processing in listeners who
   cannot tolerate long testing sessions.

AB Background: Suicide-epidemiological research on short-term effects of
   elections on national/regional suicide and parasuicide incidence has
   yielded contradictory evidence. Reversing the cause-effect relationship
   of this line of research we investigated whether preceding regional
   suicide rates are related to subsequent election results. Methods: For
   Austria's 121 districts, we regressed averaged standardized suicide
   rates for the preceding period (1988-1994) on political parties'
   subsequent electoral gains/losses (1999-to-1995) while controlling for a
   set of 12 domain-relevant psychosocial/economic indices. Results:
   Stepwise weighted multiple regression led to a significant model. The
   1999-to-1995 electoral gains/losses of two opposition parties, together
   with the population variation caused by migration balance and by
   births/deaths balance, accounted for a substantial part (30%) of the
   variability in preceding district-level suicide rates. Various other
   social indices failed to contribute further substantial increments to
   this model. Conclusions: This finding suggests that variations in
   preceding regional suicide incidence might be mirrored in subsequent
   changes in voting behavior. A speculative post hoc explanation for the
   finding is offered: on a community level, suicide's aftermath might
   produce socially and politically alienated survivors of suicide who
   co-shape swings towards opposition parties in subsequent general
   elections. The finding calls for more research on suicide's long-term
   aftermath. Limitations: Within-country replicability and cross-national
   generalizability await further investigation. At present, the
   factor/mechanism accounting for this finding is neither well-established
   nor has been directly tested. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

   three factor matrices. The factor matrices obtained in the present study
   are equivalent to those reported in the reference studies, although the

   psychological variables affect survival after bone marrow
   transplantation, the reviewers' analysis of the methodologically sound
   studies suggested that survival after bone marrow transplantation is not
   substantively affected by depressed mood or other psychopathology in
   adults or by social support in adults or children. Longer survival may
   be related to lower "anxious preoccupation," higher "fighting spirit,"
   and better quality of life ratings before and soon after transplant in
   adults. Overall, however the literature is insufficiently developed to
   provide definitive evidence for a relationship between psychological
   variables and survival after bone marrow transplantation. Future primary
   studies in this area should be designed to maximize replicability and

AB Bone age is widely used as an osseous maturation method to assess
   biological development in clinical and auxological studies. Numerical
   methods for calculating bone age have better replicability; however,
   they require a wide data manipulation. The aim of this study was to
   evaluate the accuracy of bone age estimation by using just a few
   ossification centers. In 205 hand and wrist radiographs of children and
   adolescents, aged 0.9-17.4 years old (111 males and 94 females), bone
   age was determined by two trained observers employing the five-bone (B5)
   and the TW2 methods. To compare the results of the two methods, the mean
   differences by age and sex were tested by the Mann-Whitney test. The
   relationship of the bone age distribution estimated by B5 and TW2 was
   calculated and the mean of the bone age determined by the two methods
   was plotted by age and by differences between bone age calculated by the
   two methods +/- 2 SD. The bone age determined by B5 was between 1.2 and
   16.8, and by TW2 was between 1.2 and 18.0 years. The mean differences
   between B5 and TW2 (-0.06 +/- 0.6) were not significant (p >0.05). The
   distribution of mean differences by age and method demonstrated that all
   deviations were encompassed into +/- 2 SD with no particular bias. In
   general terms, a good agreement was obtained between these two methods.

AB Objectives. The purpose of this study was to investigate the theory of
   planned behaviour's (TPB) mediating hypothesis between the five-factor
   model of personality and exercise behaviour using an extended TPB model
   including concepts of affective and instrumental attitude, injunctive
   and descriptive norm, controllability, and self-efficacy. It was
   hypothesized that extraversion's activity facet would have a significant
   direct effect on exercise behaviour while controlling for the TPB, based
   on the presupposition that activity may represent a disposition that
   predicts exercise beyond planned behaviour.
   Design. To test the replicability of these findings, we examined this
   research question with undergraduate students prospectively and cancer
   survivors, using a cross-sectional design.
   Results. Using structural equation modelling, the results indicated that
   activity had a significant effect (p <.05) on exercise behaviour (study
   1 =.20; study 2 =.31) while controlling for the TPB.
   Conclusions. This study suggests the importance of extraversion's
   activity facet on exercise behaviour,even when controlling for a TPB
   model with additional social-cognitive concepts and disparate population
   samples.

   can be accomplished through the use of some commonly available

   becomes an automated program option in standard statistical software
   programs (e.g., SPSS, SAS), quantitative researchers may have to make do

AB Since the early 1990s, Argentinean grain production underwent a dramatic
   increase in grains production (from 26 million tons in 1988/89 to over
   75 million tons in 2002/2003). Several factors contributed to this
   "revolution," but probably one of the most important was the
   introduction of new genetic modification (GM) technologies, specifically
   herbicide-tolerant soybeans. This article analyses this process,
   reporting on the economic benefits accruing to producers and other
   participating actors as well as some of the environmental and social
   impacts that could be associated with the introduction of the new
   technologies. In doing so, it lends attention to the synergies between
   GM soybeans and reduced-tillage technologies and also explores some of
   the institutional factors that shed light on the success of this case,
   including aspects such as the early availability of a reliable biosafety
   mechanism and a special intellectual property rights (IPR) situation. In
   its concluding comments, this article also posts a number of questions
   about the replicability of the experience and some pending policy issues
   regarding the future exploitation of GM technologies in Argentina.

AB An important task in machine learning is determining which learning
   algorithm works best for a given data set. When the amount of data is
   small the same data needs to be used repeatedly in order to get a
   reasonable estimate of the accuracy of the learning algorithms. This
   results in violations of assumptions on which standard tests are based
   and makes it hard to design a good test.
   In this article, we investigate sign tests to address the problem of
   choosing the best of two learning algorithms when only a small data set
   is available. Sign tests axe conceptually simple and no assumption about
   underlying distributions is required. We show that simplistic sample
   generation can lead to flawed test outcomes. Furthermore, we identify a
   test that performs well based on Type I error (showing a difference
   between algorithms when there is none), power (showing a difference when
   it indeed exists) and replicability.
   Replicability is a novel measure of a quality of a test that gives an
   indication how likely it is that the test outcome will be the same when
   the same test on the same data with the same sampling scheme and same
   pair of algorithms is executed, but with a different randomization of
   the data. A new definition of replicability is provided and its benefits
   highlighted. Empirical evidence is provided to show the test is robust
   under a varied range of circumstances.

   measure. In an Italian sample (N = 600), the PANAS showed solid
   psychometric properties, and several American findings with the PANAS
   were replicated. The replicability of the PANAS factor structure was
   confirmed by high congruence coefficients between the American and
   Italian varimax solutions. Alternative models were tested with
   Confirmatory Factor Analysis; as in previous studies, the two-factor
   model achieved the best fit, but absolute fit indices varied with the
   estimation methods used. The independence/bipolarity issue was also
   explored. Positive and negative affect scales remain substantially
   independent after accounting for measurement error and acquiescence.
   Some predictions from the tripartite model of anxiety and depression
   were confirmed, and external correlates of the PANAS replicated those
   found in other language and cultures. These analyses offer strong
   support for the construct validity of the Italian PANAS.

AB A methodology is provided for state departments of transportation (DOTs)
   to conduct vulnerability assessments of their highway assets. This tool
   allows state DOTs to assess the vulnerability of their physical assets,
   such as bridges and tunnels; to develop possible countermeasures to
   deter, detect, and delay the consequences of terrorist threats; to
   estimate the capital and operating costs of such countermeasures; and to
   improve security operational planning. The audience for this methodology
   is broad-from senior officials involved in the initial planning stage of
   the process, to midlevel managers charged with developing the assessment
   plans and procedures, to field personnel. The state DOTs must organize
   and manage a multidisciplinary team whose members have a working
   knowledge of the department's mission, its critical assets, and its
   policies, plans, and procedures. The methodology involves six steps for
   conducting a vulnerability assessment of highway transportation assets.
   They provide a straightforward method for examining critical assets and
   identifying cost-effective countermeasures to guard against terrorism.
   The criteria used in selecting the preferred approaches include
   availability, accessibility, transparency, replicability,
   reasonableness, scallability, robustness, cost-effectiveness, and
   modularity.

AB Scholars have variously described the development experience of the

   posited different meanings and significance to its developmental
   trajectory. Rather than following the usual one-dimensional accounting
   of Kerala's achievements and shortcomings, we present a historically
   informed social and political analysis to reveal the meaning and
   significance of the "Kerala model" of development. This article, thus,
   critically appraises Kerala's development experience since
   decolonization to show how the discourse on development and the
   discursive practices of the dominant actors involved in governance of
   Kerala diverge in recent years, especially after the second round of
   economic liberalizations at the national level in 1991, which
   coincidently corresponds to the beginning of the newest phase of
   economic globalization. Old lessons are reviewed based on the notion of
   replicability of the "Kerala model" and new lessons are analyzed within
   the contexts of sustainability and economic globalization.

   (Dinophyceae), Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Thalassiosira pseudonana
   (Bacillariophyceae). Emphasising the potential use of NMR spectroscopy
   as a routine analysis of microalgae we chose a straightforward procedure
   for culturing and harvesting, without extraction or radioactive
   labelling. We obtained well-resolved HR MAS H-1 NMR spectra from the 4
   algae, despite the fact that our samples contained whole cells and some
   residual sea water. Selected parts of 5 replicate spectra from each
   microalga were used as input in 2 multivariate pattern-recognition
   strategies (principal component analysis and fuzzy clustering), both
   analyses showing clear grouping of the different species. Two spectra
   from a previous sample run (cultures grown under the same conditions)
   were also included, and both were correctly classified. We therefore
   consider HR MAS 1H NMR spectroscopy to be a potential method of
   classification for microalgae, with statistical data processing
   indicating replicability and robustness of the method.

   personality types, labeled resilient, overcontrolled, and
   undercontrolled, are identified. In two longitudinal samples, the
   undercontrolled type was related to intellectual decline over a period
   of six years. Both stability and change in childhood personality type
   were observed in longitudinal analyses. The number of risks
   characterizing a child's family predicted change in personality type
   over a two-year interval. Finally, personality type was found to be a
   moderator of the association of Head Start participation with cognitive
   development and behavior problems in childhood. The implications of
   personality type for understanding childhood development, particularly

AB Background: The Diabetic Foot Ulcer Scale (DFS) provides comprehensive
   measurement of the impact of diabetic foot ulcers on patients' QOL
   through self-administration of 64 items comprising 15 subscales.
   Objective: To develop and evaluate a short form of the DFS (DFS-SF) to
   reduce patient burden and the number of outcome measures, and to improve
   sensitivity to change in clinical condition.
   Methods: The DFS-SF was created through the analysis of data from a
   double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial of the efficacy and
   safety of becaplermin (recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor
   BB) in the treatment of chronic, full-thickness, neuropathic, diabetic
   foot ulcers. Using these data, items demonstrating poor psychometric
   properties were eliminated. Exploratory factor analyses were then
   conducted to develop a new, more parsimonious scaling algorithm that
   optimised the internal consistency of the new subscales. Finally, data
   from two additional clinical trials were used to assess replicability of
   the DFS-SF subscale structure.
   Results: The DFS-SF contains a total of 29 items comprising six
   subscales. The results of both confirmatory and exploratory factor
   analyses provided support for the scaling algorithm. The DFS-SF
   subscales showed good internal consistency, reliability and construct
   validity, and demonstrated sensitivity to ulcer healing.
   Conclusions: The results of this investigation indicate that the DFS-SF
   has good psychometric properties and replicability.

AB Viruses are now recognized as the most abundant members of marine
   microbial communities and are likely important agents in controlling the
   productivity and diversity of co-existing bacterioplankton. Current
   methods for estimating viral production (VP) rely on one or more poorly
   constrained conversion factors. Here, three incubation-based VP methods;
   fluorescently labeled viruses (FLV), dilution (DIL) and thymidine
   incorporation (TdR), were evaluated in water samples from the Delaware
   (DB) and Chesapeake (CB) Bays. In the FLV method the changing ratio of
   an added fluorescently labeled viral tracer to total viruses is used to
   estimate production of new viruses. The dilution approach utilizes
   virus-free water to dilute viral abundance to ca. 10% of original
   concentration in experimental incubations. Viral production is inferred
   from the slope of the regression line for changes in viral abundance
   over time. The TdR method measures VP through incorporation of
   3H-thymidine into the viral fraction. VP rates were variable according
   to each method. For station 858 CB, average VP rates were higher for FLV
   and TdR (16.9X1010 vir/L/d), (17.2X1010 vir/L/d) respectively, than for
   DIL (4.50X109 vir/L/d). Mean estimates of virioplankton turnover varied
   between methods and locations: CB (FLV 1.85d, DIL 0.68d, TdR 1.64d); DB
   (FLV 1.65d, DIL 0.19d). Using a burst size of 50 to estimate
   viral-mediated bacterial mortality indicates that FLV overestimates VP
   in eutrophic water samples as greater than 100% of bacterial production
   would be consumed through viral lysis. DIL and TdR VP estimates yielded
   more realistic estimates of viral-mediated mortiality with respect to
   bacterial production. The FLV method had the advantage of providing both
   VP and virus removal data. However, FLV requires preparation of a
   labeled viral concentrate and more microscopic enumerations than DIL.
   Among the methods DIL was the least difficult and most efficient method
   however, 80% of bacteria were removed during vacuum filtration resulting
   in poor replicability. The TdR approach gave similar VP estimates to
   DIL, but requires use of a large and poorly constrained conversion
   factor.

   This paper describes a gasifier-based silk-reeling oven. It is a
   downdraft, throatless gasifier that produces less tar and particulate
   matter are produced in its raw producer gas and it allows the use of
   relatively large wood chips and other fuels compared with updraft and
   cross-draft gasifiers. The patenting and commercialization,
   replicability, long-term impact and future plans for biomass

AB Objective: The validity of the SCOFF delivered orally as a screening
   tool for eating disorders has previously been established, but clinical
   screening for eating disorders also occurs via written format, for
   example, in occupational health settings. The objective was to compare
   responses to the SCOFF between verbal and written administration.
   Method: In a volunteer group of nursing and midwifery students at a
   South London University SCOFF was delivered orally at interview and via
   written questionnaire. Order was allocated randomly with repeat
   administration interrupted by distraction questions. Results: There were
   185 students who participated, providing 178 fully completed responses.
   Twenty subjects were male. There was overall agreement in the scores of
   157 subjects (88.2%), providing a kappa coefficient of 0.811, with
   agreement in prediction of eating disorder for 167 (93.8%) and a kappa
   value of 0.824 (both p < 0.001). For 82 subjects administered the SCOFF
   verbally first followed by the written version, the kappa statistic was
   0.752 (p < 0.001). For 96 subjects with SCOFF administered in reverse

   Results demonstrated overall good replicability of the SCOFF
   administered as a written questionnaire compared to oral interview. Two
   trends were noted. The first was towards higher scores with written
   versus oral delivery irrespective of order, possibly indicating enhanced
   disclosure via written format. The second was of less consistency where
   verbal preceded written responses. Altogether findings support use of
   the SCOFF where a concise, valid and reliable screening for eating
   disorders is required in written form. (C) 2002 by Wiley Periodicals,

AB We had shown that striatal DA D2 receptors levels predicted the

   nondrug-abusing subjects. Here, we assessed the replicability of this

   to determine stability) in seven nondrug-abusing subjects to assess if
   they predicted the self-reports of "drug-liking" to intravenous
   methylphenidate (0.5 mg/kg). DA D2 measures were significantly
   correlated with "drug-liking" in both evaluations (r = 0.82 and r =
   0.78); subjects with the lowest levels reported the higher ratings of
   "drug-liking" and vice versa. These results replicate our previous
   findings and provide further evidence that striatal DA D2 receptors
   modulate reinforcing responses to stimulants in humans and may underlie
   predisposition for drug self-administration. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB Introduction: An important methodological challenge encountered in
   acupuncture clinical research involves the design of treatment protocols
   that help ensure standardization and replicability while allowing for
   the necessary flexibility to tailor treatments to each individual.
   Manualization of protocols used in clinical trials of acupuncture and
   other traditionally-based complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)
   systems facilitates the systematic delivery of replicable and
   standardized, yet individually-tailored treatments.
   Objectives: To facilitate high-quality CAM acupuncture research by
   outlining a method for the systematic design and implementation of
   protocols used in CAM clinical trials based on the concept of treatment
   manualization.
   Methods: A series of treatment manuals was developed to systematically
   articulate the Chinese medical theoretical and clinical framework for a
   given Western-defined illness, to increase the quality and consistency
   of treatment, and to standardize the technical aspects of the protocol.
   In all, three manuals were developed for National Institutes of Health
   (NIH)-funded clinical trials of acupuncture for depression, spasticity
   in cerebral palsy, and repetitive stress injury. In Part 1, the
   rationale underlying these manuals and the challenges encountered in
   creating them are discussed, and qualitative assessments of their
   utility are provided. In Part II, a methodology to develop treatment
   manuals for use in clinical trials is detailed, and examples are given.
   Conclusions: A treatment manual provides a precise way to train and
   supervise practitioners, enable evaluation of conformity and competence,
   facilitate the training process, and increase the ability to identify
   the active therapeutic ingredients in clinical trials of acupuncture.

AB We developed a quantitative and replicable classification system to
   improve understanding of historical composition and structure within
   northern Wisconsin's forests. The classification system was based on
   statistical cluster analysis and two forest metrics, relative dominance
   (% basal area) and relative importance (mean of relative dominance and
   relative density), as computed from the original U.S. Public Land Survey
   (PLS) bearing-tree data. Broad forest patterns are consistent between
   the two metrics; yet, detailed inspection highlights different aspects
   of historical structure. Maps produced characterize vegetation at
   regional scales and reveal patterns that can be interpreted in the
   context of environmental constraints. Our classifications have a fairly
   coarse spatial grain (2.6 km(2)) and fine-scale, patchily distributed
   ecosystems types are not represented. This resolution, however, is
   consistent with that of the PLS bearing-tree data, and maintaining it
   allowed retention of other beneficial map qualities, including
   quantitative representation of the data, replicability, flexibility, and
   an assessment of robustness and confidence. Our classifications are
   broadly applicable for regional-scale scientific and forest-management
   uses, including (i) assessing natural variability, (ii) determining the
   potential distribution of species, (iii) setting goals for ecological
   restoration, and (iv) calculating landscape change.

AB Informal settlements house a significant percentage of the population of
   developing cities, yet there is no common planning framework for
   upgrading these settlements. Conventional method-based approaches
   applicable to new areas or sites and services schemes are inappropriate
   and so the dominant approaches currently available tend to focus on
   principles and best practices. Yet neither of these has yet provided a
   convenient basis for replicability on a significant scale. This paper
   argues for a return to a method-based approach For upgrading and sets
   out a planning framework that could Form the basis for such an approach.
   It is based upon the ability of external interventions to address the
   key issue of vulnerability and argues for the need to plan for the
   long-term sustainability of informal settlements. It uses the experience
   of a pilot project in Cape Town to demonstrate the practicality of the
   planning framework. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The concept of perceptual defensiveness is related to subliminal
   perception and preconscious processing. Meta-analyses of earlier
   experiments, 6 in the United States and Holland and 10 in Iceland, on
   the Defense Mechanism Test (DMT)-ESP relationship had shown
   significantly higher ESP scoring by less defensive participants. In the
   present experiment, conducted in Freiburg, Germany, 50 participants
   completed both DMT and ESP tasks. Questionnaires were administered on
   personality measures, religiosity, and other attitudes. Evaluation of
   the DMT in this experiment differs from that in previous experiments
   Instead of the human DMT ratings, the authors reconstructed the DMT
   ratings by regression analysis on the codings of the Icelandic
   experiments. However, the DMT-ESP relationship in the German experiment
   did not prove to be significant. Other significant correlations in the
   Icelandic data were the positive correlation between ESP performance and
   religiosity and the negative correlation between ESP performance and
   psychotism. In the present experiment, both correlations are confirmed.
   On the computerized ESP task, the participants scored significantly
   above chance, whereas the precognition task revealed psi-missing. The
   outcomes of detailed analyses of the DMT-ESP relationship in the 10
   Icelandic experiments, carried out in connection with this study, point
   to a personal factor connected with Martin Johnson, who hitherto
   evaluated the DMT in the DMT-ESP experiments. This throws serious doubt
   on the prospects for replicability of the DMT-ESP correlation in future
   experiments.

   functioning and IQ. Ten years later, as adolescents, overcontrolled
   resilients were shy and restrained yet conscientious and intelligent;
   resilient undercontrollers were extraverted, assertive, and impulsive;
   and brittles were relatively unintelligent. The discussion focused on
   the several meanings of person-centered methods, the sample-dependence

AB Aims The current study examined the usefulness of four prevailing
   alcohol typologies, assessed in terms of replicability of the
   multi-dimensional schemas, percentage of the sample classified by each
   typology, distribution of subtypes by gender and treatment site and
   construct validity of Type 1/Type 2. In addition, overlap of
   classification systems was examined to determine whether the four
   typologies may be narrowed to a smaller set of meaningful, non-redundant
   subtype schemas.
   Design Baseline data from five treatment outcome studies were used to
   facilitate subtyping according to four alcohol typologies: antisocial
   (ASP) versus non-ASP, early versus late onset, Type 1/Type 2 and Type
   A/Type B.
   Setting The studies were conducted at several in-patient and out-patient
   treatment sites.
   Participants The sample included 342 participants (23% female) who met
   DSM-III-R criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence. Measurements
   Subjects were assessed on substance use severity, family history,
   psychopathology, personality and psychosocial functioning.
   Findings Type 1/Type 2 and Type A/B typologies were replicated. Type
   1/Type 2 had poor construct validity due to symptom cluster overlap
   between the two subgroups. Only 14% of the subjects met criteria for ASP
   The two strongest associations including that between early versus late
   onset and Type 1/Type 2 and that between ASP versus non-ASP and Type
   A/Type 13, were expected and reflect overlaps in conceptual definitions.
   In comparison, the relationship between early versus late onset and ASP
   versus non-ASP and Type A/B was weak.
   Conclusions Clinical utility of the ASP/non-ASP typology is limited in
   non-Veterans Administration (VA) samples, due to low prevalence. The
   Type 1/Type 2 subtyping schema was redundant with the age of onset
   schema, and was the least internally valid of all four typologies. In
   general, the Type A/B schema was most promising of prevailing typologics
   studied. It was relatively inclusive, and the A, B groups were distinct
   from one another. However, dichotomous typologies may not be complex
   enough to be clinically useful descriptors of alcoholic samples. Aside
   from ASP and Type B, there appears to be heterogeneity within groups
   typically considered homogeneous, such as 'early versus late onset'
   alcoholics.

   Orientation Test (LOT), the Hope Scale (HS), and the Hunter Opinions,
   and Personal Expectations Scale. The definitions on which the measures
   are based are compared along with their reported reliability and
   construct validity. Three hundred and forty-seven undergraduate students
   completed the scales along with measures of trait negative affect (TNA)
   and trait positive affect (TPA), task- and emotion-oriented coping and
   perceived stress. All scale had adequate internal consistency and there
   was strong evidence of convergent validity. Regarding factor structure
   replicability the LOT was marginally superior. The Possibility of the
   scales' redundancy because of contamination by TNA or TPA depended on
   the criterion construct. It is argued that the LOT and HS are the scales
   of choice when assessing hope and/or optimism.

AB Community-based conservation and development has become the prevailing
   programmatic paradigm of conservation organizations and development
   donors over the last 20 years, spawning a myriad of integrated
   conservation and development projects (ICDP) around the world. Appealing
   for its ambitious aspiration to harmonize sustainable economic
   development at the local level with the conservation of legally
   established protected areas (e.g., parks and reserves), the ICDP
   approach recently has drawn criticism from conservation biologists for
   failing to ensure adequate protection of biodiversity. Development
   planners and economists have also raised questions about the financial
   sustainability of ICDPs in practice and the replicability of the model
   from highly local contexts to larger regional scales, This paper briefly
   reviews the central elements of the concept of integrated conservation
   and development and the emerging debate over its effectiveness, A
   description of the Community Initiative Program (CIP), a pilot program
   of the Rondonia Natural Resources Management project (PLANAFLORO) in the
   western Brazilian Amazon state of Rondonia, follows. The CIP is a
   significant experiment because it boldly attempted to apply the
   principles of ICDP to the regional scale involving numerous different
   communities in one program simultaneously. Based on the author's
   mid-term review of the CIP in 1999, the development and conservation
   impacts of the program are considered. While the CIP has not
   significantly curbed the degradation of protected areas in Rondonia as
   intended, the evidence suggests lower rates of deforestation in
   municipios (i.e. counties) with the highest concentrations of CIP
   projects, Although the economic development impacts are mixed,
   approximately 50% of the projects delivered tangible benefits to local
   communities. Lessons learned from the CIP are presented in the final
   section. Among the lessons learned from the CIP, detailed in the final
   section, are several that will be familiar to other ICDP evaluators: the
   importance of thematic coherence in initial project design, the need for
   explicit attention on environmental conservation objectives, deficient
   institutional capacity of implementing organizations, inadequate
   attention to women's concerns and roles in community projects, and lack
   of technical criteria for measuring project sustainability.

   Inventory of Consequences; W. Miller, J. Tonigan, & R. Longabough,

   reliability (lifetime) of InDUC scales (Study 1, N = 34) and the
   replicability of findings to the 5 InDUC scales (recent; Study 2, N =
   208). Four scales had good to excellent test-retest reliability.
   Findings also indicate that reductions in drug use and problems after
   treatment are large and that the magnitude of change differs between
   drug use and consequences. Consequences of drug use should be measured
   directly rather than be inferred from measures of use.

   based on measures of the Five-Factor Model. We consider several
   methodological artifacts that might be responsible for these types, and
   conclude that these artifacts may contribute to the replicability of
   types, but cannot entirely account for it. The present research attempts
   to replicate these types in four large and diverse adult samples: the
   Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (N = 1856); the East Baltimore
   Epidemiologic Catchment Area study (N = 486); the University of North
   Carolina Alumni Heart Study (N = 2 420); and an HIV risk reduction
   intervention study (N = 274). A clear replication (kappa = 0.60) of the
   proposed types vas found in only one sample by one standard of
   comparison. The failure of the three personality types to replicate in
   three of the four samples leads to the conclusion that they are not
   robust empirical entities. Type membership predicted psychosocial
   functioning and ego resiliency and control, but only because it
   summarized trait standing; dimensional trait measures were consistently
   better predictors. Nevertheless, while the types do not refer to
   distinct, homogeneous classes of persons, they do have utility as
   convenient labels summarizing combinations of traits that relate to
   important outcomes. Published in 2002 by John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Caspi (1998), Asendorpf and Van Aken (1999), and Asendorpf et al. (2001)
   described three personality types derived from Q-factor analysis of
   Q-sorts or cluster analysis of multiple trait ratings. The types were
   labelled as resilients, undercontrollers, and overcontrollers and they
   were described in terms of averaged Five-Factor Model (FFM) scores. The
   present study aimed to investigate the consistency and replicability of
   these prototypes across different FFM measures (i.e. HiPIC and NEO PI-R)
   and ages (children and adolescents). In addition, the stability of
   prototype classification across a 3 year interval was examined. The
   types described by Caspi and Asendorpf and colleagues were only
   partially replicable and consistent across ages starting from HiPIC
   ratings, but not for NEO-PI-R ratings. Prototype classification was not
   stable across a 3 year interval. It is concluded that cluster
   replicabilitly, consistency, and stability depend on sample
   characteristics and the multiple trait measures, although these
   difficulties do not necessarily limit the usefulness of the types for
   applied purposes. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

   replicated across different Big Five instruments (NEO-FFI and NEO-PI-R),
   and whether they, can be differentiated into replicable subtypes. For
   prototypes and subtypes, replicability within and consistency across
   samples was quantitatively measured. Three replicable prototypes were
   confirmed, but only two replicable resilient subtypes (well adjusted and

AB Conventional holographic memory systems have generally focused on a
   page-oriented storage approach. One common characteristic of these
   systems is that they require the recording of thousands of separate
   holograms, whether as local pages or individually placed bits, in order
   to fill the memory to capacity. While such configurations are suitable
   for write-once read-many (WORM) or rewritable memories, they are not
   practical as a distributable read-only memory (ROM) format, which
   requires fast replicability for mass production. A typical page-oriented
   system using a megabit-sized array would require the recording of
   hundreds of thousands of holograms to reach capacities of 100 GB or
   more. Even with millisecond-order hologram exposure times, taking into
   account the added time required for changing positions, recording one
   memory to full capacity would likely require tens of minutes, if not
   hours. In this paper we propose a novel holographic ROM architecture in
   which the time required to produce a 100 GB-order capacity disc may be
   reduced to under a minute, and potentially to the order of seconds.

   FINCA-Malawi, this paper empirically questions the replicability of
   Grameen-type banks in Africa. While the credit scheme was financially
   sustainable and FINCA clients had higher savings, working capital and
   business expenditure, these did not translate into higher household
   consumption. Clients' risk aversion in investment and
   uncharacteristically high turnover rates seem to explain the low program
   impact on the household economy.

AB The objective of this state-of-the-art review was to quantify the
   replicability of pesticide studies using micro/ mesocosms. Low
   interpretability of micro/mesocosm studies, and inconclusive and highly
   variable data, resulted in a discontinuation of the use of these studies
   for the registration of pesticides. Coefficients of variation, CV%, were
   calculated on the basis of data tables as a measure of statistical
   'effectiveness' taken from the literature. The average CV in the
   investigated studies was 45%; larger out-door mesocosms averaged 51%,
   and smaller indoor micro/mesocosms averaged 32%. CVs on variables
   involving animals were higher than CVs on plant end-points, which in
   turn were higher than abiotic variables for all experiments. However, to
   enhance the interpretability and implementation of micro/mesocosm
   studies for pesticide registration, a number of context-dependent steps
   could be incorporated; 1) determine the appropriate experimental design
   and number of replicates by using power analysis, 2) Utilise advanced
   statistical analysis, such as probabilistic effect distribution and
   principal response curves, 4) report, preferably in quantitative terms
   using power analysis, the risk of Type II error. The author's primary
   conclusion is that the level of CVs is context dependent and, therefore,
   it is not possible to suggest a generally acceptable level of CVs for
   all experiments. This has been suggested both directly and indirectly in
   the literature. Moreover, the number of insignificant (p > 0.05) results
   is high, 88% of all test biotic variables had no statistical
   significance. The average number of replicates were 3-4, which
   theoretically should yield significant effects at least at the highest
   test-concentration, then resulting in 75-66% insignificant results.

AB We address the concerns raised by Saucier about our proposed six-factor
   structure of personality. First, we dispute Saucier's new interpretation
   of the Negative Valence factor as a meaningful dimension of personality
   variation. We explain that Negative Valence terms may distort the
   structure of personality-descriptive terms, and that the substantive
   variance of Honesty is weakly correlated with Negative Valence. Also, we
   point out that our proposed six factors are (like the Big Five) roughly
   orthogonal, and that the occurrence of rotational variants within this
   six-dimensional space is not problematic. We argue that in terms of
   comprehensiveness, parsimony, independence of factors, and replicability
   across languages, our proposed six-factor model so far seems to be the
   optimal structure of personality characteristics. Copyright (C) 2002

BP 303
EP 318
PD 2002
PY 2002
AB A growing financing gap and the building up of unmet demands for
   improved quality of service and expanded coverage forced governments and
   public utilities to seek private capital, at home and abroad, through
   both debt and equity participation by the private sector. At the same
   time, technological progress and institutional innovations made possible
   wide private sector participation, ranging from management contracts
   through concessions to full-fledged privatization of energy, Water and
   sanitation utilities and state-owned public transport companies.
   During this time, the financial markets also evolved in conducive
   directions by developing new and innovative financing instruments that
   made possible the tapping of new sources of financing-insurance, pension
   funds and a variety of other institutional investors. The emergence of
   new forms of credit guarantees, the availability of instruments to
   finance private and municipal projects without sovereign guarantees, and
   the proliferation of new modalities for private-public sector
   partnerships opened up opportunities for resource mobilization and risk
   sharing which were not available to most developing countries a decade
   ago.
   While these innovative financing mechanisms have accessed new,
   previously inaccessible sources of funds for sector investments and, in
   combination with a more realistic pricing of services, have enhanced the
   financial sustainability of sectors such as power, water, sanitation,
   and transport, they have not necessarily enhanced environmental
   sustainability. Furthermore, despite the obvious similarities in the
   innovative financing instruments in these four sectors, there are also
   significant differences arising from both different sectoral features
   and historical reasons.
   This paper explores innovative instruments for sector financing,
   focusing particularly on energy, transport, water, sanitation, and
   forestry. It identifies the similarities and differences between
   different sectors, analyzes their implications for sustainable
   development and the potential for replicability in other sectors.

AB Most corneal topographers are slope-based instruments, measuring corneal
   slope based on light reflected by the cornea acting as a mirror. This
   mirror method limits corneal coverage to about 9 mm diameter. Both
   refractive surgery and contact lens fitting actually require a larger
   coverage than is obtainable using slope-based instruments. Height-based
   instruments should be able to measure a cornea/sclera area that is twice
   the size (four times the area) of slope-based topographers with an
   accuracy of a few microns. We have been testing a prototype of a new
   model height-based topographer manufactured by Euclid Systems. We find
   that single shots can produce a corneal coverage of up to 16 mm vertical
   and 20 mm horizontal. The heights and slopes in the corneal region have
   good replicability. Although the scleral region is noisier, it is the
   only topographer available able to measure scleral topography that is
   critically important to contact lens fitting. There are a number of
   improvements to the Euclid software and hardware that would enable it to
   fill an important niche in eye care and eye research.

   fragments was established. It was done using Gibco BRL kit for AFLP
   reactions and followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis together
   with silver staining, to obtain patterns of polymorphic DNA fragments.
   These plants were analysed using AFLP method and 70 polymorphic

AB The growing number of available transgenic and knockout mice has
   increased our understanding on the behavioral effects of specific
   proteins. Different methods should be encouraged for measuring
   sensorimotor functions, as genetic modifications often result in
   test-specific deficits. On the other hand, test standardization ensures
   a higher degree of interlaboratory replicability. For these reasons, the
   SHIRPA (GlaxoSmithKline/Harwell/Imperial College/Royal
   Hospital/Phenotype Assessment) protocol was used in the evaluation of
   NFH-LacZ transgenic mice, expressing a non-endogenous fusion protein
   between a truncated form of the mouse neurofilament heavy molecular
   weight subunit and the complete E. coli b-galactosidase. NFH-LacZ mice
   were compared to littermate controls of the DBA/2 strain in the SHIRPA
   primary screen as well as two motor activity and three coordination
   tests. NFH-LacZ transgenic mice could be distinguished from controls in
   the SHIRPA protocol by the appearance of action tremor and
   hindlimb-clasping and a lower body weight. Despite normal ambulation in
   an open-field and an activity chamber, NFH-LacZ transgenic mice were
   deficient in the stationary beam, coat-hanger, and rotorod tests. These
   results are concordant with neuropathological findings in spinal
   motoneurons and the cerebellum and indicate that despite the absence of
   paralysis, these transgenic mice may serve as an experimental model of
   the early stage of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

   stability of a new Greek Big Five personality measure (TPQue) across
   different samples in order to explore the suitability of the measure in
   personnel selection and assessment. The factor structure of the measure
   across three samples (students, employees, and job applicants) is
   examined. The results of exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses
   show that the five-factor structure remains intact for the students',
   the applicants' and the employees' samples - contrary to previous
   studies - with all the sub-scales of the personality measure (TPQue)
   loading on the intended factors. Furthermore, congruence coefficients
   between the samples justify the stability of the model in the working
   settings.

AB Species co-occurrences and interspecific associations between intensity
   of infection were studied in helminth communities of three populations
   of brown trout, Salmo trutta, from northern Italy. Of the eight helminth
   species, only four were common enough to be included in the analyses:
   Pomphorhynchus laevis, Acanthocephalus anguillae, Echinorhynchus truttae
   and Cyathocephalus truncates. The observed frequencies of co-occurrences
   of the different species, based on presence/absence data, did not differ
   from those predicted by a null model derived from prevalence data.
   However, the intensity of infection (number of individuals per fish) of
   different helminth species were generally, but not always significantly,
   negatively correlated in tests of pairwise associations. Variation in
   fish sizes and its effect on infection levels, and whether or not two
   helminth species used the same or different intermediate hosts, had no
   influence on these findings. Of the few significant negative
   associations found between pairs of helminth species, none was found in
   more than one fish population. This suggests that interspecific
   associations may be condition-dependent: even in apparently similar
   localities, the same combinations of helminth species show different
   associations. Without evidence of replicability, it is almost impossible
   to conclude to the consistent role of competition between any pair of
   helminth species in the field.

AB On the basis of eight independent quantitative trait loci (QTL) studies
   of ethanol (alcohol) preference drinking in mice, a meta-analysis was
   carried out to examine the replicability of QTLs across studies and to
   enhance the power of QTL detection and parameter estimation. To avoid
   genetic heterogeneity, we analyzed only studies of mapping populations
   derived from the C57BL/6 (B6) and DBA/2 (D2) inbred progenitor strains.
   Because these studies were carried out in five different laboratories,
   there were substantial differences in testing procedure, data analysis,
   and especially in the choice of mapping population (BXD recombinant
   inbred strains, F-2, backcross, selected lines, or congenic strains).
   Despite this, we found several QTLs that were sufficiently robust as to
   appear consistently across studies given the strengths and weaknesses of
   the mapping populations employed. These were on Chromosomes (Chrs) 2
   (proximal to mid), 3 (mid to distal), 4 (distal), and 9 (proximal to
   mid). The P value for each of these QTLs, combined across all applicable
   studies, ranged from 10(-7) to 10(-15), with the additive effect of each
   QTL accounting for 3-5% of the trait variance extrapolated to an F-2
   population. Two other QTLs on Chrs 1 (distal) and 11 (mid) were less
   consistent, but still reached overall significance (P < .0001).

AB Objectives: The relation of the mismatch negativity (MMN) elicitation
   with behavioral stimulus discrimination as well as the replicability of
   the MMN was evaluated for intervals between paired tones.
   Methods: The MMN, obtained in a passive oddball paradigm in two sessions
   separated by 4-21 days and behavioral responses (button presses to
   target stimuli) in a separate session were recorded from 10 adult
   healthy subjects. The standard stimulus (P = 0.79) was a tone pair
   separated by a 120 ms silent inter-stimulus interval (ISI) and the
   deviant stimuli were tone pairs with an ISI of 100, 60, and 20 ms (P =
   0.07 for each).
   Results: The 20 and 60 ms ISI deviant tone pairs elicited a significant
   MMN during both recording sessions and they were also behaviorally
   discriminated, whereas neither did the 100 ins ISI deviant pair elicit
   significant MMN nor was it behaviorally discriminated. Furthermore,
   there was a significant correlation between the MMN and reaction times
   to the 20 and 60 ins ISI deviant pairs. The 20 ins ISI deviant stimulus
   elicited highly replicable MMNs (r = 0.75), whereas the less well
   discriminated 60 ms ISI deviant pair did not (r = 0.60).
   Conclusions: The MMN reflects discrimination accuracy of temporal sound
   intervals, Furthermore, when the physical difference between the
   standard and deviant tone pair in the temporal domain is large, it is
   elicited with high reliability. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB Objectives. Prior studies have conceptualized and operationalized social
   support in different ways, making it difficult to determine if the
   inconsistencies in findings are due to differences in study design,
   samples, conceptualization, or measurement. The present study examined
   the replicability of models of social support and caregiver distress
   across 4 community-based caregiving studies representative of many
   conducted in the past 10 years. The goal was to identify areas of
   consistency in findings across the data sets.
   Methods. The authors analyzed 3 models specifying patterns of
   relationship between social support and depression (main effect.
   mediation effect, and moderation effect) separately within data sets
   using hierarchical ordinary least squares regression. Results were
   compared across data sets.
   Results. The replication analysis confirmed the robustness of behavior
   problems and caregiver health as important contributors to caregiver
   distress, Results of hypotheses examining the pattern of relationship
   between social support and distress were inconsistent, however. Only I
   type of social support was associated with distress in the expected
   direction: Less emotional support was associated with higher levels of
   distress in 2 of the 4 data sets.
   Discussion. More complex theoretical models that incorporate common
   measures to represent the linkages between types of stressor, types of
   support. and their interactions are needed to foster replicability and
   generalizability of research results.

AB One of the basic axioms of the rational theory of decision under
   uncertainty is Savage's (1954) Sure Thing Principle. It states that if

   if x is preferred to y knowing that A did not occur, then x should also
   be preferred to y when it is not known whether A occurred. Tversky and
   Shafir (1992) claim to have demonstrated a violation of this principle
   in two-step gambles, which is termed a disjunction effect. The present
   article evaluates the replicability of the disjunction effect for
   two-step gambles. The findings show that people do not violate the sure
   thing principle in repeated gambles. The validity of alleged violations
   in other paradigms is discussed. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

AB The ability of left-hemisphere stroke patients (n = 8) and healthy
   control subjects (n = 8) to process sounds preattentively and
   attentively was studied by recording auditory event-related potentials
   (ERPs) and behavioral responses. For the right-ear stimulation. the
   mismatch negativity (MMN) was significantly smaller in the patients than
   control subjects over both hemispheres. For the left-ear stimuli, the
   MMN was significantly smaller in the patient group than in the control
   group over the left hemisphere, whereas no group differences were
   obtained over the right hemisphere. In addition, the N1 amplitude was
   reduced bilaterally For the right-ear stimulation (with the reduction
   being larger over the left hemisphere). whereas no significant effects
   on the N1 amplitude were found for the left-ear stimulation.
   Behaviorally, the patients detected significantly fewer deviant tones
   than did the control subjects irrespective of the stimulated ear. The
   present results thus suggest that the long-latency ERPs can be used to
   probe such auditory processing deficits that are difficult to define
   with behavioral measures. Especially by recording MMN to monaural
   stimuli, the discrimination accuracy can be separately determined for
   the left and right temporal lobes.

   episode from the prime. These predictions were confirmed in Experiment
   1, using a gender decision task. Responses were slower when prime and

   Experiment 2 eliminated a possible explanation of the NP obtained in

AB A wide range of palaeoenvironmental evidence from the Holocene has
   suggested periodicities in the Earth's climate of 10s to 1000s of years.
   Identifying these millennial-, century- and decadal periodicities, and
   their impacts, is critical in developing a fuller understanding of
   natural climate variability. Any solar-induced climatic change needs to
   be distinguished from other causes of natural climate variability and
   from short-term catastrophic events induced either by external or
   internal processes. Such events might themselves generate a periodicity,
   or in combination with other forcing factors they may contribute towards
   a periodicity (and so spuriously imply a universal and continuing
   periodicity in the climate record), or they may resonate with a
   solar-induced periodicity. Here, evidence from peat records for
   periodicity in climate change over the mid to late Holocene is reviewed
   and this is followed by a test of the replicability of claimed
   periodicities using blanket peat data covering the past 2000 yr from
   four sites in the British Isles. Results suggest that the mires studied
   do go through phases of being responsive to periodic forcing factors,
   with ca. 200, ca. 80 and 60-50 yr wavelengths reflected in some data
   sets. However, the patterns shown are not consistent. This could be the
   result of local conditions at individual mires (human impact,
   sensitivity and vegetation succession) or of changes in the strength or
   nature of global forcing factors. Assessing a solar-mire link remains
   difficult because the century-scale variations of the Sun show different
   intervals between solar minima, the durations of which are themselves
   unequal, and because the proxy-climate data-sets from peat profiles may
   themselves not be dated with sufficient precision and/or accuracy.

   four biweekly sessions. Responses were elicited by a synthetically
   generated speech contrast (/dalpha/-/galpha/) that all listeners
   discriminated with at least 90 percent accuracy. Standard and deviant
   waveforms were replicable across sessions for all listeners; however,
   replicability of the derived difference waveforms was poor. Of greater
   importance, the MMN identification rate was too low (29%) to allow
   reliability to be evaluated. The implications that these findings may
   have on clinical applicability are discussed.

AB Objectives. To determine the usefulness of the bilirubin-albumin (B:A)
   molar ratio (MR) and unbound bilirubin (UB) as compared with serum total
   bilirubin (TB) in predicting bilirubin encephalopathy as assessed by
   auditory brainstem responses (ABR) in infants of 28 to 32 weeks'
   gestational age.
   Study Design. During a 2-year period, serial ABRs were obtained on 143
   infants of 28 to 32 weeks' gestational age during the first postnatal
   week. Waveforms were categorized on the basis of response replicability
   and the presence of waves III and V. Wave V latencies were also serially
   analyzed when measurable for individual infants. Maturation of the ABR
   was defined as abnormal when the waveform category worsened and/or
   latency increased during the study interval. Serum albumin was analyzed
   at 48 to 72 hours of age in all patients. Serum TB was analyzed as
   clinically indicated. Aliquots of the same samples were also analyzed
   for UB in a subset of infants.
   Results. The mean peak TB concentration (10.1 +/- 1.7 mg/dL) for the 71
   infants with normal ABR maturation was not significantly different from
   the mean peak TB (10.2 +/- 2.1 mg/dL) in the 24-hour period preceding
   the ABR's first showing abnormal maturation in the other 55 infants.
   However, in infants with UB analyzed, the mean peak UB (0.62 +/- 0.20 vs
   0.40 +/- 0.15 mg/dL) was significantly higher in the infants with
   abnormal maturation (n = 25) than in infants with normal maturation (n =
   20). The B:A MR results were equivocal. In the entire study population,
   there was no difference in B:A MR between infants with normal versus
   abnormal ABR maturation. However, in the subset of infants in whom UB
   was measured, although TB was not different, there was a significant
   difference in B:A MR. Based on receiver-operating characteristic curves,
   a UB level of 0.5 mg/dL was the best discriminator with a sensitivity of
   70% and a specificity of 75%. The proportion of infants who had UB >0.5
   mug/dL and UB less than or equal to0.5 mg/dL and who had abnormal ABR,
   maturation was 0.81 and 0.33, respectively, with a significant
   difference in the incidence of transient bilirubin encephalopathy among
   these 2 groups. The relative risk of abnormal ABR maturation with UB
   >0.5 mug/dL compared with UB less than or equal to0.05 mg/dL was 2.45
   (95% confidence interval: 1.33-4.49).
   Conclusions. UB is a more sensitive predictor than either serum
   bilirubin or B:A MR of abnormal ABR maturation, and hence transient
   bilirubin encephalopathy in premature newborns with hyperbilirubinemia.

AB For a better understanding of the acute pathogenicity of SHIV-89.6P
   stock virus. which induces prominent CD4 cell loss within a month after
   inoculation in monkeys, we have constructed four infectious molecular
   clones (cl 18, cl 64, cl 69, and cl 71). CI 64, cl 69, and cl 71, like
   the parental virus, showed a high in vitro replication ability and a
   pathogenic-like effect (CD4 downmodulation) in a monkey CD4(+) cell
   line, whereas cl 18 showed a lower replication ability and could not
   downmodulate CD4. Ci 64, which has characteristics similar to those of
   the parental virus in vitro, was inoculated into four rhesus monkeys.
   All monkeys showed a plasma viral load similar to that of the parental
   virus with a peak at 2 weeks after inoculation. However, the viral load
   gradually decreased and the virus failed to cause an AIDS-like disease
   in infected monkeys, but it induced a strong antiviral antibody
   response. These results demonstrate the polyclonal nature of the
   parental SHIV-89.6P virus stock and demonstrate that cl 64, aside from
   its high replicability, may differ qualitatively from the parental
   virus. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

AB In two daily diary studies rue examined the moderating role of sensation
   seeking in the patterns of relations between physical pleasure and life
   satisfaction. In study 1 (a 52-day daily diary study), daily physical
   pleasure was a significantly stronger predictor of daily social
   satisfaction among high sensation seekers than among low sensation
   seekers. We extended the finding of study I to more general daily,
   satisfaction in study 2 (a 23-day diary study). The present findings
   indicate that physical pleasure is associated with daily satisfaction to
   the degree that one seeks for such an experience. In addition, M,e
   tested whether the association between physical pleasure and daily
   satisfaction would be moderated also by other facets of extraversion and
   extraversion as a whole. With the exception of the positive emotion
   facet in study I, no facet or extraversion as a whole moderated the
   relation between physical pleasure and daily satisfaction. The present
   studies show specificity and replicability of the role that sensation
   seeking plays in understanding the link between daily physical pleasure
   and daily satisfaction, Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Testate amoebae analysis was undertaken on eight cores from three mires
   within a restricted geographical area of northern England. This was used
   to assess, first, the amount of autogenically produced variability in
   palaeohydrological records from ombrotrophic mires, and, second, to
   determine whether a palaeoclimatic signal can be derived from restate
   amoebae analysis from peatlands. Past mean annual water tables were
   reconstructed by calibrating the restate amoebae record with an existing
   transfer function. There is a good degree of replicability between the
   water table reconstructions for the upper peats within each site
   (especially since cal. AD 600) and the magnitude and timing of most
   changes are similar. The results show that autogenic factors have a
   relatively minor control on palaeohydrological records from ombrotrophic
   peatlands, even for marginal locations where these effects should be
   greatest. Records from the centres of peatlands are compared to assess
   the replicability of hydrological changes between the sites to determine
   which of these changes are attributable to climate. The major
   fluctuations are well replicated in all central cores, especially for
   the last 2000 years, suggesting that these shifts are climatically
   forced and that there is an increasing climatic influence through time,
   even at the valley mire site. Comparisons with other proxy climatic
   records suggest that mire surface wetness changes occurred in concert
   across a broad region of northern England and southern Scotland during
   at least the last 2000 years.

   & R. J. McNally, 1986) and the replicability, reliability, and validity
   of its dimensions in a nonclinical sample. One-thousand-and-seventy-one
   undergraduate volunteers completed the ASI and a modified version of the
   Panic Attack Questionnaire (PAQ; G. R. Norton, J. Dorward, & B. J. Cox,
   1986). A principal components analysis, using oblique rotation and
   parallel analysis, yielded three ASI dimensions that were highly
   consistent with those reported in previously published studies.
   Individuals classified as nonclinical panickers scored higher than
   nonpanickers on the Physical Concerns and Cognitive Concerns subscales
   of the ASI. Although spontaneous panic attacks were not significantly
   related to scores on any ASI scale, the occurrence of panic attacks in
   the past month was related to higher scores on the Cognitive Concerns
   subscale. The results are discussed in terms of cognitive theories of
   panic, and limitations of the present study and directions for future
   research are addressed.

AB Although disclosure is a component of many therapeutic approaches to
   treating the long-term symptoms associated with child sexual abuse
   (CSA), the ameliorative mechanisms of this approach are still unclear.
   This review investigates the expected benefits of disclosure in therapy
   by looking at the theoretical and empirical support for its
   effectiveness in treating the specific psychopathological sequelae
   associated with a history of CSA. In order to accomplish this task, a
   core group of sequelae associated with sexual abuse are presented. The
   components of disclosure as a therapeutic process are divided into three
   processes: disclosure-through-description,
   disclosure-through-rethinking, and disclosure-in-relationship. The
   review describes the ways in which these elements of disclosure are used
   within different therapeutic approaches. The treatment outcome
   literature is then reviewed in terms of the elements of disclosure
   included in the treatment approaches and the symptoms improved by
   treatment. In conclusion, implications are presented concerning the
   appropriate uses of disclosure in psychotherapy directed at alleviating
   the long-term sequelae associated with a history of CSA. (C) 2000

AB Micro- and mesocosms are frequently required in regulatory procedures of
   aquatic risk assessment for pesticides. However, many questions are
   still a matter of debate with regard to the use of these systems for
   environmental risk assessment, especially considering the inter-system
   variability of the measured parameters and its consequences on
   experimental design and data analysis. In this paper, variability of
   physico-chemical and biological parameters measured during two long-term
   experiments (8 to 9 months) in uncontaminated outdoor freshwater lentic
   mesocosms (8 m(3)) is analysed. Consequences on the design of
   ecotoxicity tests in mesocosms and on data analysis are also addressed.
   Water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen concentration and concentration
   of suspended solids exhibited a very low variability whereas nutrient
   concentrations displayed elevated levels of variability. Among
   biological parameters, those measured at the individual level were less
   variable than those measured at the community level. Functional
   descriptors frequently exhibited a lower inter-mesocosm variability than
   structural descriptors. Aggregation of data proved to significantly
   reduce inter-mesocosm variability. The results indicate that univariate
   statistical methods may be used for physico-chemical or species-level
   (e.g. biometric parameters) data which exhibit a moderate inter-mesocosm
   variability. The use of multivariate techniques is suggested for other
   levels of investigation. Nevertheless, variability is not sufficient to
   identify useful parameters. The sensitivity towards chemicals and
   ecological relevance of descriptors within the experimental context must
   also be considered.

AB Elucidating the genetic basis of adaptation on a genomewide scale has
   evaded biologists, but complete genome sequences and DNA high-density
   array technology make genomewide surveys more tractable. Six lines of
   Escherichia coli adapted for 2,000 generations to a stressful high
   temperature of 41.5 degreesC were examined on a genomewide scale for
   duplication/deletion events by using DNA high-density arrays. A total of
   five duplication and deletion events were detected. These five events
   occurred in three of the six lines, whereas the remaining three lines
   contained no detectable events. Three of the duplications were at 2.85
   Mb of the E. coli chromosome, providing evidence for the replicability
   of the adaptation to high temperature. Four candidate genes previously
   shown to play roles in stress and starvation survival were identified in
   the region of common duplication. Expression of the two candidate genes
   examined is elevated over expression levels in the ancestral lines or
   the lines without the duplication. In the two cases where the
   duplication at 2.85 Mb has been further characterized, the timing of the
   genome reorganization is coincident with significant increases in
   relative fitness. In both of these cases, the model for the origin of
   the duplication is a complex recombination event involving insertion
   sequences and repeat sequences. These results provide additional
   evidence for the idea that gene duplication plays an integral role in
   adaptation, specifically as a means for gene amplification.

AB Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is the researcher's
   workhorse for making inductive inferences. This method has often been
   challenged, has occasionally been defended, and has persistently been
   used through most Of the history of scientific psychology. This article
   reviews both the criticisms of NHST and the arguments brought to its
   defense. The review shows that the criticisms address the logical
   validity of inferences arising from NHST, whereas the defenses stress
   the pragmatic value of these inferences. The author suggests that both
   critics and apologists implicitly rely on Bayesian assumptions. When
   these assumptions are made explicit, the primary challenge for NHST-and
   any system of induction- can be confronted. The challenge is to find a
   solution to the question of replicability.

AB To prevent pressure ulcers in the seated user is important due to the
   severe consequences this phenomenon causes, both for the individual
   patient and from a social and economical perspective. The present
   literature study revealed that existing work within this area has been
   done without common methodological guidelines and procedures. An
   objective evaluation of seat cushions as preventive pressure ulcer
   development devices is, however, dependent on the establishment of
   common methodological guidelines. These should incorporate not only
   pressure measurements, but also measuremenets of other contributing
   factors; in particular shear, humidity and temperature, Improved
   replicability and thus comparability of experimental work is an absolute
   requirement if one is to build up a reference material within a field. A
   more solid base of fundamental knowledge than what we have today is thus
   required to improve the degree of objectivity and quality of individual
   adjustment of seat cushions.

AB Neural network topology selection refers to a systematic procedure for
   selecting between competing models. Naturally, it is regarded as a key
   aspect in optimisation and replicability of neural network performance.
   When constructing neural network topologies, it is necessary to
   determine from the outset the general taxonomy of the neural network
   architectures to be constructed. The taxonomy considered in this study
   is the general taxonomy of time-varying patterns which subsumes many
   existing architectures in the literature and points to several promising
   neural network architectures that have yet to be examined. The context
   of the problem is that choosing the right neural network topology for
   use in a particular domain such as corporate bankruptcy prediction with
   optimum generalisation performance is not, in any case, a trivial
   problem. The results of experiments presented in this paper would serve
   as a baseline against which to select between two competing
   architectures.

AB Mesocosms consisting of physically and biologically intact segments of
   natural communities are an ideal compromise between single species tests
   and ecosystem experiments in the assessment of sediment contamination.
   Therefore, large intact sediment cores, as mesocosms with naturally
   co-adapted communities, would allow sediment contamination to be
   assessed using the replicability and statistical power of laboratory
   techniques, while retaining much of the ecological realism of field
   studies. This study investigates the collection and maintenance of such
   cores, collected from an unimpacted site in Lake Erie. It demonstrates
   that box cores containing relatively undisturbed freshwater sediments
   can be brought back to the laboratory and maintained for up to 8 weeks
   with little change in the resident benthic fauna. Feeding the systems is
   not required, nor is it deleterious to the indigenous fauna. (C) 2001

AB The present study investigated the replicability of the factor structure
   of the Children's Perceived Self-Efficacy scales (CPSE; Bandura, 1990)
   in Italy, Hungary, and Poland. The findings of this cross-national study
   support the generalizability of the factor structure of children's
   social and academic efficacy. Perceived efficacy to resist peer pressure
   to engage transgressive conduct had a somewhat different factor
   structure for Hungarian children. Gender and national differences in the
   pattern of efficacy beliefs underscore the value of treating perceived
   self-efficacy as a multifaceted attribute. There were no overall gender
   differences in perceived social efficacy, but girls in all three
   societies have a higher sense of efficacy for academic activities and to
   resist peer pressure for transgressive activities. Italian children
   judge themselves more academically efficacious than do Hungarian
   children and more socially efficacious than their counterparts in both
   of the other two countries. An analysis of the facets of academic
   efficacy revealed that Hungarian children have a high sense of efficacy
   to master academic subjects but a lower efficacy than their Italian and
   Polish counterparts to take charge of their own learning. Polish
   children surpassed their counterparts in academic self-regulatory
   efficacy.

AB This paper extends the links between the non-parametric data envelopment
   analysis (DEA) models for efficiency analysis, duality theory and
   multi-criteria decision making models for the linear and non-linear
   case. By drawing on the properties of a partial Lagrangean relaxation, a
   correspondence is shown between the CCR, BCC and free disposable hull
   (FDH) models in DEA and the MCDM model. One of the implications is a
   characterization that verifies the sufficiency of the weighted
   scalarizing function, even for the non-convex case FDH. A linearization
   of FDH is presented along with dual interpretations. Thus, an
   input/output-oriented model is shown to be equivalent to a maximization
   of the weighted input/output, subject to production space feasibility.
   The discussion extends to the recent developments: the free
   replicability hull (FRH), the new elementary replicability hull (ERH)
   and the non-convex models by Petersen (1990). FRH is shown to be a true
   mixed integer program, whereas the latter can be characterized as the
   CCR and BCC models.

   of scarce health resources on medicines of doubtful therapeutic value,

   interventions at the community and patient s levels to improve the
   appropriate use of pharmaceuticals in developing nations. The authors
   analyze the contribution made by these studies and identify several
   limitations including the absence of independent evaluations of
   outcomes, lack of sufficient information to judge the quality and
   adequacy of the instruments used, problems relating to replicability of
   interventions at regional or country level, or outside the cultural
   context within which they took place, lack of information on costs of
   interventions, a crucial variable in poor countries, and the absence of
   standardized outcome measures that makes comparative analysis very

AB Current batteries for the phenotyping of inbred and knockout mice fail
   to discriminate among many genotypes. Results from different
   laboratories, furthermore, frequently disagree despite careful
   standardization of protocols. In recent years, detailed ethological
   studies revealed, however, that rodent locomotor behavior in a novel
   arena consists of typical patterns with a distinct structure. SEE (a
   Software for the Exploration of Exploration) has been developed by us
   for the automatic analysis of this structure. In this study we use SEE
   to analyze the locomotor behavior of two common inbred strains of mice,
   C57BL/6J and DBA/2J, in three laboratories. Results show high strain
   discrimination, which was replicated across laboratories using several
   endpoints that did not allow ranking of the two strains along a single
   dimension. For example, DBA/2J mice were consistently less active and
   ventured less into the arena's center, but also had a more "jittery"
   pattern of movement. Our results suggest that endpoints that were
   carefully tailored to capture innate behavior patterns are more likely
   to discriminate between different genotypes with higher replicability.
   15 additional commonly used inbred strains will be phenotyped in the
   near future, and a stand-alone version of the SEE software is freely
   available with protocols and database on the web.

   an allocation of scarce water resources where the output is lower as
   compared to what could have been accomplished with an alternative
   allocation. In essence, the effective use of water presumes a broad and
   lone-term perspective on societal development and environmental
   sustainability. Presentations illuminated that technical and

AB The paper describes the outcome of the joint Indonesia/Federal Republic
   of Germany Social Forestry Development Project (SFDP) which has the
   overall goal of contributing to "increasing the welfare of the local
   population in forest areas while maintaining the sustainability of the
   forest resource base". The project focuses on timber harvesting as an
   activity to potentially supplement community livelihoods and has shown
   that commercial harvesting of the natural forest by local communities is
   possible and can be mutually beneficial to all concerned. The strengths
   and weaknesses of community-based harvesting of the natural forest are
   assessed. Its strengths lie in the simplicity of the system and its
   capability to be satisfactorily implemented by the target group. As
   such, the system itself would appear to be sufficiently robust to be
   adaptable to most situations, regardless of country, culture or
   tradition. Its weakness lies in the vulnerability of the system to those
   external factors that set the framework conditions in which the system
   is to be applied. The usefulness and replicability, both inside and
   outside of Indonesia, of the approach as a system that can provide
   opportunities to improve community livelihood and welfare largely
   depends on the support of the respective governments for community-based
   forest management, and their readiness to create compatible frameworks
   for their implementation. New investigation is required into how policy
   and institutional change can be made to improve governance at all
   levels, in order to motivate and support community based initiatives.

PY 2001
AB Perhaps one reason for the failure to consistently find encoding-related
   activity in the hippocampus is the complexity of neuronal activity in
   this structure: Electrophysiological studies have shown both transient
   and sustained increases and decreases in hippocampal activity during
   encoding conditions. Here, using event-related fMRI, with appropriate
   modeling, we delimit a system of interconnected left medial temporal
   lobe structures that showed complex BOLD signal changes specific to
   verbal encoding. During scanning, 8 participants viewed 50 nouns; each
   was presented for 2 s. Encoding was incidental. This was confirmed at
   debriefing. Recognition was tested using a two-alternative forced-choice
   procedure. Whole brain 2D spiral functional images were acquired with
   the following parameters: TE=40 ms, TR=2s, FA=85degree, FOV=300 mm.
   Voxel-based t-statistics were generated with SPM99 by contrasting the
   signal associated with subsequently recognized versus subsequently
   forgotten words. A discrete left medial temporal region-including the
   hippocampus proper-showed significant signal changes associated with
   encoding words. For subsequently recognized items, the time course in
   the hippocampus was characterized by a brief increase followed by a
   sustained decrease in signal. A conjunction analysis was used to
   determine the replicability of these results. This analysis demonstrated
   encoding-related changes in the left anterior hippocampus and the
   adjacent periamygdalar region common to all participants. Our results
   indicate that complex signal changes in the hippocampus are a typical
   feature of encoding.

AB Gauthier et al. (2000) argue that the right fusiform face area (fFFA)
   can be activated not only by faces but also by nonface stimuli that the
   subject is expert at discriminating, e.g. cars for car experts. The
   magnitude of this activation was well below the response to faces in the
   rFFA. Nonetheless, if replicable this result is potentially important in
   implicating the rFFA not only on the processing of faces but also on
   nonface expert stimuli. Most of the subjects in the original study were
   scanned at 1.5 T with relatively low spatial resolution (7 mm thick
   slices), leaving open the possibility that nearby but distinct cortical
   regions may have been responsible for the small expertise effects
   observed. Further, only blocked designs were used, so the result may
   have in part reflected attentional or strategic differences between
   conditions. Given the considerable attention this study has received, it
   was deemed worthwhile to attempt a replication. We scanned bird and car
   experts with higher spatial resolution (a 3T scanner and 4-5 mm slices)
   using event-related designs. Specifically, in localizer runs, blocks of
   images belonging to different categories (faces, objects, birds, cars,
   scenes, and scrambled objects) were presented, and regions of interest
   were identified. In subsequent event-related runs subjects carried out a
   location-detection task on stimuli from the same categories. We will
   report the response in each ROIs to each of these categories in an
   effort to evaluate the replicability, magnitude and theoretical
   significance of any responses to expert stimuli in the FFA and elsewhere
   in extrastriate cortex.

AB Action research programmes conducted at various pilot sites in Pakistan
   found that organizing water users at the secondary level of Pakistan's
   contiguous canal irrigation system was socially feasible. This was
   contrary to the popular belief that existed both within and outside
   Pakistan. The popular notions, which were related to constraints of an
   integrated socio-technical system, illiterate farmers, social pressure
   from big landowners, and obstacles caused by the hierarchical society,
   were proven to be invalid under conditions of a participatory process of
   social organization. The methodologies used had the common focus on
   building self-reliance among the farmers, and using field training and
   other forms of capacity building as the major motivating influences. A
   field implementation coordination committee consisting of
   representatives of all service delivery agencies working in the area,
   along with selected water users, highlighted the needed farmer-agency
   coordination, and greatly facilitated an incentive mechanism through
   collaborative activities within the pilot sites. This combined effort
   successfully achieved the formation of a number water users' association
   at the tertiary (watercourse) level and a few water users' federations
   (WUFs) at the secondary canal (distributary) level at the selected pilot
   sites. The emerging results of this social experiment are encouraging.
   The new WUFs were able to take collective decisions to negotiate with
   state irrigation authorities regarding joint management agreements
   (JMAs) for managing water resources in the canal system. Although the
   JMAs were not made immediately effective due to a procedural difficulty
   imposed by the present legal framework, the WUFs proceeded to test their
   capacity in undertaking a planned maintenance programme during the canal
   closure period, and also initiating a maintenance-related infrastructure
   improvement programme. Replicability of this social organization
   programme lies in the methodology adopted: the deployment of small field
   teams and the use of local volunteers. The step-wise social organization
   process is meant to enhance sustainable interest of all the actors
   involved. One drawback in the pilot efforts, however, has been the lack
   of full commitment from related government agencies, which have to take
   the initiative for empowering the water users' organizations. However,
   both the enthusiasm and the capacity demonstrated by the water users in
   social organization for collective action are considerable, and show a
   good potential for further progress. Very likely, the demand generated
   at the local level could facilitate a process of bureaucratic
   reorientation, which in turn would provide the necessary institutional
   support for the new water users' organizations.

AB Context Although home-based health care has grown over the past decade,
   its effectiveness remains controversial. A prior trial of Veterans
   Affairs (VA) Team-Managed Home-Based Primary Care (TM/HBPC) found
   favorable outcomes, but the replicability of the model and
   generalizability of the findings are unknown.
   Objectives To assess the impact of TM/HBPC on functional status,
   health-related quality of life (HR-QoL), satisfaction with care, and
   cost of care.
   Design and Setting Multisite randomized controlled trial conducted from
   October 1994 to September 1998 in 16 VA medical centers with HBPC
   programs.
   Participants A total of 1966 patients with a mean age of 70 years who
   had 2 or more activities of daily living impairments or a terminal
   illness, congestive heart failure (CHF), or chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease (COPD).
   Intervention Home-based primary care (n=981), including a primary care
   manager, 24-hour contact for patients, prior approval of hospital
   readmissions, and HBPC team participation in discharge planning, vs
   customary VA and private sector care (n=985).
   Main Outcome Measures Patient functional status, patient and caregiver
   HR-QoL and satisfaction, caregiver burden, hospital readmissions, and
   costs over 12 months.
   Results Functional status as assessed by the Barthel Index did not
   differ for terminal (P=.40) or nonterminal (those with severe disability
   or who had CHF or COPD) (P=.17) patients by treatment group. Significant
   improvements were seen in terminal TM/HBPC patients in HR-QoL scales of
   emotional role function, social function, bodily pain, mental health,
   vitality, and general health. Team-Managed HBPC nonterminal patients had
   significant increases of 5 to 10 points in 5 of 6 satisfaction with care
   scales. The caregivers of terminal patients in the TM/HBPC group
   improved significantly in HR-QoL measures except for vitality and
   general health. Caregivers of nonterminal patients improved
   significantly in QoL measures and reported reduced caregiver burden
   (P=.008). Team-Managed HBPC patients with severe disability experienced
   a 22% relative decrease (0.7 readmissions/patient for TM/HBPC group vs
   0.9 readmissions/patient for control group) in hospital readmissions
   (P=.03) at 6 months that was not sustained at 12 months. Total mean per
   person costs were 6.8% higher in the TM/HBPC group at 6 months ($19 190
   vs $17 971) and 12.1% higher at 12 months ($31 401 vs $28 008).
   Conclusions The TM/HBPC intervention improved most HR-QoL measures among
   terminally ill patients and satisfaction among non-terminally ill
   patients. It improved caregiver HR-QoL, satisfaction with care, and
   caregiver burden and reduced hospital readmissions at 6 months, but it
   did not substitute for other forms of care. The higher costs of TM/HBPC
   should be weighed against these benefits.

AB In a multi-season, multi-lake study of epilithic diatom communities,
   glass slide artificial substrate samplers provided poor representation
   of communities on natural substrates. Percent similarities between the
   two communities averaged only 37 over the course of the study. Overall,
   natural substrates exhibited greater species richness than artificial
   samplers, particularly during the summer, although this difference was
   slight. Patterns of selection and inhibition by artificial substrates of
   individual diatom species varied by both season and lake. Members of the
   genus Cymbella, particularly C. microcephala, appeared to be the most
   consistently inhibited, while Achnanthes minutissima was often selected
   for. In spite of the great differences between the two substrate types,
   replicability of artificial substrates was very high, and could prove to
   be a more important quality in monitoring applications than accurate
   representation of the natural community.

AB Rabbit antilymphocyte or antithymocyte globulins (rATG) are currently
   used as immunosuppressive agents in clinical organ and bone marrow
   transplantation, but because of differences in antigen source and
   purification processes between manufacturers, determination of the dose
   to be administered remains empirical. Dosage may be adjusted to
   peripheral blood T cell counts or limited by side effects such as
   neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. We report here a measurement by
   indirect immunofluorescence of the amount of antibodies from rATG that
   bind to different blood cell types. A concentration-related
   immunofluorescence signal was obtained with reasonable replicability,
   allowing comparison of different rATGs by reference to the same rATG
   batch as internal standard. Ratios of antilymphocyte to undesirable
   antibodies (directed against antigens expressed on neutrophils,
   platelets or red cells) could be calculated for each rATG preparation.
   Finally, the method is applicable to the measurement of free antibodies
   in sera from patients treated with rATG and to the analysis of the
   effects of in vivo absorption of rATG during its administration. Marked
   differences in antibody content per mg of rIgG account for the
   differences in rATG dosage that were empirically established for
   clinical applications. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

AB The proliferative capability is time-limited in normal somatic cells by
   the shortening of their chromosomal ends, the telomeres (Hayflick
   limit). An important feature of malignant cells is their immortality.
   The probably most common mechanism of tumour cells to achieve unlimited
   replicability is the activation of the enzyme telomerase. The reverse
   transcriptase can compensate the loss of telomeres. Using a PCR-based
   TRAP assay we found telomerase activity in tumour biopsies, exsudates
   and bronchial washings in various thoracic malignancies. In 38 of 47
   patients with suspected peripheral lung cancer eventually surgery or
   invasive procedures proved a malignancy. In fluoroscopically guided
   bronchial brushings from 25 of these 38 patients (66%) the TRAP assay
   revealed telomerase activity. There was a single false positive case
   (tuberculosis) and with a single exception, the simultaneously taken
   brushes of the contralateral lobes were all telomerase negative. In 23
   patients (61%) tumour cells were found in the cytological examination.
   In 33 patients at least one marker was positive. Thus the combination of
   cytology and telomerase test in bronchial brush biopsies attained a
   diagnostic yield of 87%.

   several studies focusing on electrophysiologic function in
   schizophrenia. Also, several lines of evidence suggest a similarity
   between schizophrenia and schizotypal personality disorder (SPD), This
   study was undertaken to determine the replicability of our previous
   finding of a left-lateralized P3 amplitude deficit in SPD.
   Methods: We recorded event-related potentials in 21 SPD and 18 normal
   control subjects in an auditory "oddball" P3 paradigm.
   Results: In the SPD subjects, but not in the control subjects, there was
   lower P3 amplitude at T3 compared with T4.
   Conclusions: These results are similar to the ones in our previous work
   and further support the presence of a left-lateralized P3 deficit in
   SPD. (C) 2000 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

AB Methanogenic bioreactor communities mere used as model ecosystems to
   evaluate the relationship between functional stability and community
   structure. Replicated methanogenic bioreactor communities with two
   different community structures were established. The effect of a
   substrate loading shock on population dynamics in each microbial
   community was examined by using morphological analysis, small-subunit
   (SSU) rRNA oligonucleotide probes, amplified ribosomal DNA (rDNA)
   restriction analysis (ARDRA), and partial sequencing of SSU rDNA clones.
   One set of replicated communities, designated the high-spirochete (HS)
   set, was characterized by good replicability, a high proportion of
   spiral and short thin rod morphotypes, a dominance of spirochete-related
   SSU rDNA genes, and a high percentage of Methanosarcina-related SSU
   rRNA. The second set of communities, designated the low-spirochete (LS)
   set, was characterized by incomplete replicability, higher morphotype
   diversity dominated by cocci, a predominance of Streptococcus-related
   and deeply branching Spirochaetales-related SSU rDNA genes, and a high
   percentage of Methanosaeta-related SSU rRNA. In the HS communities,
   glucose perturbation caused a dramatic shift in the relative abundance
   of fermentative bacteria, with temporary displacement of
   spirochete-related ribotypes by Eubacterium-related ribotypes, followed
   by a return to the preperturbation community structure. The LS
   communities were less perturbed, with Streptococcus-related organisms
   remaining prevalent after the glucose shock, although changes in the
   relative abundance of minor members were detected by morphotype
   analysis. A companion paper demonstrates that the more stable LS
   communities were less functionally stable than the HS communities (S. A.

AB The elevated plus-maze has been used in animal research to measure
   anxiety since 1985 and is currently the most widely used animal model of
   anxiety. Since this paradigm has been the subject of several principal
   components analyses, it is well qualified for confirmatory factor
   analysis research. The current report builds on the substantial
   theoretical knowledge and empirical data obtained from these structural
   analyses with a view to obtain further progress in the evolution of our
   understanding of animal anxiety in the elevated plus-maze. The purpose
   of the present report was two-fold: (a) to test if the a piori
   imposition of a 3-factor model, or a competing 2-factor elevated
   plus-maze model, would fit our sample (n = 200 CD-1 mice) data in each
   of two trials within an inferential confirmatory factor analytic
   framework; (b) provide a well-fitting model that confers indicator
   variables that can most effectively and parsimoniously measure
   underlying constructs of elevated plus-maze behaviour. Multiple
   model-fitting criteria were used, and issues related to data
   non-normality, outliers, replicability of the model, sampling error and
   error of approximation ill the estimation of final model fit were
   addressed. The final 2-factor model, with estimated error covariance
   between two different pairs of indicator variables, was a good fit on
   the trial-1 data, although it was necessary to allow unprotected stretch
   attends to non-significantly cross-load on factor-2. A 2-factor model
   also fit the trial-2 data from the present analysis, although it was
   necessary to allow closed arm time ratio to negatively cross-load on
   factor-1. These results indicate that inferential hypothesis testing and
   model building procedures within a confirmatory factor analysis
   framework produces interpretable animal anxiety indices in the elevated
   plus-maze. Moreover, a 2-factor, rather than a 3-factor model,
   parsimoniously and unambiguously explained the underlying constructs of
   anxiety-like mouse behaviour in the elevated plus-maze in the present
   study. Taken together, a reduction in the growing number of behavioural
   indices reported in elevated plus-maze pharmacological studies is
   suggested. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The paper is an attempt to revisit the practice of cost recovery in the
   context of urban low-income housing. The discourse begins by outlining
   the arguments for cost recovery in low-income housing projects. The
   discussion acknowledges that the principle of cost recovery is central
   to the establishment of replicable housing projects and sustainable
   housing finance systems. The paper then explores the salient issues in
   the principle of cost recovery. These are explored from the standpoint
   of the financier and the borrower. It is pointed out that the financier
   has obligations and responsibilities to depositors and shareholders. The
   paper then argues that awareness of obligations and responsibilities
   should be accompanied by practices and procedures that institutionalise
   and promote cost recovery. Regarding the borrowers the paper highlights
   the importance of their circumstances within the broader macro-economic
   sphere. It is then argued that the mode of cost recovery as reflected in
   the terms of repayment should as much as possible suit the situation and
   requirements of both the borrower and the lender. The discussion then
   introduces the role of "outsiders" in cost recovery and how politicians
   and busybodies can frustrate the efforts of the financier to recover
   funds invested in housing. The implications of cost recovery are then
   drawn out. In this case replicability and investor confidence are
   emphasised. The results of obsessions with cost recovery are also
   outlined. These points are then illustrated by examples from urban
   low-income housing in Zimbabwe. The study concludes by cautioning that
   the critical issues involved in cost recovery are not exclusively
   financial, technical and managerial. Most of the crucial issues relate
   institutional practices and procedures in the face of a multiplicity of
   direct and indirect stakeholders involved. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY

EP 611
PD FAL 2000

AB Bill measurement is important in many feeding studies. Traditionally,
   two alternative bill measures have been proposed: bill length measured
   from the tip to skull (i.e., total culmen), mainly used in Europe, and
   bill length measured from the tip to the anterior edge of nostrils, used
   both in Europe and America. However, the correlation between both
   measures as well as the analysis of what they are in fact measuring have
   not been explored yet. The aim of this paper is to test in the Citril
   Finch (Serinus citrinella) whether measurement of bill length from the
   tip to the anterior edge of nostrils and total culmen are measuring
   different components of bill length (e.g., ramphotheca vs. premaxilla),
   and to assess which is the best measure in relation to their measurement
   error. This is specially relevant in granivorous birds for which total
   culmen length differs from ramphotheca length. The correlation between
   bill length to nostrils and total culmen was moderate (r = 0.75).
   Multiple regression of total culmen (dependent variable) on the bill
   components included ramphotheca length (R-2 = 52%) and marginally
   premaxilla length to nostrils (R-2 change = 6%, P = 0.06). When using
   bill length to nostrils as dependent variable it also included
   ramphotheca length (R-2 = 60%) and premaxilla length to nostrils (R-2
   change = 16%, P 0.001). Measurement error was low for bill length to
   nostrils (ME = 1.6%) but high for total culmen (ME = 26.3%), making the
   latter measure not reliable. The replicability of total culmen is
   probably decreased in granivorous birds, compared to other passerines,
   by the fact that in these species the abrupt edge of the ramphotheca
   differs from the point at which the culmen meets the skull, which
   hinders the location of the end of culmen. All of this highly recommends
   that, specially in granivorous birds, the length of bill should be
   measured from nostril. Our results also show that both bill length
   measures are mainly measuring ramphotheca.

AB Objective. To determine whether brainstem maturation as measured by
   brainstem auditory-evoked responses (BAERs) in preterm infants is a
   function of dietary intake.
   Study Design. We obtained serial BAERs on infants 28 to 32 weeks'
   gestation at birth, cared for in the neonatal intensive care unit of a
   regional referral center in Upstate New York. Waveforms were analyzed
   for replicability and for the presence of waves III and V. Absolute and
   interwave latencies were measured. Baseline and follow-up BAER
   measurements were compared, and the rates of change were calculated.
   Patient charts were reviewed for type of enteral feeding during the
   interval between BAERs. Student's t test was used to analyze continuous
   variables and chi(2) analysis was used to analyze categorical variables.
   Results. Data from 37 study infants (17 fed breast milk and 20 fed
   commercial premature formula) revealed that there was no difference in
   absolute latencies of waves III and V at baseline; however, the rates of
   decrease of absolute latencies over the study interval were
   significantly greater in infants receiving human milk.
   Conclusions. Infants fed breast milk have faster brainstem maturation,
   compared with infants fed formula, based on the rate of maturation of
   BAERs. This effect may be attributable to the constituent composition of
   breast milk, compared with synthetic formulas.

AB Background: Study of the contribution of retrospective perceptions of
   dysfunctional parenting in relation to adult psychopathology has been
   greatly facilitated by the development of the 25-item Parental Bonding
   Instrument (PBI; Parker et al. 1979). Method: The present study employed
   confirmatory factor analytic techniques to evaluate competing models of
   the basic dimensions underlying different versions of the PBI, in a
   psychiatric sample from a mood disorders program and with a new
   modification of the PBI employed in the US National Comorbidity Survey.
   Results: The results indicated that a three-factor model originally
   identified in a 16-item version of the PBI modified for epidemiological
   research (Kendler 1996) showed the best fit to the data. The three
   dimensions of care, overprotection, and authoritarianism also explained
   the underlying structure of the NCS-modified, eight-item PBI that is now
   part of the NCS public use dataset available to psychopathology
   researchers. Conclusions: The replicability of findings across gender,
   age, and clinical versus community samples attests to the robustness of
   this three-factor structure of parenting styles.

AB Objective: To test the cultural invariance of the Impact-on-family Scale
   in order to make cross-cultural comparisons.
   Methods: The Italian version of the scale was administered to mothers of
   children with chronic illnesses. Factorial invariance was examined to
   investigate whether the four factors found with the original United
   States (U.S.) scale could be replicated.
   Results: The results clearly demonstrate the replicability of the first
   three factors, Financial Burden, Familial/Social Impact, and Personal
   Strain. In addition, internal consistency and the homogeneity of the
   items of the corresponding scales are satisfactory. However, the fourth
   factor, Mastery, could not be replicated, and the reliability of the
   corresponding scale is poor. Italian mothers scored significantly lower
   on the Financial Burden and on the Familial/Social Impact dimension,
   compared to the American sample.
   Conclusions: Three of the four factors of the Impact-on-family Scale are
   useful for cross-cultural comparisons between U.S. and Italian samples.

AB More than 250 million of the world's children suffer from vitamin A
   deficiency. Nepal is one of 60 countries in which this deficiency
   constitutes a significant public health problem. Each year in Nepal,
   vitamin A deficiency is responsible for the deaths of 9000 children and
   for 2500 children becoming permanently blind. The Nepal National Vitamin
   A Program (NVAP) was begun in 1993 in eight of the country's 75
   districts. By the end of 1997, the programme covered 32 districts, and
   by 2003 its coverage will be nationwide.
   The Nepal NVAP is considered by many to be a highly successful, model
   programme. It consists primarily of distributing high-dose vitamin A
   capsules to all children 6 to 60 months of age during twice-yearly
   campaigns. The capsule distribution is carried out by a previously
   existing network of Female Community Health Volunteers (FCHVs) that has
   been reinvigorated by the highly visible and universally acclaimed
   success of the NVAP. An important strategy of the programme has been the
   empowerment of the FCHVs, which has been accomplished by organizing,
   training and motivating community workers and other representatives from
   education, agriculture and other sectors, as well as political
   representatives, to support the FCHVs.
   The annual cost of the NVAP is US$1.7 million. It costs $1.25 to deliver
   two vitamin A capsules to each participant. The cost per averted death
   is $327. The NVAP reduces the incidence and severity of diarrhoeal
   disease and measles, which in turn reduces the need for Ministry of
   Health services, thereby annually saving the Government of Nepal $1.5
   million. Factoring in these cost savings, the net annual cost of the
   current NVAP is $167 000, and the net annual cost of the permanent,
   nationwide programme is estimated at $1.1 million. The NVAP is a highly
   cost-effective programme. The article concludes with a discussion of the
   sustainability and replicability of the programme.

AB Two studies were conducted to explore the reasons why replicable
   individual-difference correlates of empathic accuracy have proved so
   difficult to find. In Study I, we examined sources of variance in
   empathic accuracy data using the Social Relations Model (Kenny, 1988,
   1994; Kenny & Albright, 1987; Malloy & Kenny, 1986). The results
   revealed substantial perceiver Variance only in the type of research
   design in which a relatively large set of individual perceivers inferred
   the thoughts and feelings of the same set of target persons. In Study 2,
   we found evidence that even in this apparently optimal type of research
   design, the significant individual-difference correlates of empathic
   accuracy were fewer and subject to more unexpected qualifications than
   the results of Davis and Kraus's (1997) meta-analysis would suggest. So
   far, the "best candidate" predictor of empathic accuracy appears to be
   Verbal intelligence, but it remains to be seen whether it and two other
   recently proposed predictors of interpersonal accuracy will survive the
   test of replicability.

AB In this article, we examine universal and culture-specific aspects of
   the Five-Factor Model measured with the Revised NEO Personality
   Inventory. First, our purpose was to rest the replicability of the
   original (North American) factor structure in the Estonian-speaking
   population. The translation was administered to 711 Estonian men and
   women aged 18 to 82, When the 30 facet scales were factored, parallel
   analysis suggested that Jive components should be retained. In the
   interpersonal plane defined by Extraversion and Agreeableness factors,
   Estonian facets formed a semicircular array that resembled the American
   pattern at a distance of about 21 degrees. After these axes were aligned
   by Procrustes rotation, all five factor congruences exceeded 0.96,
   providing further evidence that the underlying five-factor structure of
   the personality instrument is replicable in languages and cultures which
   differ substantially from those in which it was originally identified
   Second we tested the hypothesis that the orientation of varimax axes in
   the interpersonal plane is associated with the culture's degree of
   individualism-collectivism. We calculated the angular degree of
   difference between E and A factors in the American sample and in 21
   other available samples, correlated it with individualism ratings, and
   found mixed support for the hypothesis, suggesting that continued

AB Study objective-To test the validity of proxy measures of household
   wealth and income that can be readily implemented in health surveys in
   rural Africa.
   Design-Data are drawn from four different integrated household surveys.
   The assumptions underlying the choice of wealth proxy are described, and
   correlations with the true value are assessed in two different settings.
   The expenditure proxy is developed and then tested for replicability in
   two independent datasets representing the same population.
   Setting-Rural areas of Mali, Malawi, and Cote d'Ivoire (two national
   surveys).
   Participants-Random sample of rural households in each setting (n=275,
   707, 910, and 856, respectively).
   Main results-In both Mali and Malawi, the wealth proxy correlated highly
   (r greater than or equal to 0.74) with the more complex monetary value
   method. For rural areas of Cote d'Ivoire, it was possible to generate a
   list of just 10 expenditure items, the values of which when summed
   correlated highly with expenditures on all items combined (r=0.74,
   development dataset, r=0.72, validation dataset). Total household
   expenditure is an accepted alternative to household income in developing
   country settings.
   Conclusions-It is feasible to approximate both household wealth and
   expenditures in rural African settings without dramatically lengthening
   questionnaires that have a primary focus on health outcomes.

   on the Transtheoretical Model of Change. Two of the model's intervention
   approaches, tailoring to Stage-of-Change and creating completely
   individualized interventions; have already been developed and
   implemented in previous research. A third intervention approach, in
   between stage-tailored and individualized, is targeting subtype groups
   within each Stage of Change. The subtype targeted intervention approach
   is in the initial development stage of empirically determining and
   validating the stage subtypes. Three studies are presented which
   investigate stage subtypes within a representative sample of 4,144
   smokers in the Precontemplation, Contemplation, and Preparation Stages
   of Change. Within each Stage-of-Change study, two cluster analyses were
   performed using the Pros, Cons, and Situational Temptations from the
   Transtheoretical Model to establish cluster replicability. Cluster
   solutions were externally validated using the 10 Processes of Change and
   2 smoking behavior variables. Four distinct subtypes were found in
   Precontemplation and Contemplation, and five subtypes were found in
   Preparation. These subtypes closely replicate subtypes previously found
   in a convenience sample of smokers and provide strong evidence for the
   existence of subtypes within the first three Stages of Change. (C) 2000

AB Objectives: The individual replicability of the mismatch negativity
   (MMN) event-related brain potential (ERP) was studied at two different
   inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs), to establish its potential value for
   routine clinical evaluation of sound discrimination and auditory sensory
   memory.
   Methods: Ten healthy young subjects were presented sequences of 3
   stimulus trains, in two recording sessions approximately 1 month apart.
   The stimuli in the trains were delivered at an ISI of 300 ms, whereas
   the inter-train intervals (ITIs) were 0.4 s and 4.0 s in different
   blocks. ERPs were averaged to standard (75 ms) and deviant (25 ms) tones
   started equiprobably the stimulus trains.
   Results: Significant Pearson product-moment correlations coefficients
   were found between sessions at all scalp locations fur the short ITI,
   when the MMN was quantified as the mean amplitude in the 100-200 ms
   latency window around its peak, However. none of the correlations
   reached significance for the longer ITI.
   Conclusions: MMN appears ro be a reliable measure for single-case
   assessment and follow-ups when obtained at short ISIs and quantified as
   an integrated window of neuroelectric activation over a temporal span.

   relevant field of theoretical physics during the earliest period of the

   theorists can be very like the work of experimentalists. Concepts such
   as 'tacit knowledge', and problems of replicability, may be just as
   relevant to the study of theorists as they are to experimenters. In
   analogy with Collins' 'Experimenters' Regress', I propose the existence
   of a 'Theoreticians' Regress' which expresses the difficulty theorists
   have in judging the correctness of rival calculations when the best or

   duration changes in a series of repetitive tones and to two different
   consonant-vowel syllables (ba and ga, standard da) were recorded in a
   test and retest session in 15 children aged 7-11 years. Reliability
   within one session and stability between the sessions of MMN amplitudes
   and the ERP-components P1 and N1 were determined by correlation
   coefficients.
   Results: Mean amplitudes of the grand averages showed a decrease of MMN
   during the second test session in a late latency window (400-500 ms) for
   the frequency MMN and of the MMN elicited by speech stimuli. The
   individual stability reached significance only for the duration deviant
   and one of the syllables. Compared to results found in adults with
   similar stimulus conditions the stability of the MMN in children seems
   to be somewhat lower. The components P1 and N1 to both stimulus types
   (tone and speech), however, showed a high reliability and individual
   stability.
   Conclusion: While MMN is a useful tool to study processing deficits in
   groups of children, as e.g. in language-impaired children, MMN as a
   individual diagnostic measure should be interpreted very cautiously. (C)

AB Neurodegenerative diseases, traumatic brain injury and stroke are likely
   to result in cognitive dysfunctioning. Animal models are needed in which
   these deficits and recovery of the affected functions can be
   investigated. In the present study, the entorhinal area was chosen as
   the target for lesioning and for assessing the lesion-induced deficits
   in the Morris water maze. The entorhinal cortex is regarded as an
   interface between the hippocampus and neocortex. Deafferentiating the
   hippocampus through entorhinal lesions impairs spatial learning. The
   effects of lesions, induced by either electrocoagulation (experiment 1)
   or ibotenate excitotoxicity (experiment 2), on spatial orientation
   behaviour were investigated. Water maze performance after unilateral or
   bilateral ibotenate injections into the entorhinal cortex was studied in
   the third experiment. In an additional study, the replicability of the
   spatial learning deficit after lesions induced by bilateral injections
   of ibotenic acid into the entorhinal cortex was assessed by comparing
   the results of nine experiments. We found that spatial learning was
   impaired after bilateral lesions aimed at the entorhinal cortex. The
   electrolytic lesion technique produced a relatively large sham effect,
   whereas the excitotoxic lesioning method did not. Unilateral injections
   of ibotenic acid into the entorhinal cortex did not affect spatial
   navigation. The ibotenate induced lesions replicably produced deficits
   in the Morris tasks. The degree of the induced spatial learning
   impairments and the effects on the rate of acquisition during training,
   however, differed between experiments. This result suggests that the
   fundamental biological diversity between shipments of rats can account
   for variation in the effects of parahippocampal damage on spatial
   learning even in highly standardized experimental set-ups.
   Rats lesioned by bilateral injections of ibotenic acid into the
   entorhinal cortex provide an interesting and reliable model for
   investigating cognitive dysfunctions in neurodegenerative diseases,
   stroke or traumatic brain injury. (C) 2000 IBRO. Published by Elsevier

AB Multilevel Fiduccia-Mattheyses (MLFM) hypergraph partitioning is a
   fundamental optimization in VLSI CAD physical design. The leading
   implementation, hMetis, has since 1997 proved itself substantially
   superior in both runtime and solution quality to even very recent work.
   In this work, we present two sets of results: (i) new techniques for
   flat FM-based hypergraph partitioning (which is the core of multilevel
   implementations), and (ii) a new multilevel implementation that offers
   leading-edge performance. Our new techniques for flat partitioning
   confirm the conjecture that specialized partitioning heuristics may be
   able to actively exploit fixed nodes in partitioning instances arising
   in the driving top-down placement context. Our FM variant is competitive
   with traditional FM on instances without terminals and considerably
   superior on instances with fixed nodes (i.e., arising during top-down
   placement). Our multilevel FM variant avoids several complex heuristics
   and non-trivial tunings that often lead to complex implementations; it
   achieves trade-offs between solution quality and run time that are
   comparable or better than those achieved by hMetis-1.5.3. We attempt to
   provide algorithm descriptions that are as detailed and unambiguous as
   possible, to allow replicability and speed improvements in future
   research.

AB The purpose of the Berkeley project management process maturity model
   and an associated assessment methodology is to help organizations and
   people accomplish higher and more sophisticated PM maturity by a
   systematic and incremental approach. It measures, locates, and compares
   an organization's current PM maturity level. The primary advantage of
   using this model and industries, whereas other maturity models have
   specific audiences like software development or new product development.
   The maturity model and assessment technique has already been used to
   benchmark PM practices and processes in 43 companies. With it, they have
   also identified relationships between levels of organizational
   effectiveness and actual project performance data. The model is
   continuously being refined to reflect advances in their PM knowledge.
   Some of the most recent improvements include evaluating replicability of
   project success, which is the focus of this paper and presentation.

AB This paper analyses the relationship between the concepts of statistical
   significance (level of probability, p) and replicability. The level of
   statistical significance (for example, p = 0.01) indicates the
   probability of the data under the null hypothesis assumption, however,
   this does not mean that in a later replication the probability to obtain
   significant differences will be the complementary 0.99. if correctly
   understood, replicability is exclusively related to the reliability and
   consistency of the data. The only way to evaluate reliability is through
   repeated empirical tests.

AB A questionnaire designed to measure oral health-related quality of life
   (OHRQOL) in adults and children was assessed for its factorial structure
   and reliability using data from the Second International Collaborative
   Study on Oral Health Outcomes in New Zealand, Poland and Germany.
   Principal component analysis with orthogonal and oblique rotation was
   applied. The three-factor structure hypothesized for the children's
   questionnaire (self-reported oral disease symptoms, perceived oral
   well-being, social and physical functioning) was confirmed in New
   Zealand and Poland, and two self-reported oral disease symptom
   dimensions emerged in Germany. Five factors instead of the three
   hypothesized were identified for adults: two dimensions of symptoms were
   identified, and social and physical functioning appeared to be
   independent dimensions of OHRQOL. Similarity between the factors was
   demonstrated in all three countries. The reliability of the
   questionnaire ranged from moderate to excellent depending on the
   dimension and the country. These findings provide preliminary evidence
   of the cross-cultural stability of the OHRQOL questionnaire in New
   Zealand, Poland and Germany, for both children and adults. Further
   investigations by the present authors of the properties of the
   instrument in other samples will focus on demonstrating the stability
   and replicability of the factor structure identified here.

AB The paper describes the methodology of success case replication in
   various developing countries. The outline is to identify a success case,
   to assess replicability, assess the farmer's willingness to become a
   trainer, establish a practical, hands on training programme, carefully
   select trainees, supervise the training, arrange follow-up support
   services for trainees, achieve secondary multiplications after first
   level successes, and monitor the cost effectiveness of the methodology.
   Intensive field trials of the methodology were conducted from 1994-98 in
   eight countries: Bhutan, Lao PDR, Mongolia, Nepal, Philippines, Sri
   Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam. Details are presented of 32 case studies. Many
   of the projects demonstrate the work of successful women in both
   initiating a small business, and being able to pass on the skills to
   other local women.

AB Conditioned place preference (CPP) is a learning paradigm which requires
   association of reward with a particular location. White and McDonald
   (1993; Behav Brain Res 55: 269-281) demonstrated that amygdala (AMG)
   lesions impair, while fornix (Fx) lesions enhance learning in this task.
   We previously found that complete hippocampal (HPC) lesions interfere
   with normal performance. Thus, Fx and HPC lesions result in opposite
   effects in CPP. This is in contrast to spatial learning in the water
   task, where both Fx and HPC lesions are associated with acquisition
   deficits. Because it has been demonstrated that damage of dorsal HPC is
   particularly disruptive for spatial learning, we tested rats with either
   dorsal or ventral HPC lesions on CPP. To verify replicability of
   previous findings we also tested animals with Fx lesions on the same
   task. Lesions limited to dorsal HPC were followed by impairment. In
   contrast, lesions limited to ventral HPC resulted in enhanced learning.
   In agreement with previous data, Fx lesions also resulted in enhanced
   acquisition. We hypothesize that the effect of dorsal HPC lesions is
   related to interference with spatial learning, while the effect of
   ventral HPC and Fx lesions suggest increased AMG control of behavior. We
   propose that competitive interaction for behavioral output may take
   place between AMG and HPC memory systems at the level of nucleus
   accumbens.

TI All D-amino acid peptides prevent fetal death in a mouse model of fetal

SO Society for Neuroscience Abstracts
VL 26

BP Abstract No.
EP 223.5
PD 2000

AB Naturally occurring proteins and peptides have L-conformation. The
   D-conformation peptides have a potential benefit of enhanced stability
   due to their resistance to peptidases. Here we report that peptides
   synthesized with all D-amino acids are able to prevent fetal death in a
   mouse model of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). The 9 amino acid peptide
   (SAL) is from activity dependent neurotrophic factor and the 8 amino
   acid peptide (NAP) from activity dependent neuroprotective protein.
   Previously we reported that these peptides in the natural,
   L-conformation were potent protectors of in utero alcohol-induced fetal
   damage (Soc. for Neurosci 1999;25:1009). We chose a model for FAS based
   on an acute high exposure to alcohol that provided an outcome
   emphasizing the severity of alcohol-induced growth restriction and fetal
   death (Neurobehav Tox.1980 2, 227). For accurate replicability of
   alcohol and peptide administration we chose a model utilizing
   intraperitoneal injection. We chose the highest alcohol dose in the
   model (0.03ml/kg) for the most severe test of efficacy. Pregnant C57Bl6J
   mice were injected (IP) on gestational day 8 with 25% alcohol or vehicle
   with and without D-NAP and D-SAL. Animals were evaluated on gestational
   day 18. The fetal demise rate was higher in the alcohol (n=44, 37+-6%)
   than control (n=44, 7+-2%, P<.001) litters. D-NAP+D-SAL pretreatment
   resulted in a fetal death similar to control (n=10, 6+-2%, P=1) and
   significantly less than alcohol (P<.001). A combination of all D-amino
   acid ADNF-like peptides prevented alcohol-toxicity suggesting that these
   peptides may be of value in the treatment of conditions in which
   oxidative stress is involved.

AB This paper describes the process of a community-based energy planning
   and management activity that was tested and implemented under the People
   and Resource Dynamics Project in the Yarsha Khola watershed in Nepal.
   The eight main components of the activity identified during programme
   implementation are described: (1) entry into the community; (2)
   community mobilization and confidence building; (3) interaction with
   district level line agencies for micro and macro linkages; (4)
   understanding the energy consumption patterns and the technologies
   employed; (5) assessing the availability of energy resources; (6)
   balancing energy consumption and resource availability; (7) examination
   of the suitability of renewable energy technologies (RETs); and (8)
   implmentation of selected RETs. The paper examines the issue of
   replicability and sustainability of the approach in the context of
   mountain communities and identifies the key issues learned during
   programme implementation. It is concluded that the community-based
   energy planning and management approach is an effective mechanism for
   identifying the problems, priorities, needs, and aspirations of
   communities, and the presence of a research facilitator helps
   communities to solve problems by themselves.
